    "problem": "<Context> A 64-year-old man, a 30-year-long cigarette smoker (30 pieces per day), was admitted with syncope twice on one day to our hospital emergency department in Oct 17, 2013. The patient has two years of high blood pressure history while without any medicine treatment. He had no diabetes mellitus history. In the past two months, he felt chest discomfort sometimes. In the morning of Oct 14, 2013, he suddenly lost consciousness with incontinence while walking in the park. He felt pericardium discomfort before losing consciousness. After regaining consciousness several minutes later, he felt dyspnoeic and sweaty. In the afternoon, syncope occurred again while he was watching TV. His electrocardiogram showed a slight sinus bradycardia of 47 bpm. 24-hour Holter indicated the average heart rate was 66 bpm, the slowest heart rate 47 bpm, the fastest heart rate 129 bpm, and the longest R-R interval 1.6 second. Cranial CT produced no unusual findings (). Moderate ST-segment depression was determined in lead II and aVF on treadmill exercise ECG. Ultrasound cardiography (UCG) indicated normal function with the left ventricular ejection fraction 69.4%. No unusual finding was found in chest X-ray. Blood myocardial enzyme, renal function, electrolytes, and D-dimer values were all within normal ranges.\nFive days later, the patient had coronary angiography examination. Coronary angiography revealed 80% stenosis of proximal segment and 85% stenosis of distal segment in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, 90% stenosis of middle and distal segment in left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery, 50% stenosis of proximal segment, and 80% stenosis of middle segment in right coronary artery (RCA). The patient refused to have coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. So we decided to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). After balloon predilatation, 3.0 × 24 mm EXCEL rapamycin-eluting stent (Jiwei, Shandong, China) was implanted in RCA. A 2.5 × 14 mm EXCEL rapamycin-eluting stent and a 3.0 × 21 mm Partner sirolimus-eluting stent (Raisedragon, Peking, China) were implanted in distal and proximal segment of LAD, respectively. The further PCI was scheduled one week later for LCX. Unexpectedly, syncope occurred again. On the afternoon while sitting 2 days later, symptoms of dyspnea and palpation accompanied with hypotension occurred. Electrocardiogram monitor indicated that the heart rate was serious sinus bradycardia of nearly 30 bmp. Blood pressure was below 80/40 mmHg. The symptom disappeared after atropine and dopamine were infused. Consider the patient is a 64-year-old person with 30-year-long cigarettes intake history. We put a serum marker screen. Unexpectedly serum tumor marker results indicated that carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 72-4, and alpha fetoprotein are all within normal ranges whereas cytokeratin-19-fragment (CYFRA21-1) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) values elevated slightly (CYFRA21-1 3.75 ng/mL, normal <3.3 ng/mL; NSE 16.62 ng/mL, normal <16.3 ng/mL).\nExamination of enhanced chest CT led to suspicion of central lung cancer (). PET-CT confirmed the leaf of central type lung cancer (4.2 × 3.7 × 2.6 cm) of left lung with multiple lymph node metastasis and the tumor infiltration of adjacent thoracic aorta and left pulmonary artery and vein. No brain metastasis or heart metastasis was found on PET-CT examination. Immunohistochemical examination of the specimens collected with bronchoscopy revealed the following: CKpan(+), CKL(+), Syn(+), CgA(+), CD50(+), CD30(−), CK20(−), CK7(−), CK5/6(−), P63(−), and Ki-67(+).\nThe diagnosis of small cell bronchogenic carcinoma was made; this tumor was clinically staged at T4N2M0 IIIB. Chemotherapy was promptly initiated with use of combination of carboplatin and topotecan. Shortly after the first chemotherapeutic infusion, the patient reported feeling much better. At follow-up a year later, enhanced CT scan showed that the tumour volume decreased and the patient did not experience syncope anymore. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's HEART score? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> The present case report was published with the prior consent of the patient’s guardians.\nA 23-year-old, 168 cm tall female patient, weighing 42 kg, visited the emergency room with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, kept increasing gradually for eight hours. The patient was diagnosed with major depression and bulimia nervosa nine years ago. The patient also had a history of frequent vomiting after episodes of binge eating, along with numerous suicide attempts. Ten hours before reporting to the hospital, the patient ate a very large quantity food, equivalent to approximately ten portions; however, the quantity of the vomit was much less, relative to the amount of food taken. The physical examination revealed abdominal pain and distension in the entire region, along with tenderness, but no rebound tenderness. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed clear gastric distension. The results of various blood tests were normal. In the joint general surgery consultation that followed, it was decided that an immediate surgical treatment was not necessary; hence, the need for continuous observation of the condition was explained, and a gastroenterological or psychiatric hospitalization was advised, but both the patient and her guardians declined hospitalization. Afterward, they were warned of the possible complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic changes, due to the pressure applied by gastrointestinal distension, and the possibility of death, in case the condition worsened. The self-discharge form was signed, and they returned home.\nSeven hours after returning home, the patient re-visited the emergency room due to persistent abdominal pain, and mental confusion. At the time of the visit, the patient was unconscious. On physical examination, a more severe abdominal distension, and signs of abdominal rigidity were observed. Both legs of the patient had turned pale in color. No auscultation sounds were heard over the abdomen, and the dorsalis pedis pulse was not felt on either foot. Shock was suspected due to a 60/40 mmHg blood pressure, 160 beats/min heart rate, 22 times/minute aspiration rate, and 36.4℃ temperature. Other findings included pH 7.076, PaCO2 22.3 mmHg, PaO2 122 mmHg, HCO3- 6.3 mM/L, base excess (BE) 23.7 mM/L, and lactic acid 11.1 mM/L, which were measured in the arterial blood gas analysis and, thus, metabolic acidosis was confirmed. The electrolyte levels Na+ 157 mM/L, K+ 6.2 mM/L, and Cl- 130 mM/L, indicated that the electrolyte imbalance was severe (). In addition, the patient was in a severe hypoglycemic state with a blood sugar level of 15 mg/dl; because of an elevated creatinine level of 2.84 mg/dl, acute renal failure was suspected. First, to treat the metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate was set at 80 mEq/h. In the abdominal X-ray, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was seen to be filled with a large amount of food but without any bowel gas (). Abdominal CT revealed a very large dilation of the stomach, esophagus, and the second part of the duodenum; it was suspected that the distended organs were pressing against the descending aorta, and the right kidney was pressed upwards (). One hour after the emergency room re-visit, the patient's mental state became lethargic—communication became impossible and spontaneous respiration decreased; as SpO2 was measured to be 88%, endotracheal intubation was performed. A Foley catheter was then inserted, but no urine was drained; an emergency hemodialysis was prepared, and for enough fluid supply, a central venous catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein. For continuous monitoring of changes in the vital signs, a conduit was placed in the right radial artery. An attempt was made to insert a nasogastric tube to relieve gastrointestinal pressure, but the food was not drained due to a blockage near the esophagus, which made further insertion impossible. An abdominal CT performed for follow-up observation revealed that the abdomen was still filled with food, and the nasogastric tube was twisted at the end of the esophagus (). It was also suspected that insertion was not possible due to gastroesophageal junction deviation or esophageal stenosis; however, no such sign was seen.\nThere was no decompression through the nasogastric tube, and as time passed, the mental state of the patient changed into a state of confusion. The patient’s vital signs became increasingly unstable. Since the symptoms and follow-up blood test results exacerbated, instead of performing a percutaneous drainage, it was decided to attempt a surgical decompression; subsequently, the patient was transferred to the operation room six hours after the re-visit. In the emergency room, a total of 3,170 ml of crystalloid fluid, in which a 5% glucose solution was included, was administered. Urine volume was not measured.\nAfter reaching the operation room, the patient’s blood pressure was 70/46 mmHg and the heart rate was 128 beats/min. First, in order to improve the vital signs, crystalloid fluid was administered at the highest speed via the right arm’s peripheral venous catheter and via the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein. The instillation of norepinephrine was initiated with sustained dosing at an additional rate of 0.2 μg/kg/min, and continuous infusion of vasopressin at 4–8 unit/h was also initiated. Subsequently, general anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane 1–2 vol% and rocuronium 50 mg. In the arterial blood gas analysis conducted after entering the operating room, pH 7.45, PaCO2 20.8 mmHg, PaO2 335 mmHg, Na+ 161 mM/L, K+ 3.8 mM/L, glucose 205 mg/dl, lactate 13 mM/L, hemoglobin 6.8 g/dl, and HCO3- 14.4 mM/L were measured (). Four units of erythrocytes were prescribed to correct the reduced hemoglobin, and 20 mg of furosemide was injected due to a continuous lack of urination. Furthermore, for rapid transfusion, the rapid infusion system (RIS) was connected to the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein, and the transfusion of four erythrocyte units was initiated.\nThe operating surgeon planned and performed a gastrotomy, after making a skin incision of approximately 10 cm and within 20 min of beginning the surgery. The food and 5,000 ml of body fluid present in the stomach were drained via suction. Thirty minutes after the operation, blood pressure was maintained low at 60/40 mmHg and almost all food was drained; as a large amount of continuous gastric bleeding occurred after decompression, a total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle. In the follow-up arterial blood gas analysis, results showed: pH 6.75, PaCO2 46 mmHg, and lactate 20 mM/L. Acidosis had worsened, the blood sugar level had significantly increased to 469 mg/dl, electrolyte imbalance had exacerbated with K+ 7.5 mM/L, and hemoglobin had fallen to 4.3 g/dl, suggesting a large amount of bleeding. To correct this, 60 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and two units of insulin were administered. Further, 1.2 g of calcium chloride was administered to treat hyperkalemia. Moreover, additional 20 μg of epinephrine was injected to correct persistent hypotension.\nBleeding in the stomach continued, and despite initiating erythrocyte transfusion via RIS, hemoglobin level decreased. As a result, a large amount of internal bleeding was suspected, and additional eight units of erythrocytes, and eight units of fresh frozen plasma were prescribed. The operating surgeon tried to determine the cause and area of bleeding, but as the surgical incision was only 10 cm, abdominal organs other than the stomach could not be identified with the naked eye. To reduce bleeding, the operating surgeon considered performing a total gastrectomy or extending the abdominal incision to confirm the bleeding areas from, other organs but concluded that the bleeding was due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after surgical decompression, and DIC. Since the patient’s vital signs steadily worsened, it was decided that the abdomen be closed urgently, and the patient moved to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nOne hour after the start of the operation, suturing after gastrectomy was completed. When the closing of the abdomen started, non-invasive blood pressure was not measured, and flat waveforms were observed in the catheter of the right radial artery. There was no pulse detected via palpation, and after confirming pulseless electrical activity through the observation of electrocardiogram, an additional 1 mg of epinephrine was injected, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated.\nA total of 3 mg of epinephrine was injected, with cardiac rhythm monitoring at 2 min intervals; afterward, 2 units of vasopressin were injected at 2 min intervals, totaling an injection of 4 units of vasopressin. After completing the abdominal closure while performing CPR, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and no urine output was seen until the patient left the operation room.\nThe operation was conducted for 1 h 20 min, and the anesthesia time was 1 h 50 min. During the operation, a total of 800 ml, four erythrocyte units, were transfused, and 6,200 ml of crystalloid fluid were administered. A total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle—5,000 ml of food and body fluid through the suction unit via gastrectomy, and 1000 ml due to bleeding that had occurred after decompression from the start of the operation until finish; however, as mentioned earlier, the incision area was small, and bleeding occurring from other abdominal organs could not be confirmed, making it difficult to estimate the exact estimated blood loss. Additionally, prescribed erythrocytes and fresh frozen plasma were transfused through the RIS as the patient left the operation room.\nAfter entering the ICU, CPR was stopped due to a return of spontaneous circulation, but the existing usage of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin was preserved, and transfusion continued. However, blood pressure was still not measured, an additional 1,000 ml of bleeding was confirmed through the nasogastric tube, and bleeding from the closed abdominal area continued. Subsequently, as 3.5 g/dl hemoglobin was measured in the follow-up test, transfusion continued, and a 113.1-second prothrombin time, 180-s activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count of 22,000/μl were found, confirming that the patient was in a state of DIC. Despite continuous drug administration and transfusion, the hemoglobin level decreased to 1.8 g/dl, and after three hours in the ICU, the heartbeat disappeared, and the patient was declared dead. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "4.37",
    "Upper Limit": "4.83",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 161.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 161.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 161.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 161.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 161.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 161.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 130.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 14.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 14.4 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 14.4 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 14.4 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 14.4 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 14.4 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 161.0 mEq/L - (130.0 mEq/L + 14.4 mEq/L) = 16.6 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 16.6 mEq/L. Plugging in 16.6 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 16.6 - 12 = 4.6 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 4.6 mEq/L.",

As told by the parents, this young man had inflicted self-injury by a nail driven inside his skull with the help of a wooden plank []. It takes about 1.5 h before reaching hospital. At the time of admission in emergency department, on examination this right-handed patient was fully conscious and oriented, talkative with no history of headache, vomiting, seizures, visual disturbances, and with a Glassgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15\\15. There were no focal signs (with intact higher functions, no limbs weakness, sensory loss, bladder bowel involvement, facial asymmetry, and cranial nerves involvement) and a nail was protruding out of his skull in midline approximately 2 cm out near coronal suture. The vitals were as follows: blood pressure 110\\66 mmHg, pulse 88\\min of normal character, respiratory rate 18\\min, pallor +, JVP normal, hydration was adequate, pupil normal size normal reaction, and plantar B\\L flexor. This patient had a history of such suicidal attempts four times in the past; last one was almost 4 months back and he was on and off taking anti-psychotic treatment, details of which was not available. Patient was put on conservative treatment along with antibiotics (injection cefurexime BD, amikacin 500 BD, metrogyl 100 ml TDS), antiepileptic drugs (injection eptoin TDS), and antipsychotic treatment sodium valproate, escitalopram, olanzipine, and alprazolam. An urgent plain X-ray of head and neck AP and lateral view [Figures and ] and non-contract CT scan (NCCT) head [] was performed.\nPatient was planned for emergency frontal craniotomy.

Inj ranitidine 25 mg and inj metoclopramide 10 mg had already been given intramuscularly 45 min earlier, and nasal Ryle's tube was put at the time of admission before operation as prophylaxis for full stomach to prevent aspiration. In operation theatre, invasive arterial and central venous line was put after local anesthetic infiltration to measure beat to beat variability in blood pressure and large volume fluid shift intraoperatively with two large bore intravenous cannula after that craniotomy done under balanced general anesthesia with rapid sequence induction. Intraoperatively colloids, blood products, and inotropes were kept ready with monitoring SPO2, ETCO2, ECG, urine output, and temperature. Under full aseptic precaution, frontal craniotomy was done. Bone chips were removed around nail without disturbing nail for proper exposure .Then the nail was removed very slowly in line of its original axis to avoid bleeding. Wound site was decontaminated and drain was put, and then aseptically flap was reposited. Vitals were maintained within normal limit during entire intraoperative period. There occurred a small rent in superior sagittal sinus during removal of nail. The bleeding was controlled by the surgeon with the help of gel foams, surgicell, suction, and bipolar cautery. After surgery, the patient was successfully extubated with stable vitals and shifted to intensive care unit. Rest of the postoperative phase was uneventful. Treatment with antibiotic and anti-psychotic drugs was continued similarly to the preoperative phase.\nThe wound was on the left side of the scalp with the nail directing toward right frontal lobe, which is an eminent center and involved in motor function, memory, language, social, and sexual function. The patient was discharged after 8 days along with psychiatric and psychological counseling. He was conscious and oriented without any neurological deficit. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 14.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 140.0 mg/dL.

During this time, she had been hospitalized during 4 months with a transitory gain of six kilograms. She was treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitor and denied taking illicit drug or potentially harmful products. On admission, she presented hypotension (90/50 mmHg), sinus bradycardia (40 bpm), slight hypoglycemia (3.9 mmol/L), and hypothermia (35.7°C). She measured 160 cm and her body weight was 36 kg, corresponding to a body mass index (BMI) of 14 kg/m2. At physical examination she was oriented but lethargic and slightly jaundiced. The abdomen was slightly tender without ascites. The liver was not enlarged.\nLaboratory data at admission demonstrated the following: glycemia (3.5 mmol/L), Na+ 137 mmol/L (N: 136–144), K+ 3.7 mmol/L (3.6–4.6), total Ca2+ 2.34 mmol/L (N: 2.2–2.52), Mg2+ 1.10 mmol/L (N: 0.65–1.05), P2− 1.22 (N: 0.8–1.5), and osmolality 289 mOsm/kg. Platelets were at 144 G/L (N: 150–350), hemoglobin was at 133 g/L (N: 120–160), and leucocytes were at 6.6 G/L (N: 4–11). The liver function tests was abnormal with a factor V at 33% (N: >70%). Serum aminotransferase levels were increased as follow: AST 208 U/L (N: 11–42), ALT 341 (N: 9–42), and total bilirubin 65 μmol/L (N: 7–25). The vitamin C was normal at 78 umol/L (N: 17–85) as was the thiamine at 208 umol/L (N: 65–200).\nShe was treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitor and denied taking illicit drug or potentially harmful products. Her treatment was stopped, but laboratory tests continued to deteriorate.\nAfter one week, the laboratory routine tests revealed abnormal hematological tests with hemoglobin at 114 g/L, leucopenia at 2.5 G/L, and thrombocytopenia at 52 G/L. Additional investigations included prealbumin: 121 mg/L (N: 223–380) and albumin: 36 g/L (N: 35–48). Electrolytes remained normal. Renal and thyroid functions were unremarkable. Liver tests were as follows: AST 1088 U/L, ALT 1868 U/L, GGT 138 U/L, PA 102 U/L, and total bilirubin 66 μmol/L. INR was at 1.02 and factor V at 85%. Additional laboratory tests were performed to exclude all possible causes of liver injury. Hepatitis A, B, C, and E, CMV, and HIV tests were negative. Autoantibodies were absent; iron studies and ceruloplasmin were normal. At abdominal ultrasound the liver appeared normal with no ascites. Portal and hepatic veins were unremarkable. Thus, a diagnosis of acute liver injury associated with anorexia nervosa was considered the most plausible diagnosis.\nA careful and progressive refeeding was performed, but liver transaminases remained abnormal. Thus, 10 days after hospital admission, a liver biopsy was performed by the transjugular route.\nAt histology, architecture of the liver was normal without fibrosis. Portal tracts and biliary and vascular structures were normal. Cytoplasm of hepatocytes was clarified and some acidophil bodies were found predominant in the centrilobular region. In addition, ceroid pigments at the apical pole of the hepatocytes were observed ().\nAn electron microscopy study was also performed in a fragment of liver biopsy, which showed features that strongly suggested a phenomenon of autophagocytosis: the density of glycogen particles in the hepatocytes was very low, consistent with cytoplasm clarification on PAS staining at the optical microscopy. In addition, the number of both mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum appeared to be reduced. This observation contrasts with an increased number of Golgi bodies and smooth endoplasmic reticulum as well as primary and secondary lysosomes containing digested material ().

The pupils were round and reactive with normal reflexes. Right-eye refraction was −6.00 −1.00 × 30°, and left-eye was −5.00 −1.50 × 20°. We did not perform visual acuity and peripheral vision exams due to an underaged uncooperative patient. Under anesthesia, we observed a translucent right cornea with a horizontal diameter of 12.5 mm, a well-formed narrow anterior chamber (depth 1.04 mm), closed iridocorneal angle in 360°, round translucent crystallin protruding anteriorly, and intraocular pressure of 26 mm Hg (Fig. , ). Left eye examination evidenced a corneal horizontal diameter of 11.5 mm with an open iridocorneal angle in all four quadrants. Additionally, multiple iridian processes with a posterior embryotoxon in the temporal sector were present. The intraocular pressure on tonometry was 14 mm Hg. Fundoscopic examination revealed an excavated papilla of 90% OD and 40% OS with no other retinal or macular changes. Based on these findings, we diagnosed right microspherophakia with phacomorphic glaucoma.

    "problem": "<Context> A 43-year old male presented with a history of proteinuria discovered on a routine medical examination in 1985 when he was 22 years old. His medical history was acute pancreatitis at age 17 and hypertension at age 40, and the family history indicated that his nephew had IgA nephropathy. The patient occasionally consumes alcohol, but doesn’t smoke. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent a renal biopsy for suspected active nephritis because of the finding (Table ) of hematuria 3+ protein from pooled urine 0.78 g/day and a plasma creatinine (Cr) level of 1.16 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 71 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Pathologic examination revealed IgA nephropathy with partial cellular crescent formation in 1 of the 12 glomeruli, slight mesangial matrix expansion, and mild atrophy of the renal tubule and interstitium. He was followed up without treatment, and the urinary abnormalities resolved spontaneously. He stopped visiting the hospital 3 years after the first visit because of the repeated negative urine analysis and did not visit any other hospital thereafter. He continued to undergo routine medical examinations, which were intermittently positive for microhematuria and proteinuria. His next visit to a medical institution was in 2002 at 38 years of age and revealed urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 1+, plasma Cr 1.13 mg/dl and hypertension. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was started. After that, he saw a doctor regularly, but hematuria and proteinuria became gradually worse. A relapse of IgA nephropathy was suspected. In March 2009, he was admitted to a hospital for renal biopsy to evaluate the progression of IgA nephropathy.\nThe patient's general condition at the time of hospitalization was height 163.0 cm, weight 55.0 kg, body mass index 20.7 kg/m2, blood pressure 116/72 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats/min and temperature 36.6 °C. He was lucid with no sign of anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva. No swelling of the throat, abnormal chest auscultation, hard and tender points in the abdominal area or edema of the extremities was observed. Medical examinations (Table ) revealed urine protein 3+ (0.90 g/day), urine occult blood 3+ (RBC 10–19/HPF) and serum Cr 1.63 mg/dl.\nRenal biopsy (Fig. ) showed 4 global scleroses, 3 cellular crescent formations and 3 adhesions in 28 glomeruli; moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix; moderate tubular atrophy with mild cell infiltration in the interstitium; and moderate arteriolosclerosis and thickening of interlobular arteries. Immunostaining of IgA confirmed the diagnosis of active chronic-progressive IgA nephropathy.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy. Steroid pulse therapy was given as follows: methylprednisolone was administered continuously at a pulsed dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg continuously for 3 weeks. After completion of the third course, oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 30 mg/day every other day after treatment and tapered by 5 mg every 2 months. The after-treatment follow-up was continued for 1 year. The patient underwent tonsillectomy after discharge from the hospital (day 75) and was then followed up at the outpatient clinic. He completed oral prednisolone treatment in approximately a year, but continued taking an ARB during the follow-up period. Clinical remission was achieved 7 months after the initiation of therapy (Table ), and hematuria and proteinuria were no longer observed in this 3-year follow-up period (Fig. ). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 43 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.63 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 163.0 cm, which is 163.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.63 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.63 m * 1.63 m) = 20.701 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.7, indicating they are normal weight. Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 55.0 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 43) * 55.0 * 1) / (1.63 * 72) = 45.458 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 45.458 mL/min.",

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 102.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 102.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 102.0 mEq chloride.

    "problem": "<Context> Our patient was a 32-year-old man, coming from a country with low availability of factor replacement therapy, height 185 cm, weight 90 kg, professional driver, with severe haemophilia A (F VIII < 1%). Family history positive for severe haemophilia A (his aunt was affected). The diagnosis of severe haemophilia A occurred in his hometown during childhood because he was involved in several atraumatic intra-articular haemorrhages in the elbows, ankles and knees.\nIn March 2017, after an accidental fall skiing, he reported a blunt trauma of the right iliac wing with development of blood collection in that site.\nPelvic X-rays and bone biopsy were performed at the local hospital and osteosarcoma was excluded. In July 2017 he went to another Haemophilia Centre for the appearance of swelling, fistulisation, leakage of serum blood material and functional limitation of the right hip. He also reported an evening fever of >39°. The physical examination also revealed severe atraumatic functional limitation of the left elbow and the right ankle. Laboratory tests performed showed F VIII <1%, F VIII inhibitors: 0 BU/mL. A pelvis CT was performed, showing the presence of an abscess and a fistula at the right iliac crest (). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the culture swab, therefore antibiotic therapy with Teicoplanin + Rifampicin was introduced but subsequently suspended for gastrointestinal intolerance. The patient started prophylaxis with pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg three times a week. In June 2018, the patient was referred to our Clinic for right hip swelling, fistulisation, serum secretion, pain and functional limitation. Blood exams at the entrance showed Hb 8.6 g/dL, aPTT 40 s, F VIII 20.7% (range 70–120%), inhibitors F VIII 0 BU/mL, PCR 4.4 mg/dL (<0.5). A contrast medium pelvic CT scan demonstrated the presence, at the right iliac wing, of a large (10.1 × 14.2 × 10.7 cm) osteolytic lesion, inhomogeneous, septate and bounded by a peripheral wall of irregular thickness (6–7 mm). The lesion interrupted the cortical bone on both the posterior and anterior side of the iliac bone, also involving the sacroiliac joint plane and the sacral joint surface at S1-level. The lesion infiltrated both the gluteal muscle lodge posteriorly and the deep plane of the ileo-psoas muscle anteriorly. In addition, the presence of two subcutaneous fistulous communications was demonstrated, reaching the cutaneous plane respectively along the lateral side of the right flank and in the right paravertebral posterior lumbar region, at L5-level. Considering the patient’s medical history of haemophilia, a diagnosis of pseudotumour of the right iliac wing with an additional overlapping inflammatory-infectious complication was made.\nSurgical treatment to remove the pseudotumour was proposed and accepted by the patient.\nPd-FVIII 20 IU/Kg were administered pre-operatively as a slow intravenous bolus every 12 h for seven days before surgery.\nThe day of the surgery, the patient underwent selective embolisation with Embosphere® 500–700 of the right superficial gluteal artery and the right lumbar artery ().\nJust before the anaesthesia, pd-FVIII 50 IU/Kg was administered as a slow intravenous bolus. After that, 1 g of vancomycin was administered intravenously as intra-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. Under general anaesthesia, the patient has been placed in the lateral decubitus position. Support placed under the thorax allowed to put the patient’s pelvic area into a three-quarter anterior and posterior pelvic tilt during the intervention. Anterolateral and posterior access to the pelvis were used. The incision started along the contours of the iliac crest in a curvilinear manner and ends in the back with a vertical portion on the sacroiliac joint. The wing of the ilium and the sacrum are exposed, allowing for safety margins around the pseudotumour, which extend into the soft tissue. The iliac muscle was sectioned and detached from the endopelvic side of the ilium. The iliac vessels, ureter, lumbosacral trunk, sacral roots and sciatic nerve were identified and protected. On the exopelvic side, the gluteus muscles were moved as a unit with their fascia and skin, creating a lower myocutaneous flap.\nAfter a layered dissection of the soft tissues, we reached the pseudotumour which appeared as a voluminous brownish-red mass with a pasty-like consistency; its capsule was emptied and removed. Subsequently, the right iliac crest was custom-fit by means of a pedicle-screw and rod system (PSRS), a metal bar and two fixing screws (one in correspondence with the acetabulum and the other on the sacro-iliac synchondrosis). Dead space between the implants and the remaining bone were therefore filled by antibiotic coated bone cement with the aid of two polyglycolic acid MESH in order to build up an artificial ilium-like bony mass, as well as graft compression.\nFinally, two treble hooks were positioned for repositioning the pelvic muscles. One surgical drain was placed at the end of the surgery. Intraoperatively, a biopsy of the lesion demonstrated the presence of fibrin-haematic organised material with fragments of necro-inflammatory material and scattered microcalcifications. Swabs in fistulous passages were also performed and they showed that there was no superinfection. The patient was transfused intraoperatively with one unit of RBC\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, pd-FVIII 20 IU/Kg was administered as bolus, then pd-FVIII 20 IU/kg every 12 h on the first postoperative day; from the second post-operative day pd-FVIII 20 UI/Kg at 8 a.m. and 10 UI/Kg at 8 p.m., up to the 4th day postoperatively; from the fifth post-operative day pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg at 8 a.m. and 10 IU/Kg at 8 p.m. for two weeks, with the aim of maintaining F VIII level > 50%. Every 48 h, before the administration of concentrate of FVIII, blood was taken to check Hb, PTT and FVIII. The variations of FVIII biological activity levels during the hospital stay are summarised in . Antibiotic intravenous post-operative prophylaxis with Vancomycin 500 mg every 12 h was continued until surgical drain removal. The surgical drain was kept for 24 h and then removed with a residual volume of 300 mL of serosanguinous liquid.\nThe patient was transfused with one RBC unit the day-4, the day-6 and the day-7 after surgery owing to post-operative anaemia. A 21-days hospital stay was necessary in order to achieve a good clinical condition.\nIn the immediate post-operative period, X-ray and CT of the pelvis showed emptying of the pseudotumour and correct positioning of screws and metal cerclage (). Physiotherapy was started during hospitalisation, from day-1 after surgery and continued during the hospital stay. The patient was discharged at home with the indications for the continuation of physiotherapy, with cautious and progressive recovery of total flexion of the trunk and right thigh. Walking was allowed with aids and load pain-compatible. The patient continued replacement therapy with recombinant F VIII and analgesic therapy with paracetamol. At discharge blood exams showed Hb 8.4 g/dL, aPTT 30.7 s, FVIII 96.5%, CRP 1.3 mg/dL, ESR 109 mm/h (<10). During the rehabilitation period the patient prophylaxis scheme was pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg every other day. At the first outpatient visit, 8 days after discharge, the patient was in good general condition, he walked with aids, and the pain was well-controlled. The stitches were removed and medicated, no signs of inflammation were noted. Pelvis X-ray unchanged compared to the post-operative one. One month later the patient went to another emergency room for leakage of blood serum material from the surgical scar. A positive culture swab was found for MSSA. After two days, the patient was re-evaluated at our clinic, a wound dehiscence was observed, thus indication for wound revision was given. Five days later, the patient had a feverish episode (T 42 °C) with shaking chills and PCR increase. A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was begun and pd-FVIII 3000 IU at 8 and 1000 U at 20 was continued. Therefore, the patient was hospitalised at our Institution for wound surgical revision. Blood exams at the entrance showed Hb 10.6 g/dL, leukocytes 5.37 × 103/uL (4.00–10.00), CRP 0.97 mg/dL, ESR 85 mm/h. Preoperatively, pelvic CT was performed, and it showed a voluminous collection of infected blood fluids both on the pelvic side along the planes of the ileo-psoas muscle and on the buttock side. The fluid collection extended to the paravertebral musculature, the quadrate loin muscle, and the external oblique muscle superiorly and posteriorly. In the postero-superior site, the collection went beyond the muscle fascia and extended into the subcutaneous fat layer. Therefore, surgical toilet and abundant irrigation was performed. During the surgical procedure, swabs were carried out for culture tests, later found negative for infection. The patient was discharged with a recommendation to continue antibiotic therapy with Rifampicin and Levofloxacin for 5 days and to continue the factor VIII replacement therapy. In this second hospitalisation a 11-days hospital stay was necessary in order to achieve optimal medical condition.\nPatients were followed at outpatient clinic, at 7, 14 and 21 days. He was always in good general condition with surgical wound healed without signs of inflammation. Right hip ROM was almost complete at one month with control X-ray () unchanged than the post-operative one. At the 6- and 12-month outpatient visit the patient was in good clinical conditions, he denied disorders or functional limitations in every-day life. Currently, the patient is checked with an X-ray every 6 months.\nThe patient continued prophylaxis with pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg three times a week. No further bleeding manifestations occurred. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He also noted decreased appetite with a 50-pound weight loss over the past 5 months. He had no significant past medical or surgical history and was not taking any medications. His family history was unremarkable. He quit smoking tobacco two months ago due to worsening respiratory status; he rarely used alcohol and never used recreational drugs. He was unmarried and in a long-term heterosexual relationship and denied multiple sexual partners. He was currently working in an automobile parts factory as a janitor. After high school he had enlisted in the army and served for four years; at that time he was stationed in Hawaii. While in Hawaii he visited a single prostitute on several occasions.\nInitial vital signs revealed temperature was 99.9 F, blood pressure 128/83 mmHg, pulse 134 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. He was in moderate respiratory distress, yet was awake, alert, and cooperative. Extraocular muscles were intact; there was no nystagmus or scleral icterus. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. He had thrush under his tongue and on the palate. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Heart rate was regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops by auscultation. There were no palpable thrills. He had equal chest rise bilaterally. Breath sounds were diminished throughout, with rales and dullness to percussion in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Sensory and motor examination was grossly intact.\nLaboratory data revealed white blood count 13,900/mcL, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, platelets 370,000/mcL, sodium 131 mmol/L potassium 5.8 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 17 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 155 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 8.9 mg/dL. Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.39, pCO2 32.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 19.1 mmol/L, and pO2 74.5 mmHg on 3 L nasal cannula. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities (). He was found to be HIV positive with CD4 count of <5 cells/cc and viral load of 1,180,000 copies. Bronchoalveolar lavage was preformed; Grocott's methenamine silver stain of the washings demonstrated Pneumocystis jiroveci (). He received antibiotics and steroids with gradual improvement.\nOn hospital day 14, he became confused and acutely developed nystagmus with both a horizontal and prominent vertical component. He was also found to have ataxia with finger to nose testing and difficulty sitting up without support. Considering his immunosuppressed state, infectious and neoplastic etiologies were the primary diagnostic considerations. Lumbar puncture revealed clear CSF, normal opening pressure, and normal cell counts. Polymerase chain reactions for Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and John Cunningham (JC) virus were negative. Nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis (VDRL), toxoplasmosis antibody, and Cryptococcus antigen titers were negative. CT of the head did not show any intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or other acute findings. MRI of the brain revealed a slight increase in T2 signal within the medial aspect of thalamus bilaterally (). After excluding infection and neoplasm, the clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy was made. Intravenous thiamine was administered resulting in resolution of symptoms, which confirmed the diagnosis. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.175",
    "Upper Limit": "0.193",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 131.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 131.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 131.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 131.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 131.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 19.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 19.1 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 19.1 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 19.1 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 19.1 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 19.1 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 131.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 19.1 mEq/L) = 12.9 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.9 mEq/L. Plugging in 12.9 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.9 - 12 = 0.9 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0.9 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 0.9 mEq/L / 4.899999999999999 mEq/L = 0.184. The patient's delta ratio is 0.184.",

Accompanying this was hip and back pain after a fall. This occurred on a background of unexplained progressive weight loss of 40 kilograms over the past 2 years, poor appetite, fever and drenching night sweats, increased susceptibility to infection, and intravenous drug use. He had a 16-year history of hepatitis C (HCV; genotype 3), which remained untreated due to noncompliance and poor clinic attendance. He had been a well-built professional boxer of 96 to 100 kilograms for most of his adult life; however, his admission weight was 60.61 kilograms. This was a loss of approximately 63% of his total body weight. His relevant medical history includes postoperative pulmonary embolism, disc prolapse, mild depression, and a family history of adult polycystic kidney disease. The relevant surgical history includes osteomyelitis and amputation of the third digit of the right hand, and multiple fracture repairs. Systems review was unremarkable. He has a complicated social history including a troubled upbringing, intravenous heroin use up to 1 gram per day, experimentation with most illicit drugs, a significant criminal history, and participation in an opiate substitution programme. He does not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol.\nOn examination, the patient appeared acutely unwell, although vital signs were normal. He appeared cachectic, had sunken eyes, reduced skin turgor, poor dentition, extensive tattoos, and had track marks in the cubital fossae and groin. There was rib and mediastinal tenderness with no masses. Right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness was noted on palpation, with hepatomegaly 6 centimetres below the costal margin. Nontender lymphadenopathy was present in the upper left jugular nodes and bilaterally in the groin. A warm, right knee effusion was also apparent. There were no signs suggestive of infective endocarditis or chronic liver disease. Respiratory, cardiovascular, thyroid, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\nInitial blood biochemistry revealed a noncritical normocytic normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 102 g/L), raised CRP, elevated calcium (2.57 mmol/L), and low albumin (23 grams/L). A thyroid function test detected 18 picomols/L of free T4 (normal range 7–17 pmols/L). This was assumed to be a transient reactive elevation rather than the cause of such significant weight loss. Liver function tests, blood cultures, electrolytes, renal function, coagulation profile, α-fetoprotein, vasculitic screen, iron studies, vitamin B12, urate, and globulins were all within normal ranges. Hepatitis C serology was reactive with an IgG response. forth generation antigen/antibody assay was performed twice, four weeks apart, to determine HIV positivity; however, both tests returned negative. The patient's history revealed that previous HIV tests were also negative, and as such a Western blot analysis was not performed. Hepatitis B serology was consistent with immunisation. Polymerase chain reaction found the patient to be reactive to cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), but human herpes virus 8 was not detected. Although blood IL-6 levels could have been used as a marker of systemic inflammation, C-reactive protein was chosen instead as per hospital policies. A computerized tomography of the chest and abdomen found enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes and lytic lesions in T8 and T9. There was no splenomegaly, and the liver architecture was unchanged.\nA computerized tomography pulmonary angiogram, chest X-ray, and cardiac troponin I were requested to exclude pulmonary embolism, rib fracture and pneumothorax, and myocardial infarction. All were normal. The right knee joint was aspirated, and fluid analysis showed methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus which was treated as septic arthritis with intravenous flucloxacillin and vancomycin. Following spiking fevers over the next few weeks in hospital, a transoesophageal echocardiogram was performed to exclude infective endocarditis from a septic arthritis-induced bacteraemia.\nAt this point, the patient was clinically suspected to have lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and further investigations undertaken were to exclude either. β-2 microglobulin and LDH levels were normal, no monoclonal band was detected on serum and urine protein electropheresis, and flow cytometry showed normal subpopulations of B cell and T cell lineages. A bone scan showed further destructive thoracic lesions but did not confirm its extent. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed T8 to T11 osteomyelitis with epidural involvement indenting on, but not compressing, the spinal cord. Lymphoma and multiple myeloma were excluded by bone marrow biopsy.\nThe diagnosis of multicentric plasmacytic Castleman's disease was histologically confirmed by an excision biopsy from an inguinal lymph node. Macroscopically, the specimen was a circumscribed ovoid nodule measuring 30 × 22 × 10 mm with a central blackish area. Microscopically, no malignant cells, Reed Sternberg cells, or their variants were seen. This was confirmed by two separate laboratories. Also noted were distinct hyaline deposits, prominent paracortical expansion by sheets of plasma cells, and subcapsular and interfollicular neutrophilic bodies. HHV-8 was not detected in this sample.\nA four-week rituximab regime was chosen as the primary treatment for this patient. Steroid treatment was also being considered as adjunct therapy. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

    "Lower Limit": "12.692",
    "Upper Limit": "14.028",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL). The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 23.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 23.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.3 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 23.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 2.3 g Albmumin/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 2.57 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 2.57 mmol. To convert 2.57 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.57 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.12 g Calcium. To convert 0.12 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.12 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 120.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 120.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 12.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 2.57 mmol Calcium/L converts to 12.0 mg Calcium/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 2.3 g/dL)) + 12.0 mg/dL = 13.36 mg/dL. The patient's corrected calcium concentration 13.36 mg/dL.",

He was diagnosed with bilateral CLP and mandibular prognathism associated with midface deficiency, and was scheduled to undergo LeFort I osteotomy, right iliac block bone graft procedure, and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. He had previously undergone cheiloplasty, palatoplasty, cleft maxillary repair, and pharyngoplasty to correct the CLP. Preoperative laboratory findings, chest X-ray image, and electrocardiogram were normal. He had no other diseases, including upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.\nHe had maxillary deficiency with malocclusion, mandibular prognathism, a scar due to a pharyngeal flap, and cheiloplasty. As a premedication, glycopyrolate (0.2 mg) was injected intramuscularly. Standard monitoring was performed in the operating room. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (1 µg/kg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg). After providing adequate muscle relaxation, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB)-guided NTI was attempted using a nasotracheal tube (NTT) of 6.5 mm internal diameter; this procedure was performed instead of a direct rigid laryngoscope because FFB technique and smaller sized NTT are more suitable for adults who have intact pharyngeal flaps. The FFB was inserted into the both nostrils for examination and passed through the posterior pharynx; we observed that the velopharyngeal port (between the nasopharynx and oropharynx) was divided into two small-sized pharyngeal ports by the pharyngeal flap (). Because right side of pharyngeal port was a little wider, a scope was passed carefully through the right side pharyngeal port and vocal cords to the carina; NTT was passed over the FFB smoothly. There was no specific resistance during NTT insertion, but minor bleeding appeared on the nasopharynx. After the intubation, the patient was mechanically ventilated to administer desflurane (6 vol%), with a fresh gas flow rate of 3 L/min and 50% oxygen in air. After the induction of anesthesia, active bleeding was observed in the mouth immediately. To assess the bleeding focus, we examined the oral cavity with a dental mirror, and bleeding was seen at the pharyngeal flap. The flap was probably torn at the time of the NTI. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved using a 4 × 4 gauze moistened with 1:1000 epinephrine solution. After the bleeding was controlled, cotton swabs soaked in 2% lidocaine and 1:1000 epinephrine were inserted into the torn flap and nostril. Subsequently, the pharyngeal bleeding stopped, and the surgery was completed without further complications. After the surgery, the patient recovered without any problems. A follow-up examination using a nasendoscopic view that was performed two years later showed that the pharyngeal flap remained intact after the recovery ().

After 5 months, he evolved with disorientation and dyspnea on exertion and was taken to the hospital. Physical examination showed skin and mucous membrane pallor, hepatosplenomegaly and lower-limb edema.\nThe patient had a history of cigarettes and alcohol consumption. The first laboratory tests showed creatinine 4.3 mg/dL, urea 246 mg/dL (), hypergammaglobulinemia in plasma protein electrophoresis, in urinalysis 369 red cells per high-power field and proteinuria (1+/4+). Due to evident signs of AKI, classified as KDIGO 3, hemodialysis was started. On the same day, rK39 antigen test was positiveand a bone marrow aspirate evidenced amastigote-like forms of Leishmania donovani, confirming VL diagnosis. Leishmania antigen dosage was not performed. Serologies for hepatitis virus B, C and HIV were negative. Complement test levels were C3-55 mg/dL and C4- 15 mg/dL. VDRL, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, FAN and anti-ds-DNA tests showed negative results. Renal biopsy showed rapidly progressive, post-infectious glomerulonephritis with mesangial hypercellularity and endocapillary proliferation (). Immunofluorescence was positive for IgM, C3 and C1q. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for Leishmania on the renal biopsy was not performed. Treatment consisted of liposomal amphotericin B 200 mg a day for 7 days and 1 g of methylprednisolone a day for three days. Renal function improved and dialysis was discontinued (). The transthoracic echocardiography showed ejection fraction (EF) of 51%, significant tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation, mild pericardial effusion in the left ventricle (LV) and significant pericardial effusion in the left atrium, with eccentric LV hypertrophy. The patient was discharged with the following prescriptions: enalapril, amlodipine and prednisone 60 mg/day. Five months later, the man sought medical care at the emergency room due to symptoms of cardiac decompensation, wheezing, irregular heart rhythm with a fourth heart sound. The electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation and the transthoracic echocardiography showed EF of 25%, moderate mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation (AF) and dilated cardiomyopathy showing systolic function worsening. He also had positive IgG antibodies for Chagas disease by two methods (ELISA – titer > 1.8 and IFA – titer > 1:160), but there was no need for dialysis during this second hospitalization and the heart condition was defined as a complication of chronic Chagas disease. After compensating for his medical condition, the patient was discharged, is currently receiving outpatient care, and is no longer taking prednisone (the patient has already weaned it). He is currently receiving enalapril, 5 mg a day, carvedilol 12.5 mg twice a day, digoxin 0.25 mg a day, spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 40 mg/day and warfarin 7.5 mg/day.\nClinical and laboratory findings, after the patient was discharged from the hospital, confirmed the patient's renal function improvement throughout the months (). </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 48 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 4.3 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.

He weighed 70 kg and was 168 cm tall. The patient was paraplegic. One of the bullets entered from the left arm pit and left the body from the right scapula. There was another bullet entrance from the right upper abdominal quadrant. His relatives did not present any history of previous medical issues or regular use of medications. Chest roentgenogram and computerized tomography scans indicated hemopneumothorax in the left hemithorax with destruction of the upper lobe of the left lung. In addition, the vertebral corpuses of T4 and T5 were severely destructed. There were liver and spleen injuries with intra-abdominal fluid accumulation.\nA chest tube was inserted emergently into the left hemithorax and revealed 650 ml hemorrhagic fluid drainage and resulted in expansion of the lung. He was intubated, and vertebral stabilization surgery, as well as laparotomy to treat hepatic and splenic lacerations was performed. The patient was followed at the intensive care unit, however could not be extubated. His status deteriorated on the third day (PaO2/FiO2 became 154). Endotracheal aspiration and wound cultures resulted negative. The appearance of the lungs worsened on chest roentgenograms, and we diagnosed him as ARDS according to the ARDS Berlin Criteria. Despite various mechanical ventilation and physiotherapy attempts, the status of the lungs did not improve and PaO2/FiO2 ratio became 53 and pulmonary compliance decreased to 18 ml/cmH2O. We decided to institute V-V ECMO with echocardiography guidance [], despite the risk of bleeding due to multiple penetrating injuries and recent surgical treatment. ECMO flow was adjusted to 2 lt/min at a rate of 9,000 rpm, mechanic ventilator FiO2 of 0.6, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, tidal volume of 420 ml, peak inspirium pressure of (PIP) 24 mmH2O, and inspiration/expiration ratio of 1/1 which were adjusted according to the blood gas analysis. However, we needed to gradually increase the flow of ECMO to 6 lt/min due to worsening of oxygenation. V-V ECMO in conjunction with mechanic ventilation provided sufficient gas exchange ().\nThe patient developed septic cardiomyopathy which was confirmed with echocardiography indicating severely depressed myocardial functions (ejection fraction of 35%) on the postoperative 13th day, despite wide-spectrum antibiotherapy with vancomycin and meropenem. Although cultures were negative, white blood cell count increased to 19/uL, thrombocyte count decreased to 66/uL, CRP increased to 234 mg/L, procalcitonin increased to 8.5 ng/ml, and total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels increased to 18 mg/dl and 16 mg/dl, respectively. His inotropic score gradually increased to 40 and we decided veno-arterio-venous (hybrid) ECMO with addition of V-A ECMO to the femoral artery and vein. The deterioration in patient's hemodynamics, echocardiography findings, and blood gas analysis are presented in .\nHis status gradually improved in time and he was weaned off V-A-V ECMO with rapid consecutive conversion to V-V ECMO for a few hours and then completely disconnected on the 20th day with decreased leucocyte count (9/uL), increased thrombocyte count (163/uL), decreased CRP (63), and decreased total bilirubin (3/uL) levels. His mechanical ventilation parameters were FiO2 0.5, P/F 262, PEEP 8 cmH2O, TV 450 ml, PIP 23 cmH2O, I/E 1/2, and compliance 37 ml/cmH2O which were confirmed with chest X-ray ().

C-MRI protocol consisted of balanced steady-state free precession (BSSFP) cine-imaging, T2-weighted and T1-weighted inversion recovery images, and sequences for late enhancement evaluation. Contrast agent dose was 0.2 mL/kg (gadobutrol, 1.0 mmol/mL) with flow injection rate of 2.0 mL/s. BSSFP sequences were acquired in the three cardiac axis, T2-weighted and T1-weighted in transversal cardiac axis, and sequences after contrast agent in short cardiac axis covering the entire left ventricle. The exam showed concordance in atrial-ventricular and ventricular-artery communication, regular return of superior vena cava and pulmonary veins. Left ventricle normal for volume, thickening of posterior wall with multiple mitral accessory ropes. Regular contractile functionality (ejection fraction of 71%).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 128.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 128.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 128.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 128.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 128.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 11.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 11.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 11.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 128.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 11.0 mEq/L) = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 18.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 18.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 18.0 - 12 = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 6.0 mEq/L.",

She received antithymocyte globulin induction immunosuppression at a total dose of 6 mg/kg body weight, 3 plasmapheresis sessions, and IVIG at total dose of 2 g/kg, as well as maintenance therapy with tacrolimus, everolimus, and prednisone, progressing without complications until hospital discharge.\nAbout one year after KTx, she was admitted to the hospital with dry cough, low fever, hyporexia, asthenia, and polyarthralgia for 1 month; she had lost approximately 6 kilos in this period. Previous examinations revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia (). She was then hospitalized for evaluation, diagnosis, and clinical support.\nAt admission, the patient was feverish, tachypneic, tachycardic, and pale. She had lung auscultation crackles in the lower right third and abdomen dullness to percussion over Traube’s space. Antibiotic therapy was started with levofloxacin after evaluation and suspected diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Admission examinations revealed persistence of bicytopenia, in addition to hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Renal function was preserved. Total abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of homogeneous splenomegaly. The patient followed with progressive clinical worsening (persistence of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension). Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and later with meropenem was scaled-up due to unsatisfactory clinical response. Given the cytopenia, a myelogram was performed two weeks after admission, which revealed hypercellularity and hematopoiesis, increased macrophage activity, and bone marrow with reactive characteristics (). HLH secondary to an unknown infectious process was diagnosed. Mycoculture was negative. Concomitantly, increasing levels of galactomannan in blood led to the initiation of antifungal therapy with voriconazole for aspergillosis. Therefore, IVIG at 2 g/kg body weight, divided into 3 doses, was initiated combined with the specific therapy, and immunosuppression was reduced (suspension of everolimus and maintenance of tacrolimus and prednisone).\nAfter these measures, the patient clinical status improved significantly, with reduction of inflammatory markers and gradual improvement of hematological dysfunction ().\nHowever, after 40 days of hospitalization, the patient had a massive pulmonary aspiration, clinical worsening, and death one week after the event. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 59 year old man who had undergone left total knee replacement in November 2008 in another institution presented with a 5 month history of left knee pain and persistent swelling. He complained of a restriction in the range of movement and morning stiffness. The pain was at the front of the knee and medially more than laterally. It was worse with stairs, getting up from a chair, kneeling, squatting, getting into and out of a car and exercising. Sitting, medication and icing made the pain better.\nClinical examination revealed that the patient was 71 inches tall and weighed 285 pounds. There was a marked effusion in the left knee. It was slightly warm but there was no redness. The knee had a 10 degree fixed flexion contracture and could bend to 100 degrees. There was no instability in the antero-posterior or medio-lateral directions. The neurological and vascular examinations in the extremity were normal.\nPast medical history included a successful right total knee replacement in 2007, spinal surgery in 1989, adrenalectomy in 2011 and prostate surgery in 2010. He also had a history of hypertension, prior hepatitis and dyslipidemia\nRadiographs showed an increase in patellofemoral joint space suggesting a marked effusion in the left knee and asymmetric medial joint space narrowing. There was the suggestion of internal rotation of the tibial component and periprosthetic lucency was noted in the posterior aspect of the medial and lateral tibial plateau, consistent with polyethylene wear and particle disease (). CT scan showed internal rotation of the tibial component and joint effusion. The patient had a posterior stabilized Triathlon TM knee (Stryker Corp, Kalamazoo, MI). Both femoral and tibial knee components were made of cobalt chrome alloy, with a polyethylene spacer.\nPre operative Complete Blood Count (CBC) was within normal limits. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was slightly raised at 28mm/hr and C reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 5.7 mg/L. Aspiration of the knee revealed cloudy fluid and gram stain, cell count with differential and cultures were negative for infection. Three phase bone scan showed increased uptake on the blood pool phase consistent with synovitis, and increased uptake in the left knee on the delayed images.\nTherefore revision knee surgery was performed. There was a florid synovitis and the polyethylene component was fractured and worn posterolaterally. There was a 2 ⨯ 3 cm area of significant metallic wear on the postero-lateral aspect of the femoral component. The metallic tibial component was also worn posterolaterally and internally rotated. It appeared that metal-on-metal wear was occurring in this area. There was an adjacent soft tissue mass which resembled a pseudotumor. The femoral component was well fixed to the bone and well positioned. However significant wear and shape change of the lateral femoral component was noted and this mandated femoral component removal. Debridement and synovectomy was performed followed by revision of the femoral and tibial components and the polyethylene insert. The patellar prosthesis was well fixed and not damaged. Therefore the original patellar component was left in place. The patient had delayed wound healing, and small areas were left to granulate in successfully. The patient had a successful post operative recovery and was mobilizing well at the 6 month follow up. The range of movement of the knee was 0 – 110 degrees and the knee was stable.\nHistology of the specimen revealed granulomatous inflammation, metallic and polyethylene wear debris, and areas of tissue necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration. () AFB and Gram staining were negative. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 68 year-old Asian woman was admitted to our hospital presenting with a two-day history of high grade fever, diarrhea and nausea. The patient's symptoms began one day after eating grilled chicken and beef at a restaurant; however, she did not complain of abdominal pain, vomiting, or hematochezia. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the age of 50, had undergone haemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy for the past 2 years, and was under three times weekly haemodialysis. She had also undergone an aortic mechanical valve replacement operation for aortic stenosis 7 months prior to the current admission.\nUpon admission to our hospital, the patient's height was 149 cm and her body weight were 61.0 kg (dry weight). The patient's temperature was 106°F, blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, heart rate was 152/min, and respiratory rate was 24/min. Cardiovascular examination revealed a Levine IV/VI systolic murmur at the right second intercostal space. Her bowel movements were slightly hypoactive and physical examination did not reveal any abdominal tenderness or rebound. No evidence of embolization including Osler node, Janeway lesion and petechiae was observed. No other abnormalities were noted on the systemic examination. Initial laboratory examinations revealed the following results: hemoglobin, 115 g/L [110-146 g/L]; total leukocyte counts, 10300/μL [3500-8200/μL] without left shift (Myelo 0.5%, Meta 0.5%, Stab 2.0%, Seg 90.0%, Lym 1.5%, Mono 5.5%); normal platelet counts, 1.42 × 103/μL [1.40-3.89 × 103/μL]; significantly elevated C-reactive protein, 18.54 mg/dL [<0.30 mg/dL]; Na 131 mEq/L, K 4.3 mEq/L, Cl 97 mEq/L, HCO3- 18.9 mmol/L; BUN 43.6 mg/dL, Cre 7.25 mg/dL (before haemodialysis); serum glucose, 173 mg/dL; and HbA1c, 7.3% [4.3-5.8%]. In addition, the patient was tested negative for HIV antibodies.\nSalmonella enteritis or campylobacter enteritis was suspected due to the history of eating grilled chicken. Treatment was initiated with ciprofloxacin 300 mg q24hr, ceftriaxone 2 g q24hr, and clindamycin 600 mg q12hr intravenously, started on day of admission. Three days post-admission, a serial blood culture taken on admission revealed Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (O9, H-g) that was sensitive to ceftriaxone (MIC <= 1) and ciprofloxacin (MIC <= 0.25) (Table ). After detection of the causable microorganism, ceftriaxone and clindamycin treatment was ceased, and the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin alone. Since the patient's aortic valve was a prosthetic, and Salmonella species have a high affinity for intravascular intima, there was a concern about prosthetic infective endocarditis. Therefore, the patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on day 7; however, no abnormalities were detected by TTE. On day 9, the patient showed a sudden disturbance in mental status, left conjugate deviation, and right hemiplegia. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain via MRI showed an acute cerebral infarction of the middle cerebral artery region (figure ). Following this discovery, the TTE was re-examined, followed by a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on day 13. The TEE revealed floppy vegetation on the mitral valve, which was 12 × 8 mm in size (figure ). We could not find any aberrance of the replaced aortic valve. Although surgery to remove the vegetation was considered, acute cerebral infarction contraindicated her from undergoing the operation. The ciprofloxacin dose was increased to 400 mg q24hr and was combined with ceftriaxone 2q q12hr, on day 12. Consequently, the patient was treated solely with ciprofloxacin for 8-day period (from day 4 to day 11). Although the patient's neurological deficit ameliorated gradually, she experienced another infarction at the left occipital lobe and the right cerebellar hemisphere on day 18. Conservative therapy with antibiotics was continued; however, her mental status progressively decreased and blood pressure deteriorated. Blood culture examinations were repeated, but they were all negative. haemodialysis ceased on day 35 due to the unstable haemodynamic status, although treatment with ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were continued. On day 39, the patient died of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Her clinical course is shown in figure . Autopsy revealed a rigid node on the mitral valve (figure ), associated with septic emboli (mass of gram-negative microorganisms) at the left occipital lobe (figure ). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

The patient had been previously admitted to the hospital a month prior to this presentation with similar complaints and was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis with an epidural abscess. Blood cultures obtained on the prior admission grew Gram positive cocci in clusters, later identified as S. marcescens. The patient was treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, after which his sepsis resolved, and he was discharged shortly after. Presumably, in the time between the two admissions, the patient had had valve replacement surgery performed, as he presented with a sternotomy scar and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram performed on this admission revealed bioprosthetic aortic and tricuspid valves as seen in Video . On the current presentation, the patient’s mentation was altered so no history could be gathered at the time of admission. On presentation, the patient was febrile, body temperature 101.8°F, blood pressure (BP) 11/64 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 110 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 25/min, and his O2 saturation was 95% on room air. The complete blood count (CBC) revealed hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.2 g/dL (12-16 g/dL) with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 77.9, white blood cell (WBC) count 3.6 (4.8-10.8) with absolute neutrophils of 2.8 (1.4-6.5) and platelet count 18k (130-400k).\nThe basic metabolic panel (BMP) revealed blood glucose 99 mg/dL (74-118 mg/dL), creatinine 1.04 mg/dL (0.4-1.0 mg/dL), sodium 125 mmol/L (136-146 mmol/L), potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.6-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 95 mmol/L (101-111 mmol/L), bicarbonate 21 mmol/L (22-32 mmol/L), magnesium 1.0 mg/dL (1.8-2.5 mg/dL), and phosphorus 1.6 mg/dL (2.4-4.7 mg/dL). Lactic acid was 1.2 mmol/L (0.5-2.2 mmol/L). Radiology was insignificant, as a chest X-ray revealed sternal sutures consistent with open heart and valve replacement surgery but showed no acute cardiopulmonary events. CT studies of the head and cervical spine were negative for acute, strokes, bleeds, or fractures as well.\nThe patient was bloused with 3 L of lactated Ringer in the ED, as code sepsis was called, and he was given STAT doses of vancomycin and zosyn for broad spectrum coverage. Blood and urine cultures were drawn for culture and sensitivity studies. The patient was started on standing doses of antibiotics and was admitted for further management. Unfortunately, the patient’s serum sodium dropped rapidly to 121 mmol/L, likely secondary to massive IV fluid transfusion, his serum osmolarity at the time was 260 mOsm/kg (280-295 mOsm/kg) and his urine osmolarity was 611 mOsm/kg; he was started on normal saline intravenous fluids (IVF), and was upgraded to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring and correction of his electrolytes. The patient gradually regained consciousness, and his serum sodium improved to 127 in the span of eight hours, so the IV fluids were discontinued, and he was fluid restricted to prevent over-correction. Shortly after the patient became fully oriented, he opted to sign out of the hospital against medical advice. The risks were explained to the patient regarding the critical nature of his condition, but he decided to leave and not continue his hospital course.\nA few hours later, the patient was again brought by the EMS after being found once again unconscious on the highway. His previous management was continued as mentioned before, and he regained consciousness shortly after admission. His condition improved in terms of body temperature, BP, and HR. Blood cultures obtained revealed Gram positive bacteremia, so his antibiotic regimen was narrowed to vancomycin alone. The patient then reported that he was on methadone treatment for heroine dependence and withdrawal and expressed the wish to be continued on it. A few hours later, the patient again wanted to leave the hospital against medical advice, and he was again counseled on the severity of his condition and the importance of completing his antibiotic regimen and hospital course, but he was adamant about leaving and left the hospital before the complete resolution of his symptoms.\nCase #2\nThe patient was a 51-year-old Hispanic female with past medical history of hypertension, depression, chronic hepatitis C, and IV substance abuse who was brought to emergency room by ambulance with chief complaint of severe acute low back pain. Low back pain was started three days before her presentation. It was constant, radiating to legs, worsened with movement, with no alleviating factor, associated with malaise. The patient was actively using IV heroin and had previous history of heroin overdose. Her last heroin injection was two to three days before admission, around the same time that the pain started. Upon admission, the patient denied fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, numbness, tingling, and weakness of the lower extremities.\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was remarkable for disorientation, 3/6 systolic murmur, in addition to opiate withdrawal sings. Labs were significant for sodium 129 (136-144 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 30 (8-20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.5 (0.4-1.0 mg/dL), WBC 19.3 (4.8-10.8 k/uL) with neutrophil predominance, platelet 71 (130-400 K). Urinalysis was also positive for large blood and leuko esterase. MRI of spine showed degenerative changes but no concrete evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis. Trans thoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Trans esophageal echocardiogram showed moderate sized (1.6 cm x 2 cm) vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve of high embolic potential and ischemic cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle as seen in Video . CT of the abdomen showed multiple splenic and renal infarcts as seen in Figures -. The patient was started on empirical treatment with vancomycin and cefepime after first sets of blood culture was done. Blood cultures turned to be positive for S. marcescens and later antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone based on the sensitivity results.\nDuring hospital course, the patient’s mental status was further deteriorated. Severe tachypnea and respiratory distress resulted in intubation and mechanical ventilation of the patient in the ICU. Brain MRI showed multiple foci of acute non-hemorrhagic infarcts secondary to cardioembolic disease.\nAntibiotic therapy was continued for the patient and second sets of blood culture were negative. The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon. She was not a candidate for surgery intervention, due to unstable medical condition and multiple brain and myocardium infarcts. Hospitalization was further complicated by pneumonia with positive respiratory culture for S. marcescens and later Clostridium difficile infection. Due to multiple failed weaning trials, tracheostomy was placed for the patient. After two months of hospitalization, the patient was transferred to long-term acute care hospital.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 125.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 9.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 9.0 mEq/L.",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 51 years old. The patient's is a Male. The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult male's the total body water percentage value is 0.60.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points. The patient is 62 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0. Because the patient does not have confusion, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the score at 0. The concentration of BUN is 28.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1. The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 150 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 79 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg.

In addition, he had xanthomas on the elbows, soles of the feet, and Achilles tendons () and a family history of CAD, since his father died from acute myocardial infarction (the patient was unable to inform the occurrence of CAD in other family members). The patient had no other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus and was physically active. The patient's LDL-C and HDL-C levels were 545 and 53 mg/dL, respectively. His fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (85 and 158 mg/dL, resp.) were within normal limits.\nThe patient reported no use of lipid-lowering medication until the time of diagnosis. For socioeconomic reasons and/or lack of instruction, he had not sought medical care until when his symptoms eventually made him unable to work in the field. However, no symptoms of CAD were revealed.\nNeck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur 3+/6+ in the neck, radiating to the skull. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, stress testing, Holter monitoring, and echocardiography revealed no abnormalities. Visual examination of the aortic root and aortic valve revealed no signs of their involvement (). On ultrasonography of the carotid arteries, we observed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA), with stenosis estimated between 70% and 90% (according to the criteria established by the European Carotid Surgery Trial and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, as well as Dopplervelocimetric data) and moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) estimated between 40% and 50% ().

Physical examination was remarkable for pallor, systolic murmur along the aortic area. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, and no organomegally was detected. Examination of the extremities showed multiple healed wounds along both the lower extremities without evidence of infection. His right ankle was swollen and mildly tender to palpation with no erythema or warmth.

Two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Later his blood culture grew streptococcus G. Given the newly discovered heart murmur, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained and showed a medium sized, 1.0 cm (length) × 1.0 cm (width), irregular, partially calcified, mobile mass on the left ventricular aspect with appearance consistent with vegetation. Subsequently, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and confirmed aortic valve vegetation (). No other obvious source for bacteremia was identified. Patient underwent right ankle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was negative for osteomyelitis or septic arthritis or abscess. Given the patient’s severe microcytic anemia, iron studies were obtained and confirmed severe iron deficiency anemia. He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during his hospital stay. His low hemoglobin prompted further workup including computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis which revealed circumferentially thickened segment of descending colon adjacent to the splenic flexure with localized invasion into the sigmoid colon. Such finding was highly suspicious for primary colonic cancer. CT of the chest showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring 1.6 cm most compatible with metastatic disease. Colonoscopy showed a friable lesion that was partially occluding the lumen and biopsy of the lesion confirmed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (, ).

She had a history of decompressive craniectomy due to cerebral swelling and right middle cerebral artery infarction 1 year prior, and sequela included persistent weakness of her left side. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction, 63%) and no regional wall motion abnormalities. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were performed as usual, and routine cardiac anesthesia monitoring was conducted. The mitral valve replacement was a 27-mm St. Jude Medical valve prosthesis (St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA), and the Maze operation proceeded well under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Myocardial protection was performed via an infusion of cold cardioplegia via the aortic root cannula. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed no paravalvular leakage. Immediately after an aortic cross clamp, the cardiac activity was converted to normal sinus rhythm but returned to atrial fibrillation after a few minutes. Left ventricular systolic function remained normal. The patient was weaned from the CPB. After the operation, the patient was transferred to the ICU. The patient’s vital signs were controlled through administration of dobutamine and norepinephrine, and tachycardia was controlled through amiodarone. The patient’s blood pressure was maintained at 110/60 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was greater than 97%. Extubation was performed the day after the operation. However, at 2 days postoperatively, the patient complained of dyspnea and chest discomfort, and electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a premature ventricular complex. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction to 26% and akinesia of the middle and apical wall of the left ventricle (). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected, but coronary artery disease could not be completely ruled out. On the 4th postoperative day, the patient developed pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. The patient’s systolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg, and heart rate was 150 beats/min. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were continuously increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a continuously worsening ejection fraction. The patient was intubated, and we decided to perform ECMO insertion because coronary angiography and management were not possible at the time due to the patient’s condition. The results of laboratory tests were as follows: creatine kinase-MB, 1.5 μg/L; troponin I, 1.73 ng/ml; and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 4,073 pg/ml. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with ST and T wave abnormality. The QT interval was 266 ms. Vasopressor support with norepinephrine was continued. Coronary angiography was performed under ECMO, and the results were normal. Thus, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed, and conservative treatment and supportive care were maintained. At 11 days postoperatively, the ECG showed QT prolongation (582 ms). At 21 days postoperatively, transthoracic echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had recovered to 38%, and the ECMO was subsequently removed. Extubation was performed at 30 days postoperatively, and the patient was transferred to the general ward at 33 days postoperatively. At 35 days postoperatively, the patient’s left ventricular ejection fraction had recovered to 58%. The changes in BNP and serum troponin I levels are shown in .\nThe patient was discharged on the 60th postoperative day after receiving rehabilitation for left-sided weakness.

The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.

Based on his complaints and abnormal chest X-ray, he was treated with ciprofloxacin for pneumonia. However, his symptoms were nonetheless becoming progressively worse. In addition, he began to have dizziness and worsening shortness of breath with minimal exertion. He reported three separate occasions of briefly losing consciousness after exertion, from which he awoke abruptly. A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed at an outside institution revealed a left atrial mass.\nOn examination, he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg and a regular pulse rate of 81 beats per minute. Room air oxygen saturation was 93%. There were no signs of distress; the lungs were clear; no murmur or friction was audible over the heart. There were no overt signs of heart failure.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in the anterior precordial leads. Chest X-ray showed vascular congestion and small bilateral effusions blunting the costophrenic angles consistent with congestive heart failure. Laboratory findings included normocytic anaemia with haemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL (normal 14–18), a thrombocytosis of 524 000/UL (normal 150 000–500 000), and normal white cell count. Serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL (normal 0.7–1.2), troponin I level was 0.24 ng/mL (normal <0.04), and B-type natriuretic peptide level was 1340 pg/mL (normal <100).\nAs shown in Figure , a transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed a large (3.4 cm × 4.5 cm) lobulated mass in the left atrium adherent to the intra-atrial septum, and another smaller mass in the right atrium, both highly suggestive for atrial myxoma. However, as seen in Figure (arrows) the mass consisted of multiple echo-lucent areas compatible with cystic elements inside the tumour. During diastole, the mass prolapsed from the left atrium into the mitral valve orifice creating severe functional mitral stenosis with a mean gradient of 11.6 mmHg across the mitral valve (, Video S1). Left ventricular ejection fraction was mildly reduced (45%).\nThe patient was promptly referred to cardiothoracic surgery, and he was hospitalized for an emergent surgery. Upon his admission, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation. Preoperative coronary angiography revealed a 60% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery which was found to be haemodynamically significant by fractional flow reserve (FFR).\nThe patient underwent robotic-assisted surgical excision of the atrial masses. After a standard median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was obtained, and the left atrium was approached. The mass was close to the mitral valve but arising from the superior and medial aspects of the atrial septum with a broad base, so wide excision of the atrial septum was necessary to excise the tumour. Once the left atrial mass was removed, the right atrium was opened, and another separate mass was noted, occupying the entire septum anteriorly all the way to the orifice of the coronary sinus. This second mass also required a wide excision afterwards the intra-atrial septum and the right atrial wall had to be reconstructed using bovine pericardium patches. A single coronary artery bypass grafting to the LAD was performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\nOn gross pathology, the excised tumours measured 4.5 and 4.0 cm, had a smooth and multilobulated surface with a white colour and gelatinous texture (Figure A). Microscopically, the tumours consisted mostly of conventional myxoma histology, characterized by classic stellate and fusiform myxoma cells in myxoid stroma (Figure ). A significant amount of each tumour volume (∼20%) showed evidence of glandular differentiation that manifest through formation of small and large cystic glandular elements measuring up to 1.4 cm (Figure and C). The content of the glands was mucin which was confirmed using special studies. No cytologic atypia or mitotic activity was found.\nThe post-operative period was uneventful. The atrial fibrillation resolved spontaneously. On post-operative echocardiography, the left atrium appeared normal, and there was no obstruction of mitral inflow. There was no transit of agitated saline bubbles across the septum. The patient was discharged home on the 10th post-operative day. Two-months post-operatively, the patient was feeling well. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Two years prior, he was diagnosed with monoclonal IgM kappa MGUS and BM biopsy revealed B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation (10% of the marrow cellularity). The differential diagnosis at this time included LPL and marginal zone lymphoma. Given that he was asymptomatic at this time, he was monitored without treatment.\nIn the Emergency Department (ED), his vital signs were a pulse of 88 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 145/62, and temperature was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit. His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air and he was mildly tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. At physical examination, he appeared well, he was well nourished, awake, and in no apparent distress. An ear, nose, mouth and throat examination showed clear nasal mucosa and normal mouth mucosa. His head was atraumatic/normocephalic. His heart rate was normal, with a regular rhythm, heart sounds were S1, S2, and there were no murmurs, rubs or gallops. There were rales in his left lung base without wheeze or rhonchi. His abdomen was soft, non-distended, and non-tender. His lumbar spine showed a mild reduction in range of motion. He showed superficial bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was alert and oriented × 4, with no focal deficits, and no motor or sensory deficits. His CN II-XII were intact, extremities showed no cyanosis or edema, and his skin was dry, intact, with no rash. Our patient was given one ipratropium bromide/albuterol nebulizer treatment and two doses of morphine 1 mg for back pain. During the admission, our patient received tramadol 50 mg once for back pain and required no other medication. His complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 6.2 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, platelet count of 156 × 109/L with normal differential.

To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 18.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 95.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 141.0 + (18.0 / 2.8) + (18.0 / 18) = 293.706 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 293.706 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 293.706 mOsm/kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 45-year-old man (height: 174 cm, weight: 82 kg) with no relevant medical history or known substance abuse had been working in a chemical plant producing and storing monochloroacetic acid for almost 20 years. The containers and pipes used for production, use, storage, and transportation of monochloroacetic acid in the factory are made of corrosion-resistant materials. However, they had not been inspected and maintained for a long time. On 17 October 2019, at 10 am, a glass tube ruptured as 80 % monochloroacetic acid, heated to 60 °C, was being delivered under pressure. The liquid sprayed the patient’s chest, left armpit, and right wrist. Although he immediately took off the clothes, redness, swelling, and the sensation of burning appeared in the affected area of the skin. The patient rinsed the acid off with water for 15 min and dried the skin with a towel. He then reported the accident and waited for assistance at his workplace. He complained of monochloroacetic acid mist and smell in the workshop and inhaled some of the vapours of the acid. Shortly thereafter, pain appeared in the area that previously was in contact with monochloroacetic acid, and dyspnoea and irritating dry cough developed. The patient was rushed to the local hospital in an ambulance, and during the ride, the skin was washed with a 4 % solution of sodium bicarbonate. Despite this treatment, the skin continued to show redness, ulceration, and blisters, and some areas turned dark brown. He arrived at the hospital approximately 2.5 h after the accident, and emergency debridement of necrotic areas was performed immediately. Shortly after, the patient developed lethargy, dyspnoea, and hypoxemia and was transferred to the Qilu Hospital for treatment the following day (18 October 2019). Upon admission, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP) 152/104 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 90 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 13 breaths/min, body temperature 37 °C, and oxygen saturation 95 % (with oxygen treatment at the rate of 5 L/min). The patient was conscious, lethargic, and developed dry heaving and blurred vision. Crepitations were audible over the lung base bilaterally. Heart rhythm was normal, the abdomen was flat and soft, and no abnormality was apparent. shows the laboratory findings on admission to the Qilu Hospital.\nAfter administration of anti-tetanus immunoglobulin, the wound () was treated again by repeated rinsing with iodophor and saline and covering with antibacterial dressing. An intravenous infusion was initiated to maintain water-electrolyte balance and provide antibiotic treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and moxifloxacin. The patient also received daily intravenous infusions of 200 mg methylprednisolone as pulse therapy. Considering the large area of the burn and the long time during which monochloroacetic acid was absorbed, bedside continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) was applied every other day to rapidly remove acid from the circulation and prevent acute renal failure. Patient’s lethargy gradually improved, and the level of consciousness returned to normal on the third day of treatment. The wound dressing was changed daily, and the patient did not have severe acidosis, oliguria, or anuria. However, he developed a cough with purulent yellow sputum and his temperature rose to 38.8 °C but dropped to normal after the administration of antibiotics. Six days after the admission (on 24 October), the patient’s condition was relatively stable, and laboratory tests improved (). Wheezing, coughing, and expectoration continued, however. shows the head, abdomen, and chest scan () revealed cerebellar infarction, a few ischemic degeneration foci in the brain, a few inflammation areas in both lungs, fibrous foci, a small amount of effusion in bilateral pleural cavity, and adjacent pulmonary tissue swelling, indicating monochloroacetic acid aspiration pneumonia. The patient therefore continued to receive antibiotics and started a regular terbutaline atomisation therapy to help expel the phlegm, and the patient was encouraged to cough out the sputum.\nThe patient remained stable until 5 November (see blood test findings in ). Methylprednisolone was discontinued and replaced with oral prednisone, which was gradually reduced. Given the stable condition of the patient, the burn department was contacted to arrange skin grafting. The patient was diagnosed with a 10 % third-degree burn. On 18 November, he underwent debridement and negative pressure suction of the upper limbs and left chest wall under general anaesthesia. Granulation and stale tissue on the wound surface were removed. Skin grafting was performed under general anaesthesia by rinsing the wound with hydrogen peroxide and sterile saline, and implanting the patient’s left anterior thigh full-thickness flap into the left upper limb and the left side of the chest wall. The wound healed perfectly (), and the patient was discharged on 4 December 2019. The results of the tests performed during a follow-up visit on 29 April 2020 were within the normal range. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 24-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department of our hospital with a sudden episode of nausea, vomiting and collapse, having become acutely unwell whilst at work. There was no past medical history and she was not taking any regular medication. On examination she was of normal body weight (weight 53 kg and body mass index 21 kg/m2), afebrile and her blood pressure was 103/56 with no postural change measured. Although she appeared drowsy and unwell, her systemic examination was unremarkable and no focal abnormalities were found on neurological examination of the central or peripheral nervous system. Initial biochemical analysis revealed sodium 127 mmol/l, potassium 3.2 mmol/l, urea 3.8 mmol/l, creatinine 77 and glucose 4.1 mmol/l. Inflammatory markers (white cell count and C-reactive protein) were normal. A computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain demonstrated normal ventricles, no focal lesion or mass effect and normal sagittal sinus flow. Upon lumbar puncture, performed in the lateral decubitus position, an opening pressure of 40 mm of water was documented. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy revealed two white blood cells (WBCs) per mm3, <1 red blood cell (RBC) per mm3 and no organisms. CSF chemistry was unremarkable: protein 0.4 g/l and glucose 3.2 mmol/l. The patient had remained drowsy and she was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with a presumptive diagnosis of acute meningoencephalitis with a secondary syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). No measurements of serum or urine osmolality were made. She was treated with antibiotics and acyclovir and was also supported with intravenous fluids and, within 24 hours, had improved such that she was transferred back to the ward.\nDuring subsequent review she admitted to several months of generalised fatigue, sometimes falling asleep at work, and of intermittent headaches. With subsequent neurology specialist input to review the grossly elevated intracranial pressure, accompanied by normal imaging and CSF analysis, the patient was commenced on acetazolamide 250 mg daily for presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Visual acuity and visual field (Goldman perimetry) testing was unremarkable. On endocrine review, generalised hyperpigmentation with facial melasma were noted and, although she had no buccal pigmentation, she did have marked pigmentation of a recent scar over her left shoulder (Figure ). A short synacthen (250 mcg) test (SST) was performed and demonstrated adrenal insufficiency with basal cortisol at 231 nmol/l, 30 minute cortisol 265 nmol/l and 60 minute at 200 nmol/l. A repeat SST showed basal cortisol at 138 nmol/l and 30 minute cortisol at 159 nmol/l and confirmed adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal antibodies were negative. Her plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was raised at >278 pmol/l consistent with primary adrenal failure. She was commenced on glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone 10 mg bd) and mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone 50 mcg) replacement therapy and discharged. On subsequent review two weeks later, she was feeling much better with CSF pressure reduced to 25 mm of water on repeat lumbar puncture. Acetazolamide was discontinued after three months and on subsequent reviews at six and 12 months, she continued to remain well on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 127.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 127.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 127.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 127.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 127.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 127.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 4.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 4.1 mmol. To convert 4.1 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.1 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.721 g glucose. To convert 0.721 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.721 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 721.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 721.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 72.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 4.1 mmol glucose/L converts to 72.1 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 127.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (72.1 - 100) = 126.33 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 126.33 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 66-year-old man was admitted to our internal medicine department for recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin. He denied oral antihyperglycemic agents. He had no known drug allergies, he was a former smoker, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98%, while he was breathing ambient air. The patient's body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 (height: 173 cm; weight: 80 kg), and the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission showed glucose 50 mg/dl, HbA1c 50 mmol/mol, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.8%, and mean corpuscular volume 85 fl), a normal white cell and platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 87 IU/L (normal range: 17–59), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 62 IU/l (normal range: 21–72), gamma glutamyl-transferase 545 IU/l (normal range: 15–73), alkaline phosphatase 177 IU/l (normal range: 38–126), total bilirubin 0.47 mg/dL (normal range: 0.20–1.30), lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L (normal range: 313–618), albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal range: 3.6–5.5), INR 1.18, C-reactive protein 7.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0-1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h (normal range: 0–15), fibrinogen 621 mg/dl (normal range: 170–410), iron 37 μg/dl (normal range: 49–181), and ferritin 776 ng/ml (normal range: 20–325). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative.\nFurther blood tests were ordered to rule out endogenous hyperinsulinism: C-peptide was 4.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0.5–3), insulin 89 μIU/mL (normal range: 5–25), while the patient's glucose level was 40 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screening test was negative, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. Markers of neuroendocrine tumors were severely increased: chromogranin A (CgA) was 1790 ng/ml (normal range: 0–100), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was 458 ng/ml (normal range: 0–11).\nGiven the high suspicion of insulinoma and the altered liver function tests on admission, a full-body CT scan was ordered. CT scan showed a 4.3 × 2.2 cm pancreatic tail mass containing calcifications with multiple regional lymphadenopathies (). Multiple liver secondary lesions were found: the largest ones measuring 12 and 11 cm, respectively, in II-III and IVb-V segments. No lungs, bone, and brain metastases were detected. Additionally, a thyroid nodule of 2.6 cm was incidentally found. Hepatic metastases were highly suspected to be secondary to a malignant insulinoma, so ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies of the lesion in the II-III segments were performed (). Histological findings of four core biopsies consisted of hepatocytes infiltrated by a poorly differentiated and focally necrotic proliferating tissue of medium-sized atypical epithelial cells with solid growth pattern (). The cancer cells showed hyperchromatic nuclei with “salt and pepper” chromatin markedly Ki-67 positive, high mitotic index (10 figures × 10 HPF), and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the neuroendocrine nature and the partial insulin secreting activity of the lesion; CgA, synaptophysin, CD56, and CAM5.2 were diffusely positive; there was patchy (<5%) insulin expression. Ki-67 index was 40–50. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic, poorly differentiated (G3), neuroendocrine carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype favoring a pancreatic primary tumor. Thyroid ultrasound () showed a weakly hypoechoic solid nodule (2.8 × 3.2 × 1.3 cm) with a central cystic component and regular margins located in the isthmus and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.6 cm) adjacent to the lower pole of the left lobe. Calcifications and intranodular flow were absent in both nodules, and regional lymph nodes were not enlarged. The results of thyroid function tests were within normal limits (TSH 0.7 mUI/L, normal range: 0.46–4.68), as well as were parathormone (PTH) (80.1 pg/mL, normal range: 13.6–85.8), calcium (8.76 mg/dL, normal range: 8.4–10.2), and phosphorus (4.32 mg/dL, normal range: 2.5–4.5). Serum calcitonin was slightly raised (30 pg/mL, normal range: 0–6), but immunohistochemical staining of the liver lesions was negative for such markers.\nThe patient's hospital stay was characterized by different episodes of severe hypoglycemia (as low as 18 mg/dL) occurring especially at night and in the early morning, manifesting only with diaphoresis. During those episodes, the patient never lost consciousness or developed seizures and even never complained of confusion, amnesia, weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, palpitations, or hunger. In order to reduce the hypoglycemic events, we started a symptomatic treatment with diazoxide and IV infusion of 10% dextrose, while waiting for histopathological confirmation of the disease. Unfortunately, due to the severity of this malignancy, after 8 days of treatment edema, hypotension, oliguria, and weight gain of 10 kg were observed; the patient's clinical status deteriorated rapidly, and 3 days later, the patient died from acute renal failure.

    "Lower Limit": "10.45",
    "Upper Limit": "11.55",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 145.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 145.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 23.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 23.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 23.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 23.0 - 12 = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 11.0 mEq/L.",

He had no other underlying disease but had a known large epiglottic cyst, which resulted in intubation failure and the cessation of surgery at a previous hospital. Laryngoscopic examination revealed a bulge arising from the center of the epiglottis and stretching to the glottis. It covered most of the epiglottis and occupied most of the pharyngeal space (). Despite the large size (> 2 cm) of this epiglottic cyst, the patient did not complain of any laryngeal symptoms such as dyspnea, dysphagia, hoarseness, and sleep apnea. A preoperative evaluation by an otolaryngologist concluded that the patient be kept under close observation as he did not show any symptoms. Preoperative airway assessment demonstrated excellent mouth opening and that the jaw could be thrust forward, corresponding to a class 1 Mallampati score. His temporomandibular joint activity, neck movement and thyromental distance were also normal.\nThe patient was informed at the preoperative visit about the likelihood of a difficult intubation, the procedures involved with an awake intubation, and the necessity for his cooperation with this procedure. In the operation room, we decided to perform an awake orotracheal intubation using CVS loaded with a left 37 Fr DLT (). The patient was premedicated intravenously with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate, and 50 µg fentanyl. A superior laryngeal nerve block with 2 ml of 2% lidocaine was performed bilaterally and 10% lidocaine spray was applied to the oropharyngeal mucosal surface with direct laryngoscopic exploration. Preoxygenation was performed using a closed facemask with 100% oxygen delivery at 8 L/min over 10 minutes. The CVS loaded with a lubricated 37 Fr DLT was smoothly inserted into the posterior pharynx. After identifying the epiglottis and glottis opening, the distal tip of the CVS was carefully advanced below the mass to the glottis aperture (). The DLT was further advanced until the tracheal cuff passed through the vocal cord. After endotracheal intubation was confirmed by auscultation of the bilateral breath sound and end-tidal CO2 detection, the patient was given propofol 140 mg and vecuronium bromide 10 mg intravenously.\nThe time taken to complete awake intubation was less than 1 minute. Spontaneous breathing was maintained and no desaturation occurred during the entire procedure. General anesthesia was maintained with a 2-3 vol% of sevoflurane with 50% oxygen and medical air mixture. After the position change for VATS, the final position of the DLT was confirmed by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) (Olympus LF-DP; Olympus optical Inc., Tokyo, Japan). At the completion of VATS, the patient's position was changed to supine and the PPPD preceded without an endotracheal tube change. Although the DLT is a larger tube with the potential to cause more airway trauma or edema postoperatively, we decided not to change the tube because this would have caused an even higher risk to the patient from possible cyst damage or intubation failure.\nAfter these surgical procedures were completed, the patient was fully awakened and extubated. The patient was then transferred to the general ward via a recovery room with no respiratory or hemodynamic complications. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He was diagnosed with chronic HCV (3a genotype) infection in 2003. The patient’s medical history was not significant except for dental surgery and few surgical stitches. He remained treatment naïve for 5 years. In 2007, he received the first IFN (100 mg/week) plus RBV (400 mg/day) combination therapy and was on this treatment for 6 months. However, SVR was not achieved. He remained without treatment for the next 2 years (2008–2009). In 2010, he again underwent the same combination therapy. After 6 months of treatment, he, remained positive for HCV RNA. These treatments were not only expensive but also resulted in adverse effects, including stomach burning, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, fatigue, and anxiety.\nIn 2011, Patient was advised to undergo PEG-IFN plus RBV combination therapy. However, he remained a non-responder. After one and a half year, in 2013, patient received the same (PEG-IFN plus RBV) combination therapy for 6 months. Yet patient’s serum was still positive for HCV RNA. Eventually, in 2015, he underwent SOF (400 mg/day) plus RBV combination therapy for 6 months. Still SVR was not achieved and surprisingly a high viral load of 5.2 × 105 IU/ml was reported by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis. An ultrasound revealed that his liver was of normal shape, size, and echotexture; he had a mildly fatty liver with no fibrosis or lesion.\nThe patient’s diagnostic and treatment history are summarized in Tables and , respectively. Viral genotype remained undetermined/untypable for the years 2012, 2014, and early 2016 (Table ) following 6 months of combination therapy (Table ), perhaps due to the detection method’s incapability or the detection limit as it was performed on conventional PCR-based method followed by detection on the agarose gel. In late 2016, the viral load was found to be 5.2 × 105 IU/ml and the patient was found positive for genotype 3a (Table ).\nAfter partial genome sequencing of NS5B, BLAST analysis showed 93% similarity to the already existing NS5B nucleotide sequences in the GenBank database (Fig. ). This shows virus (accession number KY971494; variant ‘Pk1-RV’) is of genotype 3a. Analysis further confirmed that the variant (Pk1-RV) is distinct from HCV genotypes 3 k, 3b, 1a, and 1b (Fig. ).\nTaking into account the medical history of the patient, we performed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for interleukin 28B (IL28B) at rs8099917 and rs12979860. The present study showed polymorphism cytosine and thymine (CT) and guanine and thymine (GT) at (rs12978960, (rs8099917) respectively, as in (Fig. ).

Pre-operative evaluation revealed grade III motor weakness of both hands, but there was no other underlying disease or abnormal laboratory findings. Since it was not an elective surgery, the anesthesiologists did not have sufficient patient information, particularly regarding the airway. Preoxygenation, induction was performed using 250 mg pentothal sodium, 7 mg vecuronium, and sevoflurane. When we opened his mouth, the opening was barely 4 cm wide and his neck was extremely stiff. In addition, we could not verify the airway anatomy when we lifted his tongue via direct laryngoscopy. Therefore, we decided to use a combination of an ILMA and a FOB immediately. Furthermore, since the operation had to be conducted with the patient in the prone position, we required the establishment of a more definite airway than an ILMA. After placing the ILMA, a FOB was introduced through with ease and an ETT was then advanced along the FOB into the trachea. Sufficient insertion was confirmed by easy bag ventilation and a capnogram, followed by administration of dexamethasone 5 mg to prevent laryngeal edema.\nIt was unnecessary to prepare for invasive airway access in these three cases that included surgical or percutaneous airway, jet ventilation, and retrograde intubation because facemask ventilation was adequate and a definite airway was created through an ILMA.

She was hospitalized in another province for these complaints. The presenting complaints were diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and continuous fever from the last three days with vomiting and constipation for the last two days. The vital signs were BP 133/97 mmHg, RR 20/m, PR 136/m, temperature 39 C0, and SpO2 90%. On physical examination, the patient looked ill with a distended abdomen, generalized tenderness, rebound tenderness, and guarding. Fluid thrill and shifting dullness was positive. Bowel sounds were not audible on auscultation. Blood workup showed TLC 21,000/mm3 (normal 4000–11,000), neutrophil 89% (normal 40–75), Hb 8.2 g/dl (normal 11.5–16.5), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dl (normal 0.6–1.2), total bilirubin 0.71 mg/dl (normal 0.1–1.2), SGOT 20 IU/ml (normal 0–40), SGPT 34 U/L (normal 5–40), alkaline phosphatase 109 IU/L (normal 40–240), and blood group AB + ; the HbsAg, anti HCV Ab, and HIV were negative. She was initially received by the emergency doctor and was diagnosed with “postpartum sepsis” because she was having signs and symptoms of sepsis. Ultrasound showed distended bowl loops floating in free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Erect chest X-ray showed no air under the right hemidiaphragm. CT with contrast was performed revealing gross ascites suggesting peritonitis but the cause of the ascites was unclear.\nAn exploratory laparotomy was performed after initial management with a hollow viscous perforation in mind. Biliary peritonitis was found with about 4 L of bile-stained fluid in the peritoneal cavity; the stomach, small intestine (distended), and colon were normal. A perforation of about 7–8 mm was found on anterolateral wall of supra duodenal segment of CBD below the junction of cystic duct and common hepatic duct as shown in Fig. . Gall bladder and the rest of biliary tree was normal without any calculus. An intra-operative cholangiogram was not available so a 10 French feeding tube was passed to the duodenum through a perforation to confirm the distal obstruction that passed without any resistance. Peritoneal lavage with warm normal saline, cholecystectomy, and CBD repair over a T-tube was thus performed. The post-operative stay was uneventful, and the patient fully recovered and was discharged on the 7th post-operative day.

There was no family history of liver disease, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. Since birth, her general health had been good; however, hepatomegaly was noticed during a routine health care visit and therefore, at 5 years of age, the patient was referred to our hospital. At that time, her height was 100.6 cm (-2.0 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) and her weight was 14.1 kg (-1.8 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) (BMI= 14.1 kg/m2). A physical examination revealed hepatomegaly with moderate elevation of serum transaminases. Jaundice and splenomegaly were absent. She was admitted for further evaluation . Laboratory findings revealed liver dysfunction and hypercholesterolemia (AST 211 IU/L, ALT 321 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 914 IU/L , alkaline phosphatase 971 IU/L, leucine aminopeptidase 272 IU/L, ?-glutamyl transpeptidase 10 IU/L, total cholesterol 207 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL, triglyceride 142 mg/dL, and total bile acid 5.5 mg/L). Serum anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-DNA antibody were negative. Her fasting blood glucose was 91 mg/dL and within the normal range. Glucosuria was detected; however, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed normal glucose levels and insulin responses (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatomegaly with diffuse low density and no mass, suggesting fatty liver change. Ultrasonography and CT demonstrated no abnormalities in other organs. It was suspected that the patient had some degree of liver disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Biopsy specimens showed vacuolar degeneration of individual hepatocytes and macrovesicular steatosis (). Hepatitis, drug-induced disease, and congenital metabolic diseases were excluded, and the origin of the liver disease remained unknown. As the cause of liver disease was not determined, we treated the patient for hypercholesterolemia with ethyl icosapentate, which is not hepatotoxic (). Post-treatment, her serum cholesterol level had decreased to almost within the normal range. Regarding hepatic dysfunction, the patient’s serum transaminase levels were reduced but continued to fluctuate at the upper end of the normal range. A CT scan showed improvement of fatty change in the liver. When the patients was 9 years of age, it was noticed during a routine laboratory evaluation that she had elevated HbA1c (7.3%) and she was reevaluated for diabetes. At this time, her height was 127.4 cm and her body weight was 25.7 kg (these measurements correspond to -1.0 SD for a normal Japanese girl). BMI was calculated as 15.9 kg/m2. The second OGTT showed reductions in both glucose tolerance and insulinogenic index (). The peak level of serum C-peptide after glucagon stimulation remained normal (3.9 ng/mL, normal range >2.0 ng/mL). Islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody were not detected in the serum. At this time, she was suspected to have MODY3 because of liver disease and negative auto-antibodies. It has been reported that sulphonylureas are effective in the treatment of patients with MODY3 (); however, the use of sulphonylureas in children is not approved by the health insurance authorities in Japan. Since the patient had a reduced insulinogenic index, insulin treatment in a total daily dose of 9 units prior to each meal was initiated. Since that time, the patient’s diabetes has been under good control and her liver dysfunction has been normalized. She is now 20 years old, and her total daily insulin requirement has increased to 36 units, while her HbA1c levels range from 6.5% to 7%. We could not obtain patient and parental consent for a second biopsy.\nBecause the clinical course led to a probable diagnosis of MODY, we analyzed HNF1A, 4A and -1B by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing, according to a previous report (). Sequence analysis of HNF1A identified a heterozygous mutation at the consensus splice donor site of intron 9, which has been previously reported in a MODY3 family (). Neither of the patient’s parents had this base change, indicating that the mutation occurred de novo. However, we could not perform an analysis of somatic mutations of HNF1A in liver tissue, which was previously biopsied, because we did not have access to the samples. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

The diarrhea was not accompanied by abdominal pain before or after a bowel movement. The patient had lost 30 kg of weight (from 100 kg to 70 kg) in the 3 months since the diarrhea had begun. Before visiting our hospital, he had been admitted to two other hospitals, where he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominopelvic CT scan, but none of the studies revealed the cause of his chronic diarrhea.\nHe was taking antihypertensives (amlodipine 5 mg/day, olmesartan 20 mg/day, and atenolol 50 mg/day) and an oral hypoglycemic drug (glimepiride 2 mg/day.) Twelve years previously, he had suffered from jaundice with intrahepatic stones and undergone removal of the stones via percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy three times. He had also undergone open cholecystectomy for empyema of the gallbladder 8 years previously. He had a 40-pack-year history of smoking but had stopped smoking 12 years previously.\nHe looked ill. His body height was 172 cm, and his weight was 71 kg (BMI 24 kg/m2).

A blood chemistry test revealed that levels of BUN/Cr, albumin, AST/ALT, ALP, amylase/lipase, and CRP were 12/0.99 mg/dL, 2.9 g/dL, 14/10 IU/L, 77 IU/L, 58/27 U/L, and 0.25 mg/dL, respectively. Electrolyte levels were within the normal ranges (sodium 135 mEq/L and potassium 4.1 mEq/L). Glycated hemoglobin level was 5.5%. A qualitative test of urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid showed a negative result. The patient was in a euthyroid state (thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.6 µU/mL and free T4 1.1 ng/dL). The fecal occult blood test (immune latex agglutination method) result was negative. A routine stool examination showed no helminth ova, protozoa cysts, or trophozoites, and a stool Gram stain showed no leukocytes. There was no growth of Shigella, Salmonella, or Yersinia species on the stool culture. A Clostridium difficile toxin assay and culture showed a negative result.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy did not detect any abnormal findings in the esophagus; however, multiple erosions and whitish scar changes were observed in the gastric body and antrum. Mucosal nodularity was observed in the second portion of the duodenum. Colonoscopy did not detect any abnormalities except one small polyp in the cecum and one in the rectum. Biopsy specimens were randomly obtained at each segment of the entire colon and the terminal ileum. A small bowel series showed no abnormal findings.\nHistological examination of the stomach revealed a moderate mixed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the lamina propria. Duodenal biopsy showed chronic severe duodenitis with mucin depletion and flattening of the villi. Mild lymphocytic infiltrations were observed in the ileal and colonic biopsies of each segment of the entire colon.\nThe patient was treated empirically with antiparasitic drugs (400 mg of albendazole once and 1.8 g of praziquantel 3 times per day for 2 days) and antidiarrheal drugs (loperamide, which was initially started with a dose of 3 mg/day and later escalated to 9 mg/day; 1 g of a compound of bismuth, tannalbin, and kaolin 3 times per day; and 10 mg of codeine 3 times per day); however, the diarrhea continued. The patient received octreotide (0.05 mg subcutaneously 3 times per day), which was unable to relieve his symptom.\nBecause the cause of the diarrhea was still unclear after thorough evaluation, a second esophagogastroduodenoscopy was conducted. This time the endoscopy was advanced farther beyond the second portion of the duodenum, with the purpose of examining the proximal small bowel as far as possible. Mucosal changes indicative of metaplasia were detected from the second portion of the duodenum to the proximal jejunum. However, the most distal small bowel that could be observed during the endoscopy appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were randomly obtained from the duodenal bulb to the proximal jejunum (). Duodenal biopsy revealed blunting of the intestinal villi, detachment of surface epithelial cells, depletion of goblet cells, and moderate lymphoplasmacytic and mild eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and crypts. Increased mast cell infiltrations into the lamina propria with more than 50 mast cells per high power field were observed by toluidine blue staining and CD117 (KIT) immunohistochemical staining (). Jejunal biopsies demonstrated similar histological features.\nTreatment with hydroxyzine (10 mg per day), famotidine (20 mg per day), and ranitidine (300 mg per day) was started soon after confirmation of gastrointestinal mastocytosis. The patient returned to the outpatient clinic 2 weeks later, and his symptoms of chronic diarrhea were substantially improved.

The functional class was III [(New York Heart Association (NYHA)] and drug therapy was according to the III Brazilian Guideline on Heart Failure and II Brazilian Guideline on Atrial Fibrillation: Losartan 100 mg, Furosemide 40 mg, Carvedilol 150 mg, Warfarin 5 mg, Simvastatin 20 mg, Metformin 1700 mg, and Omeprazole 20 mg. Because of a long history of AF, rate control strategy was implemented. The patient did not have a history of neuromuscular or pulmonary disease. He never smoke and did not drink alcohol. According to his level of physical activity, he led a sedentary life, defined as self-reported less than 1 day/week of planned, structured, and repetitive exercise. His body mass index was 36.8 kg/m2 and resting blood pressure was 115/80 mmHg. Resting electrocardiogram showed AF with an average heart rate of 75 b.p.m.\nThe supervised exercise training program was carried out three times a week, for a period of 12 weeks in a closed environment, with a controlled temperature between 21°C and 24°C in the afternoon (3:30 pm to 4:30 pm). The exercise training protocol consisted of 5 min of warm-up exercises, 30 min of aerobic training performed on a cycle ergometer at 60 rpm, 20 min of resistance exercises with lower and upper limbs and 5 min of relaxation exercises. The workload was adjusted during the stimulus phase of the aerobic training to keep the perceived effort intensity between 11 (relatively easy) and 13 (slightly tiring) of the Borg Scale. Resistance training was performed in a weight training station and consisted of 2 sets of 10 repetitions, and the following sequence of exercises: leg extension, leg curl, lat pull-down, peck deck, and press chest. The initial workload was set at 60% of 1 repetition maximum. He was encouraged to complete the sets of 10 prescribed repetitions, performing the appropriate movement and avoiding Valsalva manoeuvre. He was instructed to rest for 30–60 s between sets. The intensity of the exercise was increased from 5% to 10% whenever the patient adapted to the exercise workload thorough the 12 weeks of training.\nAfter 12 weeks of supervised sessions, the patient became asymptomatic (NYHA I) and was instructed to continue exercising at home.\ndisplays the results of the cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after 12 weeks of exercise training, performed on a cycle ergometer, using the modified Balke protocol (25 w/min).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 57 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.

The initial blood pressure in her right arm was 220/100 mmHg, and her respiration rate was 40 breaths per minute. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, a prominent aortic notch, and pulmonary edema, which explained her tachypnea and arterial hypoxemia (). The laboratory data was as follows: creatine kinase-MB, 1.20 ng/mL; troponin I, 0.08 ng/mL; brain natriuretic peptide, 5,850 pg/mL; creatinine, 1.3 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 12.30 mg/L; and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 1.1 mm/hr. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a Q wave on V1, ST segment elevation from V1 to V3, and T wave inversion on anterior precordial and inferior limb leads. Echocardiography showed akinesia of the anterior wall anteroseptum, and inferoseptum from the low middle left ventricle to the apex with thinning and a preserved ejection fraction of 50% with left ventricular hypertrophy. The medical history taken from the patient’s family revealed that she had been diagnosed with hypertension, Takayasu’s arteritis, and cerebral infarction at another hospital fifteen years ago. In addition, an aortic bypass graft procedure carried out to treat thoracic aortic stenosis 15 years ago. When the patient presented to an emergency room of Gachon University Gil Medical Center she had left hemiparesis as the sequel of her previous stroke.\nComputed tomography revealed severe stenosis in the descending thoracic aorta and diffuse circumferential wall calcifications (). Wall thickening was also observed in the distal portion of the aortic arch and in the left common carotid artery. Between the proximal descending thoracic aorta and supraceliac abdominal aorta, there was a bypass graft, which had a 3-cm pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis and severe luminal stenosis at its proximal segment.\nEndovascular repair was performed to treat the pseudoaneurysm and graft stenosis simultaneously. Under general anesthesia, the descending aorta was accessed via a right common femoral artery puncture. After the narrowed proximal portion of the graft was dilated with a 12×4 cm balloon catheter (Ultrathin; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a tapered stent graft (proximal diameter 32 mm, distal diameter 24 mm, length 10 cm; Seal, S&G Biotech Co., Seongnam, Korea) was implanted from the proximal descending aorta into the bypass graft. The bare stent portion of the stent graft was deployed proximally to the left subclavian artery. To relieve the stenosis at the middle portion of the graft, a bare metal stent 28 mm in diameter and 8 cm in length (Hercules; S&G Biotech Co.) was implanted. The absence of a pressure gradient between the stent graft and the distal native aorta was confirmed before the catheter and sheath were removed.\nThe patient was extubated three days after the endovascular stent graft procedure. Postoperative computed tomography showed good stent graft patency in the descending thoracic aorta and that the pseudoaneurysm was thrombosed ().\nThe patient was discharged uneventfully with no pressure difference between the right arm and the legs. She showed no complications for three years after the stent graft procedure, and a follow-up computed tomography scan showed that the graft was patent and that the size of the pseudoaneurysm remained unchanged. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

The infant presented with a history of poor oral intake and breathing difficulty of 1-week duration. There was no history of fever and no clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic infection. He was treated initially with tablet diltiazem (1 mg/kg/dose eight hourly) and subsequently with amiodarone infusion (up to 15 mcg/kg/min) with no response. At the time of admission to our unit, the heart rate was 200/min, with low-volume pulses and mean blood pressure of 40 mmHg. There were palpable congestive hepatomegaly and LV S3 with a gallop. Chest X-ray showed a Cardio-Thoracic ratio of 0.65 and pulmonary venous congestion. Echocardiography revealed a severe LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [EF]: 30%). Electrocardiography showed a ventricular rate of 200/min, relatively narrow QRS complexes with right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology, right axis deviation, and Ventriculo-Atrial (V-A) Dissociation suggestive of fascicular VT []. A diagnosis of tachycardiomyopathy due to incessant fascicular VT was made. He was started on inotropic support and diuretics. Electrical cardioversion was tried multiple times with a dose of 2 J/kg without any success. Intravenous verapamil with a dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg followed by 5 mcg/kg/min and xylocard were tried without any response. In view of incessant VT unresponsive to drugs and cardioversion, radiofrequency ablation was planned. After taking informed consent from the parents, ablation was successfully performed with no further recurrence of VT. Infant improved symptomatically, and EF normalized after ablation and discharged in a stable condition. The child has not had a recurrence at 2 years of follow-up and is off medications.\nThe child was brought into the electrophysiology laboratory in incessant VT, with RBBB morphology, left superior, and relatively narrow QRS with VA dissociation []. The procedure was done under controlled general anesthesia. Vascular access was obtained through the right femoral vein and artery and the right internal jugular vein. Catheters were placed in the coronary sinus, His bundle region and single catheter in right ventricle (RV) & Right atrium (not shown in figure). Heparin bolus of 100u/kg was administered, and activated clotting time (ACT) was maintained consistently over 300 s with repetitive heparin boluses.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient gave written informed consent for publication of this case report and any accompanying images, and the presentation was approved by the institutional review board of Juntendo University (JHS 18-027).\nA 67-year-old male, 170 cm tall, weighing 72 kg, was scheduled to undergo left lower lung lobectomy via open thoracotomy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. He had no relevant medical history, and his preoperative blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. We decided to preoperatively insert a thoracic epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia.\nOn the day of surgery, no premedication was administered. He was monitored by ECG, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry. Before general anesthesia induction, the patient was positioned in the right lateral position for catheter insertion. We initially attempted the epidural puncture at the thoracic (Th) 6–7 interspace, which we changed to the Th 5–6 interspace after 15 min due to difficulty in an epidural puncture at the original site. Using a right paramedian approach, an 18 G Tuohy needle (Perican® epidural needle, 18G × 80 mm, B. Braun, Hessen, Germany) was used for epidural puncture 1 cm caudal and 1 cm to the right of the spinous process. After confirming accurate placement of the needle tip in the epidural space by the loss of resistance to injection of normal saline, the epidural catheter (Perifix® epidural catheter, standard 1000 mm, B. Braun) was inserted via the Th 5–6 intervertebral space with no resistance. The final total insertion length was 13 cm: 6 cm through the skin and 7 cm placed in the epidural space. After the catheter was appropriately secured in place, the patient was turned to the supine position in preparation for general anesthesia. Before general anesthesia induction, we gave a test dose of 2 ml of 2% plain lidocaine via the epidural catheter, followed by administration of 50 μg fentanyl and 4 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine. We were able to confirm the loss of cold sensation around the left T5 area 5 min after local anesthetic administration. After induction of general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube was performed to enable single lung ventilation during surgery.\nAt the beginning of surgery, an approximately 12- cm posterolateral incision was made at the level of the fifth to sixth intercostal space. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, suggesting the adequacy of analgesia in the incision area. However, when the surgeon opened the thoracic cavity, he saw the epidural catheter below the fifth rib. The catheter seemed to follow the course of the intercostal nerve. The tip of the catheter could be seen 3 cm from the dorsal edge of the incision (Fig. a, b).\nFortunately, the catheter had not been severed during the surgical procedure. After discussion with the surgical team, we decided to withdraw the catheter via the skin of his back under direct observation by the surgeon in the surgical field. The catheter was successfully withdrawn and examined for intactness of the tip. Thereafter, intraoperative analgesia was achieved mainly by continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil and intermittent administration of fentanyl. For postoperative analgesia, a continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg (20 ml) fentanyl and 20 ml normal saline was administered as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) at the rate of 1 ml/h, with bolus doses of 1 ml and a lockout time of 10 min, the infusion being commenced in the latter half of surgery. The scheduled surgery was completed uneventfully without any complications.\nWe also performed TPVB under ultrasound guidance, injecting 20 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine in the paravertebral space, besides the Th5 transverse process, before the patient’s emergence from general anesthesia and while he was still in the lateral position.\nAnesthesia emergence and his subsequent recovery from anesthesia were uneventful. During the postoperative period, his numerical rating scale score ranged from 0 to 1 and he required a single administration of supplemental analgesic (15 mg pentazocine) and six IV PCA boluses within 24 h. He did not complain of any paresthesia around the intercostal region.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points. The patient is 48 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0. Whether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 0. The concentration of BUN is 22.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1. The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 154 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 93 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 1. The patient's Curb-65 score is 1.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 69-year-old male with underlying hypertension was admitted with a complaint of general weakness started 10 days ago. The patient had been taking irbesartan 150 mg and thiazide 12.5 mg for 3 years. He had 20 pack-year history of smoking. The initial blood pressure was 128/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the temperature was 36℃. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breathing sound on the left upper area of chest wall.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 8,190×109/L; hemoglobin, 16.4 g/dL; platelet count, 170×109/L; glucose level, 235 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 1.7 mEq/L; chloride, 88 mEq/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 863 U/L; D-dimer, 0.08 µg/L; and C-reactive peptide, 2.30 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.574, pCO2 50.1 mm Hg, pO2 122 mmHg, HCO3 40 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was 98.8% suggesting metabolic alkalosis.\nThe chest radiography taken on admission showed left upper lobe atelectasis and mass like lesion infiltrating the left upper bronchus (). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed about 7×5-cm-sized mass in left upper lobe showing invasion to the main pulmonary arterial trunk (). Biopsy was done with bronchoscopy and the pathology confirmed small cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography CT showed hepatic and both adrenal gland metastases.\nOur primary impression was hyperaldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism according to the lab finding of hypokalemia associated with hypertension. Aldosterone and renin level being normal, hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis in patient with lung cancer infiltrating left upper lobe suggested Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secreting tumor. The ACTH level was elevated to 535.61 pg/mL and the cortisol level was elevated to 47.43 µg/dL. The level of cortisol was not suppressed with low dose and high dose dexamethasone suppression test and the 24-hour urinary free cortisol was still elevated to 1,796.93 µg/day. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary gland and no cerebral metastases. The malignant tissue obtained with bronchoscopy was positive in ACTH marker stain. These finding were consistent with Cushing syndrome caused by ectopic ACTH production (). The patient had no cushingoid appearance such as moon face, skin change or central obesity, and hypokalemia was the only clinical feature to suspect diagnosis.\nTo reduce the high cortisol level before chemotherapy, ketoconazole (400 mg two times a day) and spironolactone were administered for EAS. As hypokalemia resolved, so did the metabolic alkalosis. It was not needed to maintain corticosteroid treatment after normalization of hypokalemia. Once ectopic ACTH production controlled, the patient was transferred to the oncology division to have systemic chemotherapy and survived for 15 months. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",

    "Upper Limit": "-0.0594",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 88.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 40.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 40.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 40.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 40.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 40.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 40.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (88.0 mEq/L + 40.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 13.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 13.0 - 12 = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 1.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 1.0 mEq/L / -16.0 mEq/L = -0.0625. The patient's delta ratio is -0.0625.",

She had been taking warfarin as prescribed by the cardiovascular surgery department for deep vein thrombosis of the right leg.\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 148/96 mmHg, heart rate 114 beats/min, respiratory rate 26 breaths/min, and temperature 37.8°C. Laboratory studies revealed: white blood cell (WBC) count, 17200/uL (neutrophil-segment 89.1%); hemoglobin, 7.6 gm/dL; platelet count, 455000/uL; NT-proBNP, 6776 pg/mL; PT, 143s (INR >10); blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 33 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.77 mg/dL; Na 131 mmol/L; K 2.5, mmol/L; Ca 8.4 mg/dL; Mg, 2.4 mg/dL; and albumin 1.7 g/dL.

The elevated PT and INR suggested warfarin overdose. We prescribed VitK1 1 ample per-12h and transfused frozen fresh plasma 12 units per-day. Three days later, the PT was normalized, 21s (INR2.0).\nAs admitted, her chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema and blunting of the left costophrenic angle (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 70%, dilatation of the left atrium, right ventricle, and ascending aorta, moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation, mild pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valve regurgitation, and pericardial effusion; no valvular stenosis problem was identified. Chest CT was performed in consideration of an organic lesion, such as a pulmonary embolism or malignancy. A large bulging pouch-like lesion below the aortic arch greater than 6x6 cm in size and a fluid collection in the pericardium (relative high density) was found (Figure , ). Results were consistent with a pseudoaneurysm in the aortic arch and hemorrhage into the pericardium.\nThoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) was successfully performed by a cardiovascular surgeon one day later.

    "problem": "<Context> We present a case of a 6.8-kg, 5-month-old Hispanic girl who was brought to the emergency room for 1 day of fever, vomiting, seizures, and leftward gaze deviation. Initial computed tomography revealed a large hemorrhagic intracranial mass in the suprasellar and third ventricular region causing obstructive hydrocephalus. An emergent extraventricular drain was placed, a magnetic resonance imaging study was obtained, and the girl was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Other than left gaze preference and clonus, the result of her examination was unremarkable, with normal capillary refill and no sunken fontanels, though a full examination was limited by sedation and her hydrocephalus. On hospital day 3, the mass was surgically resected, and its pathology was consistent with stage IV glioblastoma.\nPrior to resection, she developed CDI, and a vasopressin infusion was initiated. Vasopressin was titrated to maintain urine output between 2 and 4 ml/kg/hour and was discontinued on postoperative day (POD) 1. On POD 3, she became hyponatremic with low to normal urine output, thought to be SIADH. On POD 7, she again became polyuric, but with continued hyponatremia and elevated urine sodium. She was started on sodium and fluid supplementation in the form of 0.9% NaCl, 3% NaCl, and enteral NaCl tablets to treat CSW. On POD 8, she developed brisk and dilute urine output, with serum hypernatremia, requiring reinitiation of a vasopressin infusion and temporary cessation of sodium supplementation for CDI (Fig. ). By the next day, she became hyponatremic with continued polyuria, suggestive of concurrent ongoing CSW, and sodium supplementation was resumed.\nShe fluctuated between hypo-osmolar and hyperosmolar polyuria. Trials of discontinuing vasopressin only resulted in worsened polyuria, so she remained on a vasopressin infusion. To promote renal sodium retention, fludrocortisone was started at 0.025 mg twice daily on POD 11 and increased to three times daily on POD 17 [, ]. Sodium supplementation was adjusted to maintain normonatremia. Urine output in excess of 4 ml/kg/hour was replaced with lactated Ringer solution, 0.45% NaCl, and 0.9% NaCl respective of her urine sodium content. A timeline of various fluid and sodium treatments and examples of laboratory findings that guided treatment are described in Fig. . It was presumed that the component CSW would resolve over time. Her serum sodium concentration remained generally stable, with urine output ranging from 2 to 8 ml/kg/hour. Her fluid balance was nearly even, although maintaining this balance required aggressive and frequent fluid replacement.\nOn POD 20, her urine output began increasing precipitously, reaching over 40 ml/kg/hour in the following days. Her vasopressin infusion was increased accordingly, with no effect in slowing her output (Fig. ). By this time, her acute neurosurgical issues had otherwise resolved, but she remained in the PICU for fluid management and vasopressin. Her fluid volume status was again maintained, with moist mucous membranes and flat fontanels observed on examination, though she required progressively larger fluid replacement to match her rising urine output. This pronounced polyuria, and apparent inefficacy of increased vasopressin prompted consultation with pediatric nephrology on POD 27.\nShe had previously responded well to vasopressin; she was given no known medications associated with NDI; her electrolytes other than sodium and chloride were within normal limits; and her creatinine was appropriate for her age, ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 mg/dl, ruling out most acute and congenital causes of NDI. Other causes of urinary concentration defects were therefore considered. Her total protein upon admission was normal, but her serum albumin had decreased from 3.7 mg/dl upon admission to 2.9 mg/dl. In the days prior to consultation, her hemoglobin decreased from 11.5 to 8.5 g/dl. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) became undetectable, which was thought to reflect a protein deficiency and depleted renal urea gradient (Fig. ). Prolonged increased fluid and solute intake with hypertension and daily sodium intake of 20 mEq/kg/day were also thought to exacerbate her polyuria, further depleting her osmotic gradient. As such, her fluid replacement was incrementally decreased by 2 ml/kg/hour each day, and she was started on enteral protein supplementation to restore her osmotic gradient. Within 4 days of treatment, her BUN increased, and her urine output, vasopressin needs, and fluid replacement dramatically decreased (Fig. ). Fludrocortisone was discontinued; protein supplementation was stopped by POD 31. She then exhibited a singular CDI physiology and remained only on vasopressin without need for frequent fluid replacements. She was transitioned to subcutaneous desmopressin on POD 33 and transferred to the general ward on POD 39. After hospital discharge, she remained on desmopressin long term. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Due to inability to lie on his back without any supportive devices, the head of the operating bed was raised approximately 30–40 degrees, and anesthesia was induced in the semi-recumbent position. Anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto model); rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Before tracheal intubation, preoxygenation was performed for 5 to 10 min with 100% oxygen in a face-to-face approach, with bimanual mask holding and mechanical ventilation. Although the awake intubation technique may be considered in cases of anticipated difficult intubation, the cause of difficult intubation in the present case was attributed to a kyphotic change, and not the airway itself, such as an anteriorly deviated glottis or soft tissue swelling; therefore, the authors believed that the patient’s airway could be adequately maintained using bimanual mask-holding in a face-to-face position. Initially, direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy were attempted; however, it was exceedingly difficult to visualize the vocal cords because of the patient’s semi-recumbent position, his short stature, and the relatively large bed size. Moreover, a conventional lightwand technique from the head end of the patient was also difficult to perform. Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be considered as a first choice, it was temporarily unavailable because of an insufficient number of devices and well-trained staff. As the conventional overhead approach using laryngoscopy or lightwand was difficult, an alternative face-to-face approach using a lightwand was attempted. After all lights in the operating room were turned off, the anesthetist opened the patient’s mouth while facing him, and slowly inserted the tracheal tube-launched lightwand, of which the tip was bent at an angle of 90 degrees along the base of the tongue in the midline. The bright red light at the tip of the stylet was transilluminated and positioned at the center of the neck; subsequently, the tracheal tube was gently inserted at the location of light on the neck. (Fig. ). Face-to-face lightwand intubation was successful on the first attempt, and no specific complications, such as hemodynamic instabilities, intraoral traumas, or others, were encountered. After tracheal intubation, invasive arterial blood pressure was monitored through a cannula placed in the left radial artery using a hemodynamic monitoring device (EV1000 clinical platform, Edward Lifesciences Corp., Irwin, CA, USA). The surgery lasted approximately 7 h, during which vital signs were adequately maintained. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed using sugammadex 200 mg followed by extubation in the operation room. Adequacy of respiration was confirmed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with continued monitoring. Although there was no postoperative sore throat or hoarseness of voice, there was suspicion of pulmonary congestion on chest radiography. On arterial blood gas analysis, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) while breathing room air was 64 mmHg. However, the patient was not dyspneic, and pulmonary congestion and PaO2 improved over time. On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred to the general ward without any significant problems. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The anti-streptolysin – O titer was 100 Todd unit and throat culture was negative for group A B-hemolytic streptococcus. Antinuclear antibody, anti ds DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anticardiolipine antibodies were negative. Urinalysis revealed macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria with a 24-h urinary protein excretion of 55 mg/m2/h. The fecal occult blood testing was positive. Renal ultrasonography (US) showed increased echogenicity (grade 2) in bilateral kidneys. A skin biopsy showed a leucytoclastic vasculitis and deposition of IgA. Renal doppler US was normal. Renal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to rule out PAN revealed normal results. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as having HSV with renal, skin and probable gastrointestinal tract involvement. A diagnosis of FMF was suspected because of the absence of occult blood in the stool and normal mesenteric MRA. Since there are reports of increase frequency of MEFV mutation in patients with HSV, we performed DNA analysis in our patient and found that he was compound heterozygote, carrying M694V/E148Q.\nOn the second day of hospitalization, He had periorbital and pitting pretibial edema. Respiratory examination revealed bibasilar crackles. His urine output decreased from 1.1 to 0.6 cc/kg/h and serum urea and creatine levels were increased (105 mg/dl, 3.5 mg/dl, respectively). We showed that serum urea and creatinine levels in figure . Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion (3 mm), minimal mitral regurgitation and increased inferior vena cava index and inferior vena cava collapsibility index.\nThe renal biopsy specimen consists of two portions of renal cortex and medulla. Forty glomeruli and many arteries are available for examination on multiple sections. The glomeruli are not significantly enlarged. They show variable, mostly segmental, expansion of the mesangial matrix associated with mild segmental mesangial hypercellularity. 25–30% of 40 glomeruli show crescents and/or necrotizing lesions (figure ). Another glomeruli show neutrophilic infiltration five glomeruli are available for examination by immunofluorescence. The mesangium contains peripheral membranous granular deposits of IgG (2+), IgA (3+), C3 (3+).\nOn the fifth day at hospitalization, hemodialysis was initiated for treatment of RPGN.

    "problem": "<Context> A 31-year-old Korean male patient was transferred to our hospital from a local hospital because of persistent melena of undetermined origin. Four months ago, the patient visited the hospital with complaints of chest tightness and productive cough. An X-ray film of the chest at that time showed a patch infiltration in the right lower lung field. Studies of the sputum for acid fast bacilli were negative but anti-tuberculosis medications were started under the impression of pulmonary tuberculosis. Three months later, he was admitted to the same hospital because of melena and underwent extensive work-ups including gastroscopic examination, barium studies of the colon and small bowels, and a gastric mucosa scan for Meckel’s diverticulum, but no bleeding focus was found. During the stay in that hospital, the melena improved spontaneously and he was discharged. He did fairly well until 10 days prior to this admission when recurrent melena developed. Additional studies including 99mTC-sulfur colloid scintigraphy were carried out, but no bleeding focus was found.\nOn admission, the patient appeared pale and acutely ill. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm/Hg, pulse rate 120/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and the temperature 36.5°C. The heart sound was normal without murmur. Breathing sound was decreased at the right lower lung field. No lymphadenopathy was found in the neck or axilla. No palpable abdominal mass was felt. Rectal examination revealed internal hemorrhoid and hematochezia.\nThe hemoglobin was 4.6 g/dl and the hematocrit was 14%. The white blood cell count was 6300/mm3 and the platelet 203,000/mm3. The urea nitrogen was 22.4 mg/dl, the creatinine 1.5 mg/dl, the protein 2.5 g/dl (the albumin 1.3 g/dl and the globulin 1.2 g/dl), the bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, the alkaline phosphatase 53 IU, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 10 IU, and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 10 IU. The serum sodium was 127 mEq/L and the potassium 4.1 mEq/L. Chest X-ray film revealed an ill defined dense infiltrate with air bronchogram in the right lower lung field (). Mesenteric arteriography was performed but could not find any bleeding focus. Because of severe hematochezia, the flexible sigmoidoscopy was not available. The hemorrhoid with massive bleeding was found by anoscopy. An emergency hemorrhoidectomy was carried out on the second hospital day. However, a large amount of hematochezia persisted even after the operation and signs of serious disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) follwed. On the 10th hospital day while the DIC improved, the patient complained of abdominal distension and pain. Ascites was suspected.\nAn abdominal paracentesis revealed intraabdominal bleeding. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was perfomed. On operation, multiple polypoid masses of various sizes were palpated intraluminally in the jejunum from 10 cm below the Treitz ligament to the 120 cm distally. A large perforation of the jejunum (8 cm in diameter) probably caused by necrosis of the bowel wall was found on the antemesenteric border of the jejunum 20–25 cm below the Treitz ligament. Multiple mass lesions including hematomes were also found in the mesenteric root of the small intestine. Small bowel resection and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. On section, 36 polypoid masses were scattered grossly along the full length of the resected jejunum. The largest mass was 5.0×8.0×4.0 cm in size and composed of brownish homogeneous materials. Similar materials were filled in the mesenteric arteries and veins ().\nMlicroscopically, numerous hemosiderin pigments were scattered throughout the fields. The cells in the polypoid mass lesion were consistent with large round cells of undetermined origin. Each cell had a round nucleus containing prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm was homogenous and clear (). The immunohistochemical study for S-100 protein was negative. Electron microscopically, obvious desmosomes were identified as convincing evidence of carcinoma (). Bronchoscopic examination, which was done on the 10th postoperative day, revealed an obstructing round mass at the entrance of the right main bronchus (). Histologically, this lesion was diagnosed as large cell carcinoma of the lung ().\nOn the 27th postoperative day, massive amounts of hematemesis and hematochezia developed again.

The patient was nonreactive for HIV and anti-HCV antibodies and was also hepatitis B surface antigen-negative.\nOn the second day of admission, the ultrasound of the abdomen showed an enlarged spleen, mild ascites and right-sided pleural effusion and features suggestive of pancreatitis. The plain and contrast CT scan of the whole abdomen performed on the second day of admission, showed that the pancreas were enlarged, with minimal area of necrosis seen in the tail region. Severe inflammatory changes were seen at peripancreatic fat extending into the lesser sac. There was inflammation extending into the paracolic gutters with thickening of the adjacent colonic walls, along Morrison's pouch, along both anterior pararenal spaces causing thickening of fascia of Gerota and lateroconal fascia. Inflammatory changes were also observed in the mesentery especially in the omentum []. Based on the CT scan findings of pancreatic necrosis, the patient was started on imipenem.\nThe pus from the pancreatic abscess was aspirated under CT guidance and sent for culture and sensitivity. The pus was inoculated on Blood agar, MacConkey agar, Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) with and without antibiotics and thioglycollate broth. The culture of the pus yielded growth of E. coli and C. tropicalis. The bacterial isolate was found to be susceptible to piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem. The candidal isolate was identified to be C. tropicalis by growth on cornmeal Tween 80 agar []. The Candida isolate was found to be susceptible to amphotericin B. The initial culture report was conveyed to the clinician on the third day of admission.\nBased on the preliminary culture findings the patient was continued on imipenem, and amphotericin B was added to the treatment regime, but the condition of the patient deteriorated on the fourth day of admission, for which the patient had to undergo necrosectomy of the infected pancreatic tissue. During the operation dense calcification was noted in the parieties and dense adhesion of the omentum was noted with the colon and stomach parieties and thick pus was drained from the lesser sac. The drained pus and the necrosectomy tissue sent for culture showed similar findings as that of the earlier aspirated pancreatic pus.\nAfter the operation the patient was continued on imipenem and amphotericin B to which the patient showed a marked improvement with the subsidence of fever.

The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 11.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 111.0 mg/dL.

The induction of the anesthesia was done with midazolam 1.5 mg, propofol 50 mg, remifentanil 60 µg, and rocuronium 50 mg. The anesthesia was maintained with O2 1.5 L/min, air 2.5 L/min, sevoflurane 1.5-2.0 vol% and remifentanil 0.05-0.2 µg/kg/min. The patient was mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume (TV) of 500 ml and a respiratory rate (RR) of 10 rates/min. The end tidal CO2 partial pressure (ETCO2) was 32 mmHg, and the peak airway pressure was 12 cmH2O. During the operation, the monitoring of the patient included an electrocardiography, a noninvasive and invasive blood pressure (Philips IntelliVue MP40), a pulse oxymetry, and a bispectral index.\nThe laparoscopic cholecystectomy was initiated from a transperitoneal approach. A skin incision was made under the umbilicus to insert a Veress needle and CO2 was then insufflated to create a pneumoperitoneum with an intra-abdominal pressure of 14 mmHg. During the pneumoperitoneum, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was 0.5, the TV was adjusted to 450 ml, and the RR was adjusted to maintain the ETCO2 at 30-35 mmHg. The patient was placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position with left tilting. Fifty minutes into the surgery, when the surgeon controlled the bleeding in the dissected area, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased rapidly from 130 to 70 mmHg, the heart rate (HR) increased from 90 to 140 beats/min and the ETCO2 dropped from 35 to 13 mmHg, although the peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) was maintained at 100%. Despite a prompt injection of phenylephrine 100 µg, the SBP further dropped under 50 mmHg. Subsequently, the arterial pulse wave disappeared (the SpO2 was not checked), and the cardiac rhythm was converted from sinus tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation. We asked the surgeon to stop the operation and the CO2 insufflation, and immediately initiated chest compression. At the same time, 100% O2 was supplied, and epinephrine 1 mg was injected twice intravenously. Then, defibrillation was performed using a biphasic defibrillator (150 J), and amiodarone 300 mg was injected intravenously. The cardiac rhythm reverted to a sinus rhythm, and the BP and HR were recovered at 120/80 mmHg and 140 beats/min respectively following the cardioversion. The arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that time showed pH 7.06, arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) 222 mmHg, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 71 mmHg, base excess -10.2 mmol/L, and arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) 100%. It took less than 15 minutes to achieve full recovery of the vital signs. Although the blood pressure was incidentally decreased, the SBP was maintained above 100 mmHg with a rapid intravenous fluid infusion of plasmalyte (1 L for 20 minutes) and a dopamine 10 µg/kg/min and phenylephrine 0.8 µg/kg/min infusion.\nConsidering the possibility of a middle hepatic vein injury during the gallbladder dissection and intra-operative monitoring review of the patient, we assumed a CO2 gas embolism as the underlying condition. TEE monitoring was initiated and it revealed diffuse gas bubbles in the cardiac chamber in the midesophageal right ventricle inflow-outflow view (). The midesophageal 5 chamber view provided a closer look at the gas bubbles in the left atrium, the left ventricle, and the aorta (). To prevent a cerebral embolism, we left the patient in the Trendelenburg position and aspirated the blood through a central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein which had been inserted during the CPR. Although some gas bubbles remained in the cardiac chamber, the vital sign was stable, at SpO2 100% and ETCO2 32 to 38 mmHg. The operation was resumed with open surgery for the repair of the injured vessels and the patient was maintained in the Trendelenburg position to limit the risk of a cerebral embolism. Thirty minutes after the operation was resumed, the ABGA read pH 7.35, PaO2 204 mmHg, PaCO2 42 mmHg, base excess -2.4 mmol/L, and SaO2 100%. At the same time, the amount of gas bubbles on the TEE had declined gradually, and almost no gas bubble remained in the cardiac chamber (). One hour later, the full surgical procedure was completed. After extubation, the patient could breathe spontaneously (100% O2) without any problem. However, he was eventually transported to the intensive care unit owing to disorientation as to his name and place. Although this was fully recovered within one hour, weaknesses of his left arm and leg (3/5 strength grade) appeared on his physical examination. The computed tomography, 3D angiography, and magnetic resonance image showed only a chronic cerebral cortical atrophy and chronic microvascular encephalopathy, without any acute lesion.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 26.0 mEq/L.

Plugging in 3.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 3.0 - 12 = -9.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -9.0 mEq/L.

You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.203",
    "Upper Limit": "0.225",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 22 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult female's the total body water percentage value is 0.50. The patient's weight is 60.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 60.0 * (141.0/140 - 1) = 0.214 L. The patient's free body water deficit is 0.214 L.",

He experienced severe right lower abdominal pains, was diagnosed “appendicitis,” and received “appendicectomy” 4 months before hospitalization. In the last 2 months, he suffered from more frequent fever and hematochezia, obvious weight loss (from 40 to 30 kg), and skin nodules in four limbs and buttock, which ruptured and scabbed gradually (Figure ). He was diagnosed as IBD in local hospital, receiving mesalazine and prednisone (10 mg/day) for 1 month. He had no history of other diseases and no related family history. On physical examination, his lean appearance, superficial lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly were noted.\nLaboratory tests showed severe microcytic hypochromic anemia and hypoalbuminemia, with the hemoglobin (HGB) and serum albumin of 58 g/L (110–150) and 28 g/L (35–52), respectively. The patient suffered from decreased serum total calcium of 1.93 mmol/L (2.13–2.70) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 6.8 ng/ml (8–50), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 38 mm/hour (0–15) and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 40 mg/L (0–8). His serum ferrium, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were all decreased. Fecal occult blood was positive, and no red and white blood cells were found in the stool. Salmonella typhi was positive from stool culture; Widal reaction was negative. T-SPOT.TB test (an assay used for tuberculosis diagnosis) was weakly positive; procalcitonin (PCT), G-test (a detection method for fungal infections), and antibodies to EBV and cytomegalovius were all negative. Autoantibodies related to IBD and autoimmune diseases were all negative. There were no evidence for tumor from bone marrow smear, tumor markers, and whole body diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).\nThe abdominopelvic enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated bowel wall thickening, abnormally strengthening mucosal signals, and coarse serous membranes of terminal ileum, caecum, and ascending colon. Multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, small intraabdominal effusions, and calcifications inside the liver and scrotum were also demonstrated. The previous colonoscopy showed ulcers and erosions; pathology showed chronic mucositis accompanied with exudation and necrosis. In order to identify his primary diagnosis, we performed skin biopsy and prepared to perform the second colonoscopy. Meanwhile, we continued his previous treatment and gave his symptomatic and supportive treatment.\nHowever, he suddenly suffered from perforation in ileocecus (severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, and subdiaphragmatic free air). The emergency resection and anastomosis was successful, and the resected ileocecus was sent for pathology (Figure A). Several antibiotics and related treatment were added. However, on the third day after surgery, he experienced severe abdominal pain again, and excrement was found in his abdominal cavity drainage tube. Surgeons considered the second spontaneous perforation and performed the second operation. However, no gastrointestinal perforation was found, and it is incredible that there were still intestinal substances outflowing from the abdominal cavity drainage tube after surgery. His parents refused surgical treatment further; we continued medical conservative treatment.\nThe boy died from massive intestinal hemorrhea after a week. The pathological results of intestine and skin both showed diffuse heterotypic lymphoid cells infiltration; karyorrhexis and patchy necrosis could also be seen (Figure B–E). Combined with immunohistochemical staining (cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2)+, CD3+, CD5−, CD20−, CD4−, CD8−, CD30+ most, CD56±, T-cell restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1)+, granzyme B (GrB)+, T-cell receptor αβ (TCRαβ)−, TCRγδ−, and KI-67+ >50%; Figure ) and positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for EBV-encoded early small ribonucleic acid (RNA) (EBER, Figure ) both in the intestine and skin, EBV-positive T/NK-cell LPD (tumor stage) was identified. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "8.512",
    "Upper Limit": "9.408",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL). The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 28.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 2.8 g Albmumin/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 1.93 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 1.93 mmol. To convert 1.93 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.93 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.08 g Calcium. To convert 0.08 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.08 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 80.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 80.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 8.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 1.93 mmol Calcium/L converts to 8.0 mg Calcium/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 2.8 g/dL)) + 8.0 mg/dL = 8.96 mg/dL. The patient's corrected calcium concentration 8.96 mg/dL.",

He had neither a personal nor family history of notable illness such as thrombotic diseases. One month previously, he had presented with bilateral leg edema. Two weeks before admission, he had been diagnosed with massive proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia in another clinic. His weight had increased by approximately 8 kg in 1 month.\nPhysical examination on admission revealed the following: height 168 cm, weight 61.6 kg, blood pressure 124/75 mm Hg, pulse rate 80 beats/min with a regular rhythm, and temperature 36.4°C. The lungs were clear and heart sounds were normal. Massive symmetrical leg edema was observed. There was no rash, lymphadenopathy, or joint swelling. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nUrine sediment analysis revealed 5–9 red blood cells per high power field. Urinary protein excretion was 11.8 g/24 h. Blood analysis, biochemical and serological examination showed a white blood cell count of 7.7 × 103/μl, hemoglobin 15.4 g/dl, platelet count 315 × 103/μl, total protein 3.7 g/dl, albumin 0.8 g/dl, urea nitrogen 15 mg/dl, creatinine 0.96 mg/dl, uric acid 5.8 mg/dl, total cholesterol 460 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c 5.7%, IgG 213 mg/dl, IgA 320 mg/dl, and IgM 57 mg/dl. Serum electrophoresis revealed no monoclonal peak. The third and fourth components of complement were within the normal limits. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor activity, hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus were all negative. There was a marked elevation in fibrinogen (658.9 mg/dl) and d-dimer (3.1 μg/ml), and a decrease in antithrombin III activity (66.3%). Prothrombin time, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time were all normal. A fecal occult blood test, computed tomography (CT) through the chest and abdomen, and upper endoscopy did not suggest the presence of malignancy.\nBecause our patient initially refused renal biopsy, he was empirically treated with 40 mg/day of prednisolone from the third day after admission, together with continuous intravenous infusion of heparin for prophylaxis of thrombotic complications. However, he presented no clinical improvement and then received a percutaneous renal biopsy on day 34. The specimen consisted of 18 glomeruli showing diffuse and irregular thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with deposition of IgG4, compatible to idiopathic membranous nephropathy stage II. During prednisolone treatment, he developed a gradually progressive swelling of the upper and lower left arm. Levofloxacin was administrated because phlegmon in the upper extremity was considered, but the swelling worsened. Contrast-enhanced CT on day 54 showed obstructions of the left internal jugular vein and the left subclavian vein by large thrombi (fig. ). No anatomical abnormality in the venous system was observed. The blood levels of protein C, protein S, and β2-glycoprotein I were within the normal ranges. In addition to the heparin infusion, oral warfarin was added, with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio monitoring between 2 and 3. Edema of the patient's left upper limbs gradually improved and disappeared within 1 month. After his discharge on day 98, the edema completely disappeared. A contrast CT 89 days after discharge confirmed a significant reduction of thrombi (fig. ).

He was not able to speak and communicate till now, very much sleepy and did abnormal behavior frequently.\nMother noticed changes in the skin since 4th year of age, there were multiple tiny pink nodules on the nose and malar prominences which later coalesced to form fleshy appearances. There are hyperpigmented patches on left forehead and right malar regions. Patchy hypopigmented areas were present on both front and back of the trunk.\nThere was no other member of the family suffering from the disease.\nOn examination, the child was found dull, indifferent and expressionless with an average built having weight 20 kg, height 122 cm, head circumference 52 cm and chest circumference 61 cm. There were extensive facial angiofibromatosis with butterfly distribution covering nose and spreading to cheeks (), two prominent hyperpigmented plaques were seen, one on left forehead covering a wide area () and one on right cheek. There were hypopigmented patches abundant on both sides of the trunk.\nThe child had disturbances of higher function like orientation in time and place, speech and language as well as intelligence. His cranial nerves and motor functions were normal. Other neurological and systemic examinations appeared to be normal.\nPsychiatric assessment with the help of Vineland Social Maturity Scale and Conner’s Autism Rating Scale revealed the child was suffering from autism along with severe mental retardation with intelligent score was about 25 to 30.\nC T scan of the brain showed multiple foci of Subependymal calcification looked like candle-dripping appearances; they were also present in both basal ganglia, both temporal and left parietal regions ().\nUltrasonography of kidneys and liver showed no abnormality, Echocardiography of heart revealed no rhabdomyoma of cardiac muscle.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 20.0 kg. For patient's whose weight is in between 10 kg and 20 kg, the formula for computing maintenance fluid is 40 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 10 kilograms). Hence, plugging into this formula, we get 40 mL/hr + 2 mL/kg/hr * (20.0 kg - 10 kg) = 60.0 mL/hr. Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 60.0 mL/hr.",

He was found unresponsive and drooling on the couch by a family member. The patient's family had noted drooping of the right eyelid that had started the day before the incident. No headache, head injury, chest pain, palpitation, or decreased vision was reported but it was noted that he possibly could not see well in his peripheral visual field. The emergency medical services (EMS) reported an initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 7/15 (Eye 1, Verbal 1, and Motor 5) that began to improve on the way to the hospital. According to the EMS report, the patient's vital signs were normal at the scene including a blood pressure of 118/82 mmHg, heart rate of 92 per minute, and respiratory rate of 12 per minute. His blood glucose level was at 155 mg/dL.\nHe was a smoker, using a quarter of pack of cigarettes a day. His medications included amlodipine, ipratropium nebulizer, and albuterol nebulizer. He did not use alcohol or illicit drugs.\nUpon arrival to the hospital, the patient was lethargic and had poor attention but was oriented to the time, place, and person. He denied headache, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination revealed a GCS of 14/15 and normal vital signs, including blood pressure of 115/76 mmHg, body temperature of 37°C, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, and a regular pulse rate of 83 beats per minute. Pupils were equal in size and both had normal direct and consensual responses to light. Visual acuity appeared to be reduced but full evaluation was not possible. Complete ptosis of the right eye was noted. The right eye was deviated to the right with severe limitation in supraduction, infraduction, and adduction consistent with pupil-sparing third-cranial nerve (CN III) palsy. Fourth-cranial nerve (CN IV) palsy was also present in the right side. Extraocular eye movements were intact in the left eye. Sensation was intact over the face bilaterally. There were no other abnormal findings in the physical exam. Upon the admission, the plasma sodium level was slightly depressed at 130 mEq/L but the other initial lab findings were unremarkable ().\nThe patient was admitted to the internal medicine service for a stroke workup. Noncontrast computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the head showed only age related atrophic changes with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a sellar mass, and the pituitary MRI () revealed a large pituitary mass with extension to the right cavernous sinus. Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity suggested possible hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy). Mild mass effect on the optic chiasm was noted. There were no evidence of extension of the mass beyond the lateral confines of the cavernous sinuses and no hydrocephalus or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The major intracranial flow voids were patent.\nLumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show any blood or xanthochromia. On his second hospital day, the patient developed an acute change in the mental status. He was noted to be lethargic and confused, not responding to his name, and having garbled speech. During that time, he had blood sugar of 98, blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg, and heart rate of 113 per minute. His acute confusional state resolved within an hour, but a clouding of consciousness continued to be present as was observed since admission. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiography were normal.\nBased on the ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, altered mental status, visual symptom, and confirmatory findings in the MRI, the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was established. The hormonal profile () included a low serum cortisol at baseline (1.1 mcg/dL) and low concurrent adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). Cosyntropin stimulation increased the cortisol to 11.6 mcg/dL after 60 minutes. Free thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were normal but prolactin was below the normal range. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were normal.\nAfter the blood was collected for the endocrine workup, intravenous hydrocortisone was administered with the dose of 100 mg every 8 hours for 36 hours and then transitioned to oral hydrocortisone 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg at noon. On the fourth hospital day, transnasal transsphenoidal resection of the sellar mass was performed which was successful with no complications. Two days after the surgery, the patient reported that his vision was improving. Post-op MRI showed postsurgical changes with no definite residue and no acute complication (). Histopathology exam showed pituitary gland tissue (most likely pituitary adenoma) with extensive necrosis and hemorrhage.\nOn the ophthalmologic exam 4 days after the surgery, visual acuity was 20/40 in both eyes which was at his baseline. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were normal in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopy was bilaterally unremarkable with normal optic disc appearance. Visual field by confrontation technique was full in both eyes.\nPostoperatively, the patient regained his normal mental status with no further episodes of confusion. Level of ACTH and endogenous cortisol remained low until the last follow-up, 9 months after the surgery (). The patient was found to be hypothyroid 9 months after the surgery. His testosterone level appeared to be low on 9 months, and his LH level dropped below the normal range, suggesting secondary hypogonadism. FSH and IGF-1 levels decreased to almost half while still being in the normal range (). The above-mentioned lab data indicates that the patient developed progressive hypopituitarism after the surgery. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

His comorbidities included atrial fibrillation and hypertension, but he had never suffered from significant edema or symptoms of congestive heart failure previously. He was at the skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation after a prolonged hospitalization during which he suffered from postembolization syndrome after his fourth round of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).\nOn questioning, he complained primarily of discomfort in his legs related to edema but also endorsed fatigue and progressive dyspnea on exertion. On presentation, his vital signs were within the normal limits. Physical exam was notable for moderate jugular venous distension and an expectedly irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm without audible murmurs. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and his extremities had 4+ pitting edema to the sacrum. Laboratory evaluation revealed a mildly elevated BNP of 236 pg/mL, a slightly low serum sodium of 133 mmol/L, and normal kidney function. Small bilateral effusions were seen on chest X-ray.\nThe patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography, which revealed a 6.4 × 4.3 cm mass occupying nearly the entire right atrium, and extending to the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. ). Angiography was then pursued and showed subtotal occlusion of the IVC by a mass extending from the hepatic veins into the right atrium (Fig. ). Biopsy of the cardiac mass confirmed poorly differentiated HCC. Unfortunately, the patient was not a candidate for surgical resection or chemotherapy due to his comorbidities. Palliative radiation was considered, but the patient's symptoms progressed to the point of dyspnea at rest and anasarca before it could be initiated.

Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Because vascular disease history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.

Her height was 160 cm, weight was 37.65 kg, and body mass index was 14.7 kg/m2 (weight loss) []. She complained of urinary retention 10 days after slipping and falling to the floor. Neurological examination revealed normal muscle power in her lower extremities, with decreased ankle jerk. Sensory disturbance was detected in the perineal region. Urinary retention was severe, with loss of bladder urgency. On the basis of the above findings, we diagnosed neurogenic bladder dysfunction.\nSagittal reconstructed CT revealed that the second sacral vertebral body was fractured and displaced into the sacral canal (). The sacral kyphotic angle was 107 degrees (). Axial reconstructed CT confirmed that sacral canal was narrowed by the protruding sacral vertebral body (). Sagittal and axial plane MRI revealed that sacral nerves were compressed by the angulated sacral vertebral body and lamina on T2-weighted images (Figures and ). We determined that the fracture was unstable and would subsequently become a sacral kyphotic deformity. Thus, we planned to perform decompression surgery with stabilization.\nThe first, second, and third sacral laminae were explored through a straight posterior midline approach. Laminectomy of the first, second, and third sacral laminae was performed using a burr. No hematoma was observed. The sacral nerve roots were not disrupted. We passed UHMWPE cables from the central laminectomy area to the third and fourth posterior sacral foramina using a sublaminar wire technique. We inserted bilateral S1 pedicular and S2AI screws and connected the rods. Finally, we tightened the UHMWPE cables to the rods (Figures and ).\nThe patient's perineal numbness improved immediately after surgery. One month after surgery, she was able to urinate, and, 3 months after surgery, her bladder function had completely recovered. Three months after surgery, implant infection occurred. We considered that the fracture became stabilized at that time. Thus, we removed all implants. Following the surgery, the infection was healed. One year after the surgery, she returned to normal daily life without a cane. One- and three-month postoperative follow-up sagittal reconstructed CT revealed a high-density area in the second sacral vertebral body (Figures and ). One-year postoperative follow-up sagittal reconstructed CT revealed that the second sacral vertebral body had united without any displacement ().

After complete remission was achieved, high-dose cytarabine was given as a consolidation regimen. The patient had 1 mismatched donor and underwent allo-HSCT. The conditioning regimen was busulfan + cyclophosphamide. The laboratory findings were as follows: HBsAg: (–); anti-HDV: (–); anti-HCV: (–); anti-HEV: (–); anti-HBs: 96 mIU mL–1; anti-HBe: (–); ant-HBc Ig M: (–); anti-CMV Ig M: (–); anti-EBV Ig M: (–); anti-ParvoV IgM: (–); anti-HIV: (–). Clostridium difficile toxin A was negative and genetic analysis for inv (16) was negative. Complete blood count analysis was as follows: Hb: 14.6 dL–1 (13-17 g dL–1); WBC: 8790 µL–1 (4-10×103 μL–1); platelet count: 271,000 µL–1 (150-400×103 μL–1). Biochemical findings were as follows: glucose: 69 mg dL–1 (74-106 mg dL–1); BUN: 20 mg dL–1 (7.9-21 mg dL–1); creatinine: 0.87 mg L–1 (0.66-1.09 mg L–1); Ca: 10.3 mg dL–1 (8.8-10.6 mg dL–1); ALT: 20 u L–1 (0-35 u L–1); AST: 30 u L–1 (0-31 u L–1); ALP: 83 u L–1 (30-120 u L–1); GGT: 25 (0-38); albumin: 4.9 d L–1 (3.5-5.2 g dL–1); direct/indirect bilirubin: 1.01/0.19 mg dL–1 (0.3-1.2/0-0.2 mg dL: –1); LDH: 230 u L–1 (100-245 u L–1). Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time was 12 and 40.8 s–1 (12-18 and 26-44 s–1), respectively.\nDuring the pre-transplant period the patient’s complete blood count (CBC), liver and renal function tests, coagulation tests, and other parameters were normal. No genetic aberrations or mutations were observed. Following administration of the conditioning regimen (busulphan + cyclophosphamide), the patient underwent allo-HSCT in January 2010. On the first d of transplantation teicoplanin (400 mg d–1 for the first 3 d, and then 400 mg d–1) and caspofungin (first dose 1×70 mg d–1, followed by 1×50 mg d–1) were given intravenously due to white plaques and oropharyngeal candidiasis in the patient’s mouth, and perianal erythema. On the second d of transplantation, imipenem (4×500 mg d–1) was added to the treatment due to neutropenic fever.\nOn the 14th d of the transplantation watery diarrhea occurred, along with abdominal discomfort, nausea, and fatigue. Stool examination showed no findings of bleeding, but a rare pathogen E. intestinalis was detected via immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay (), which was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as follows: stool sample was diluted with PBS and filtrated through a 50-μm filter; 2 μL of the fecal sample suspension was placed on 18-well slides and dried for 1 h; the slides were fixed with methanol dipped subsequently in acetone for 10 min at –20 °C; 20 μL of the monoclonal antibodies was added to the slides and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a humid atmosphere; the slides were washed in PBS 3 times; 20 μL of conjugate was added to the slides and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark; cover slips were mounted on glass slides with 3 drops of anti-fading fluorescence mounting medium and viewed with a fluorescence microscope equipped with the 450-nm fluorescein filter.\nImmediately after the diagnosis was confirmed, albendazole treatment was started at a dose of 2×400 mg d–1. On the fifth d of albendazole treatment (18th day of treatment) LFT results began to deteriorate. First, teicoplanin was discontinued on the 18th day of transplantation, and imipenem together with caspofungin was initiated on the 19th d. As the LFT results continued to deteriorate, albendazole was discontinued on the seventh d of albendazole treatment (). The patient was thought to have toxic hepatitis and percutaneous liver biopsy was performed for differential diagnosis. During the pre-transplant period the patient did not have liver function abnormality and abdominal ultrasonography showed no pathological findings, such as hepatosteatosis or cholestatic disorder.\nAfter the biopsy was performed on the 22nd day of transplantation, histopathological analysis of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis. Stool examination was repeated 8 d after the diagnosis and was negative. As the patient’s diarrhea resolved, the medications used to treat diarrhea were withdrawn. LFT results began to decrease immediately after the discontinuation of albendazole treatment. On the 13th d of albendazole treatment, all LFT values returned to normal ().

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L. The patient's concentration of AST is 30.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of ALT is 20.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of platelets is 271000.0 count/µL. To convert 271000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 271000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 271000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 271000000000.0/(10^9) = 271.0 billion platelet counts per liter. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (50 * 30.0)/(271.0 * sqrt(20.0)) = 1.238.

    "Upper Limit": "134.063",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 121.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 121.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 121.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 121.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 121.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 121.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 21.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 21.2 mmol. To convert 21.2 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.2 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.021 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.021 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.783 g glucose. To convert 3.783 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.783 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3783.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3783.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 378.3 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 21.2 mmol glucose/L converts to 378.3 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 121.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (378.3 - 100) = 127.679 mEq/L.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was an 87-year-old female who initially presented to her primary care provider in May 2010 complaining of increasing abdominal pain and tightness in the central abdomen for two days with associated nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her physician sent her to the emergency department for further evaluation. The patient's surgical history included an open appendectomy in 1960 and her past medical history was significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, polycythemia rubra vera, and epilepsy. Her urological history was unremarkable. According to the patient, she had similar episodes in the past few years where she felt occasional bloating and the feeling that something was protruding into her scar, but that pain usually passed within a day.\nUpon evaluation in the emergency department, the emergency medicine resident noted a “soft, midline mass, which is tender and is incompletely reducible with moderate increase in discomfort.” A healed 5 cm scar was present in the right abdomen. Bowel sounds were increased, and the mass was initially attributed to a ventral hernia causing the patient's symptoms. An acute abdominal series showed no clear signs of obstruction. A CT scan (Figures and ) of the abdomen was obtained due to her age and severity of pain and the report from the on-call radiologist noted the following.\n“The right kidney is no longer within the renal fossa as seen in 2006, but has changed position and is now anterior to the liver. There is resultant severe hydronephrosis involving the renal pelvis and proximal ureter. This abruptly changes caliber on axial image 38 and the ureter is not well seen inferior to this level. There is symmetric renal perfusion. High attenuation material is seen dependently within the dilated renal pelvis, this could reflect blood products or stone material.” Additionally, there was no diaphragmatic hernia noted.\nThe urologist on call was then called at approximately two thirty in the morning to assess the patient, and noted in the documentation the following. “A patient with what appears to be UPJ obstruction on the right side that has developed since 2006 when she had a CT scan demonstrating what looks to be a lower pole crossing the arterial vessel. She has since had progressive obstruction that has pushed her renal pelvis posteriorly and her kidney anteriorly up in front of her liver and has displaced her colon. I am concerned that a full surgical repair would require open surgery in this delicate 88 year old and would suggest that she undergo a cystoscopy and right double-J stent placement to assess how she tolerates that.” Approximately 6 weeks following the emergency department visit, a cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde pyelograms, and right double-J stent placement were performed. This ameliorated her symptoms and the stents were removed in a timely fashion.\nThe patient was seen recently in followup in June 2013 and she stated that she had an additional episode of abdominal pain similar to her presentation to the emergency department and that manual pressure on her right upper quadrant was successful in reducing the mass and relieving the pain. In followup, the right kidney was palpable but nontender. The patient was scheduled for a routine six-month followup to track her progress. Since then, she endorsed self-treating with manual manipulation of the kidney when it has been painful.\nIn November 2013, however, the patient again presented to the emergency department with the same abdominal pain. A noncontrast CT scan was performed and the patient's right kidney had now translocated across the midline to a position anterior to her left kidney with extreme hydronephrosis present (). The following day, a retrograde pyelogram () was performed showing that the right kidney had moved back to the right lower quadrant. A double-J stent was placed to reduce the hydronephrosis and subsequently her symptoms resolved.

However, taking into\naccount the risks and costs of transplantation, the patient refused allogeneic\nHSCT and opted for treatment with lower risk and minimal pain. According to\npresence of the JAK2 mutation, a targeted therapy of\nruxolitinib combined with symptomatic treatment was recommended since June 2019.\nFor the first 5 months, the therapy consisted of ruxolitinib (40 mg/day).\nHowever, there was an aggravation of leukocytosis (from 38.22 g/l to 47.82 g/l),\nwhich, combined with the JAK2 mutation, motivated a change in\ntreatment. Since 8 November 2019, Azacytidine (100 mg/day) was added to the\ntreatment protocol daily for 7 days followed by 1× every 30 days.

The results of BM and peripheral blood smears indicate\nthat the granulocyte system is actively proliferating, accounting for 59.5% of\nnuclear cells. Peripheral blood neutrophil revealed a nucleus left shift,\nincluding 7% myelocyte, 6% metagranulocyte, 12% segmented neutrocyte, and 24%\nband form neutrophilic granulocyte. Eosinophils and basophils are easy to see.\nBM pathology results revealed that BM fibrosis has progressed to grade 3. Two\nadditional gene mutations of NRAS and KRAS were found through another\nsecond-generation sequencing. And the JAK2 V617F mutations load raised to 46.2%.\nThe spleen was more swollen than before, the long diameter increased to 168mm,\nand the thickness increased to 65mm.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 5.0 kg. For patient's with weight less than 10 kg, the rule for computing maintenance fluid is to multiply their weight by 4 mL/kg/hr to get the maintenance fluids per hour. Hence, the patient's maintenance fluid is 5.0 kg * 4 mL/kg/hr = 20.0 mL/hr. Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 20.0 mL/hr.",

    "problem": "<Context> We report the case of a 65-year-old man known for hypertension, cholelithiasis, and panic disorder with no personal or family history of pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 syndrome, Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1, or Succinyl Dehydrogenase mutations. He is a past smoker who quit 5 years prior to presentation and cumulated a 20-pack-year smoking history with no history of dyslipidemia or diabetes. The patient described a two-year history of frequent episodes of flushing, diaphoresis, systolic blood pressure surges up to 200 mmHg, loss of vision, headaches, palpitations, and tremors. He also complained of more frequent episodes of presyncope up to 6 times a day in the few weeks prior to seeking medical attention. The patient denied pallor, weight loss, weakness, or abdominal pain. His blood pressure was episodically elevated with only a moderately elevated baseline blood pressure. His only antihypertensive therapy at his first visit to our Endocrinology clinic was terazosin 1 mg once daily with only partial relief of his paroxysmal symptoms.\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with panic disorder and treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy. On physical exam, the patient's weight was 92 kg, his height was 1.77 m, and his BMI was 29.4 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 168/100 mmHg; his heart rate was regular between 90 and 100 bpm. His abdominal exam, however, revealed an obese nontender abdomen with a palpable right-sided suprarenal mass of 6-7 cm diameter, which was soft and mobile.\nTwo 24h urine collections for metanephrines and catecholamines were performed (c.f. ) and confirmed hypersecretion. No plasma aldosterone or renin levels were drawn, and no Cushing syndrome screening test was performed.\nAn MRI of the adrenals (c.f. ) reported a large right adrenal mass measuring 7.6 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm with T2 hyperintensity centrally and no loss of signal in T1. It was reported as highly suspicious for pheochromocytoma with a normal left adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas and no evidence of metastasis. Of note, the patient was not known for any underlying cardiac arrhythmia and had a normal baseline electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm at 95 bpm. No echocardiogram was ordered preoperatively.\nThe patient was referred to a urologist at an academic centre. He was then seen by Endocrinology one month prior to surgery. At his first visit to our clinic, he was counselled to have a high-salt diet and oral hydration was encouraged. The dose of terazosin was increased to 1 mg po bid x 1 week and then 2 mg po bid. Chromogranin A was elevated: 274 ng/mL (N < 82 ng/mL). An MIBG Scan was ordered, but the radiotracer was unavailable.\nThe patient was closely followed up by phone every week. Terazosin was increased to 2 mg po bid and metoprolol was added and increased to a maximal dose of 25 mg tid until he demonstrated orthostatic hypotension. The patient was admitted one day prior to surgery with a well-controlled blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg.\nIn the operating room, shortly after intubation and Foley catheter insertion and prior to surgical incision, the patient's blood pressure rose to 350/180 mmHg without improvement despite intravenous phentolamine boluses. Given the inability to control the patient's labile blood pressure, a decision was made to abort the operation and transfer the patient to the intensive care unit while remaining intubated.\nIn the intensive care unit, the patient required massive doses of intravenous phentolamine, nitroprusside, and nicardipine as well as intravenous hydration, as these are the main options for management of a pheochromocytoma hypertensive crisis as per current clinical practice guidelines []. Interestingly, his blood pressure would oscillate between 60/34 and 350/186 mmHg within a matter of 2-3 minutes in a cyclical pattern (c.f. ). A nasogastric tube was inserted, and the patient was started on phenoxybenzamine per tube. After 72 hours in ICU, he was weaned off intravenous antihypertensives and sedatives and extubated.\nHe was transferred back to the surgical ward, while gradually having his blood pressure medications uptitrated to phenoxybenzamine 120 mg po bid, metoprolol 100 mg po bid, and nifedipine XL 60 mg once daily. His blood pressure was then well controlled. The patient underwent successful open right adrenalectomy three weeks later. He was hypotensive intraoperatively, requiring vasopressors. He had an uncomplicated postoperative course.\nFurther investigations in hospital during his stay included free plasma normetanephrine 14.44 nmol/L (N<1.2 nmol/L) and metanephrine 6.09 nmol/L (N< 0.48 nmol/L), a negative cerebral CT scan, and an Octreoscan showing no site of extra-adrenal uptake. An Octreoscan was performed as a surrogate functional imaging modality given the unavailability of MIBG (recommended functional imaging modality) radiotracer at our centre around the time of this patient's admission. Pathology confirmed an 8 cm right adrenal pheochromocytoma without angioinvasion, extra-adrenal extension, or necrosis.\nOne month postoperatively, the patient was seen in the Endocrinology clinic and reported feeling overall well with no documented hypertension. He stopped all antihypertensive medications and had no palpitations, diaphoresis, flushing, headaches, or other symptoms of catecholamine excess. His 24h urine metanephrines and catecholamines normalized during follow-up (c.f. ). The patient has not undergone genetic analysis during follow-up.\nUnfortunately, the patient sustained a ST-elevation myocardial infarction three months postoperatively, requiring urgent percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement. Unfortunately, he was treated at another hospital and results from his coronary angiogram were not available to authors. He survived this acute cardiac event and continues to be followed closely by Cardiology. His longstanding elevated blood pressure secondary to his pheochromocytoma and his prior smoking history were significant risk factors for his myocardial infarction. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 55-year-old male patient without a prior medical history was admitted to the emergency room of our university hospital for treatment of a severe headache and vomiting on May 12th, 2010. His vital signs included blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg, pulse rate of 88/min, respiratory rate of 24/min, and body temperature of 36.0℃. An initial head computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute extensive subarchnoid hemorrhage filling the basilar cisterns. Subsequent CT angiography showed an anterolaterally-directed ruptured aneurysm on the left mid-cranial artery bifurcation. As a result of these findings, microsurgical clipping was proposed. During the left pterional craniotomy and dural reflection, an intraoperative rupture was encountered and a rapid corticectomy with a retraction of the temporal lobe made the aneurysm clipping amenable.\nPost-operatively, the patient was stuporous and responded only to basal stimuli. On post-operative day 2, a controlled mandatory ventilation mode mechanical ventilator was applied along with intravenous sedatives. The patient's neurologic status was stationary. Around post-operative day 5, the patient's body temporal temperature elevated to 38.1℃, and the arterial oxygen saturation levels dropped to 90%. Additional laboratory examinations revealed elevated C-reactive protein (27.0 mg/dL), leukocytosis (20,990/mm3) with a high neutrophil percentage (93%) and a left-shift. A chest CT discovered diffused bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrates with pleural effusion, consistent with a diagnosis of ARDS. Following this, the patient was placed on a regimen of IV teicoplanin (200 mg every 12 h), moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 h) and meropenem (0.5 g every 12 h). On post-operative day 7, a culture of a sputum specimen was found to be positive for multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but they were not isolated later. Consequently, the administration of meropenem was changed to colistimethate sodium (160 mg every 12h). However, oxygenation deteriorated further (PaO2/FiO2 90-150 mmHg) and the patient became hemodynamically unstable despite the use of volume resuscitation and mechanical ventilation.\nDespite the previous 10 days of regimented intravenous antibiotics and inotropics, the patient's condition worsened and progressed into severe sepsis. On May 27, lab results revealed a white blood cell count of 18,400/mm3, hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, creatinine 2.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 111 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 116 IU/L, aspartate transaminase 88 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 183 IU/L, sodium 155 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, and chloride 116 mEq/L. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm/hr and C-reactive protein was 23.5 mg/L. At this point, the patient's arterial oxygen saturation levels had dropped to 86%. In response, in addition to the existing assist-controlled mechanical ventilation, the patient was treated with 2 liters of IV normal saline, dopamine (3 µg/kg/min) and dobutamine (7 µg/kg/min). On post-operative day 17, gram-positive bacilli were detected in the patient's blood cultures. Blood was drawn from peripheral veins on both arms and feet, and six isolates could be obtained from six blood cultures. Of these, isolate 100604-2 was subjected to species identification, but it could not be identified using conventional methods in the clinical microbiology laboratory, including VITEK2 (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO, USA) and Microscan (Dade-Microscan, West Sacramento, CA, USA) analyses. On post-operative day 23, it was ascertained that there was little hope of recovery and his family requested the patient be transferred to a hospital located closer to their house. As a result the patient was discharged and transferred to the requested hospital. The patient died 3 days later.\nThe isolates including the isolate 100604-2 formed translucent, flat colonies of gram-positive bacilli, and showed no hemolysis on blood agar. To identify isolate 100604-2, 16S rRNA gene analysis was performed. A portion of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the primer set fD1/rp2 []. Determined sequences (1,425 bp) were compared with the GenBank public database using the BLASTN program () and the EzTaxon public database () []. Sequences showing high similarities were retrieved from the database and were aligned using the CLUSTALX program. A phylogenetic tree was also constructed by the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap values were evaluated from 1,000 replications.\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequence (1,425 bp) of the isolate 100604-2 showed the highest similarity (99.6%) with a sequence of P. pasadenensis SAFN-007T (AY167820), followed by P. humicus PC-147T (AM411528) (98.0%), P. kobensis DSM 10249T (AB073363) (95.0%), and P. pinihumi S23T (GQ423057) (94.7%). Thus, the isolate 100604-2 was identified as P. pasadenensis. The constructed phylogenetic tree also indicated that isolate 100604-2 clustered with P. pasadenensis SAFN-007T (AY167820), which was supported strongly by bootstrap analysis ().\nIn vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) []. Isolate 100604-2 showed a low minimum inhibitory concentration for several antimicrobial agents that included ceftazidime (1 mg/L), imipenem (≤0.06 mg/L), penicillin (≤0.06 mg/L), polymyxin B (1 mg/L), vancomycin (0.12 mg/L), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (0.06/1.18 mg/L). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CURB-65 score? </Question>",

Because the patient has confusion, 1 point is added to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The concentration of BUN is 111.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient's respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2. The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 180 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 100 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg.

The patient's heart rate is 130.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5. Because the patient did not have an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient had a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 3.0. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3.0. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3.0. The patient's Well's score for pulmonary embolism is 3.0.",

He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day, and drinks socially.\nHe had no significant social and environmental history. His medication list included amlodipine, allopurinol, ferric citrate hydrate, and lansoprazole. He had no family history of cardiovascular diseases.\nHe was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 114/50 mmHg and a regular pulse rate of 61 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation was 96% on ambient air. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmur, and abdominal tenderness. His neurological examinations were unremarkable. Blood investigations showed: hemoglobin 14.0 mg/dl, white blood cells 4700/mm3, and platelets 134,000/mm3. His liver and renal function tests revealed total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 24 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 34 IU/l, blood urea nitrogen 54.2 mg/dl, and serum creatinine 11.1 mg/dL. His C-reactive protein was 0.16 mg/dl. His serum electrolyte tests were within normal limits, including calcium and inorganic phosphorus. In addition, his brain natriuretic peptide was raised at 605.1 pg/dl. His blood cultures were negative.\nA chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram suggested left ventricular hypertrophy with nonspecific ST-T wave changes (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed MAC and a highly mobile mass (8 × 6 mm) attached to the ventricular side of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (Fig. ). The echogenicity of the mass was similar to MAC. The mitral valve was mildly thickened with mild mitral stenosis. Left ventricular systolic function was normal. Cardiac computed tomography demonstrated a calcified cardiac mass in the mitral annulus with heavy MAC (Fig. ). As the mass was highly mobile, suggesting a high risk of embolization, he underwent surgical resection of the mass. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a severely calcified mitral annulus and attachment of the calcific mass to the P2 segment of the mitral valve. Surgical resection was performed successfully.\nMacroscopic findings of the resected mass showed a yellowish colored and partially calcified mass (7 mm in diameter; Fig. ). A histopathological examination revealed multiple nodular amorphous calcifications and fibrous connective tissue. There were no identifiable myxoma or malignancy cells (Fig. ). Consequently, the diagnosis of CAT was confirmed. He recovered uneventfully and was discharged without any complications.\nNo evidence of tumor recurrence was detected after the surgery, and he is doing well after 6 months of follow-up. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> An 81-year-old male with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, three myocardial infarctions, four coronary stents, and end-stage heart failure presented to an outside hospital in June 2013 for destination LVAD placement (HeartMate II, Thoratec). Prior to LVAD placement, he did not have hematuria. However, as an inpatient, he developed gross hematuria and ultimately underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Pathology revealed muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC) with squamous differentiation. Metastatic workup included a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as a bone scan, which were both unremarkable.\nAfter discharge, the patient's bladder cancer management was referred to our tertiary center, which is also an advanced heart failure referral center with considerable LVAD experience. By July 2013, he had recovered well from his LVAD placement with improved energy and exercise tolerance along with decreased dyspnea. Following a discussion of the risks and benefits, the decision was made for surgical resection with ileal conduit diversion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was considered but not pursued given the risks of thromboembolism and infection, preexisting renal insufficiency, and patient preference.\nThe patient was evaluated by anesthesia and cardiology preoperatively and cleared for surgery. He had previously been on aspirin 81 mg, but this was held for one week in preparation for surgery. The patient was bridged from warfarin to therapeutic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) for 5 days with the last dose being 24 hours prior to surgery. In August 2013, the patient was preadmitted before surgery. Per protocol, he was given antimicrobial prophylaxis, alvimopan, and heparin 5000 u subcutaneous on the morning of surgery. Preoperative hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dL, and INR was 1.3.\nAfter intubation, bilateral transversus abdominis blocks were performed for adjunctive pain control. Radical cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and ileal conduit diversion were performed without complication. Intraoperatively, 3.6 L crystalloid, 250 mL 5% albumin, and 1 unit pRBC were administered. The patient had 265 mL of urine output and 600 mL of blood loss. A Jackson-Pratt drain and ureteral stents were left in place, and the patient was extubated. Total room time was 270 minutes, and time from incision to close was 133 minutes.\nAfter surgery, the patient was admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CICU) and given subcutaneous heparin every 8 hours. Postoperative investigations noted initially stable cardiopulmonary status (chest X-ray shown in ). Complete blood counts were drawn every 8–12 hours, and INR was checked daily. On postoperative day (POD) 1, he was transferred out of the CICU on aspirin 81 mg daily but no further anticoagulation given an INR of 2.1. By POD3, the patient's hemoglobin had decreased from 9.7 g/dL immediately after surgery to 7.5 g/dL. He was given 1 u pRBC and furosemide, but the patient became hypoxic. He was transferred back to the CICU and a bumetanide drip was initiated. He received another unit of blood once stabilized, and his hemoglobin increased to 10.7 g/dL.\nThe patient's diet was advanced on POD7 after passing flatus. From POD9 to POD11, there was a slow downtrend in hemoglobin. On POD11, a CT demonstrated free fluid of mixed heterogeneity in the paracolic gutters and pelvis, consistent with organizing hematoma (). Over the next 72 hours, 4 units of pRBC and 4 units of FFP were given for anemia and an INR of 3.8. Afterwards, the patient required no further transfusions, suggesting a self-resolving bleed. He also underwent left thoracentesis for a pleural effusion with 1.8 L of straw-colored transudate removed. Despite maintained hemodynamics, the remainder of his hospitalization was prolonged due to pain (located near the surgical incision) and anticoagulation monitoring. The acute pain service was consulted on POD15 and assisted with inpatient pain management and the transition to a home analgesia regimen. Warfarin was initiated on POD13 at an INR of 1.5. On POD20, he was discharged with an INR of 2.0 and hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, stable over 6 days. Final pathology revealed T2aN0 high-grade UC with squamous differentiation, 26 negative nodes, and negative margins.\nThe patient's last follow-up was 18 months after cystectomy. Surveillance imaging showed no signs of recurrence. The patient continues to do well from a urologic and cardiac standpoint, including stable renal function (creatinine 1.4 mg/dL), satisfactory ostomy care, and appropriate activity tolerance. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

She complained of progressive dysphagia to solid food for about four months accompanied by postprandial back radiating and epigastric pain. She did not seek any medical treatment during this period. For the last four months she also experienced loss of appetite and significant weight loss (15 kg). There was no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and previous surgery. Her medical history showed only prominent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The family history was not positive for malignancies. On admission, she was 157 cm tall, weighed 45 kg and was moderately poor nourished (BMI=18 kg/m2 ). Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, except for cachexia, and pallor in conjunctivae.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a red irregular round and plate like lesion with raised borders at midesophagus (29-31 cm from dental arc, ). Furthermore another huge mass was seen beginning from the distal esophagus extending to cardia and fundus ( & ).\nThe main bulk of the tumor could be inspected in the retroversion maneuver in fundus. This mass was very fragile and bled either spontaneously and on touch. Separate biopsy samples were taken from both the above described lesions. Accordingly pathological evaluation was performed by two experienced pathologists. Sections from the esophageal lesion displayed a malignant epithelial neoplasm composed of infiltrative nests of pleomorphic squamous cells with focally preserved inter-cellular bridges and a little keratin pearls formation. The cells had atypical oval hyperchromatic to vesicular nuclei with conspicuous nucleoli and modest eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sections from the distal esophageal tumor showed infiltrative irregular medium-sized glands lined by pleomorphic columnar cells. The cells characterized by mildly hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Taking the above histological findings into account, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and well differentiated adenocarcinoma were diagnosed ( & ).\nThoraco-abdominal computed tomography showed high density pulmonary nodules in right and left upper lobes along with a large mass with necrotic areas at medial wall of gastric fundus and cardia. Abnormal laboratory findings at the time of admission included iron deficiency anemia and an increased carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) of 125 ng/ml.\nConsidering the lung metastasis and patient’s refusal for any surgical intervention, a palliative chemotherapy was offered to the patient. Palliative chemotherapy with DCF regimen (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5FU) was administered and discontinued after 4 cycles due to lack of patient’s compliance. Then she was referred to radiotherapy ward and received platinum-based chemo-radiation (5040 cGy in 28 fractions). During this period, she was on a soft diet and her symptoms relieved after each course of chemotherapy. During the treatment course an attack of pneumonia occurred, which was controlled by hospital admission and antibiotics prescription (imipenem and vancomycin). After 6 months the patient’s symptoms including pain and dysphagia were aggravated. Seven months later, EGD revealed the tumoral ulcerative lesion which diffusely extended from distal esophagus to cardia/fundus and involved lesser gastric curvature as well. The esophageal SCC did not show any prominent grow. Metastatic pulmonary nodules were unchanged on control computed tomography. Therefore she was followed up with supportive care. In June 2014, the patient is still alive after 19 months of follow-up. However, she is presented again with anorexia, deterioration in dysphagia to both liquids and solids and epigastric pain after food. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension by a private clinic in August 2013, based upon a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and she was prescribed antihypertensive drugs to treat the condition. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and losartan 50 mg daily. After 1 week, her blood pressure was still high, so the doctor changed her medication to amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and indapamide 2.5 mg per day. Five days after initiating this second regimen of drugs, she developed pretibial pitting edema, and thorough workup was done for the symptom. There were bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT). Routine blood tests revealed the following: potassium 2.2 mmol/L, plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.12 ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 16.76 ng/dL, and an aldosterone/renin ratio (PAC/PRA) >30, indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.\nFollowing her possible diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism, the patient was referred to our hospital for additional testing. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 155/111 mm Hg, height was 164.5 cm, and weight was 63.5 kg (body mass index, 23.47 kg/m2). Pretibial pitting edemas were detected, but no physical signs of Cushing syndrome were observed.\nA routine blood test at the time of admission showed the following: white blood cell 6,900/µL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet 351,000/µL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 76 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 126 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 7.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, total cholesterol 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 104 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 50 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 141 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c 5.9%. Biochemical evaluation of pheochromocytoma showed no excessive catecholamine production. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient was 12.64%, suggesting the possibility of hyperaldosteronism or hypercortisolism. PAC and PRA were 24.4 ng/dL and 0.76 ng/mL/hr, respectively, and the PAC/PRA ratio was 32.11 (). After correcting for hypokalemia, a saline loading test was performed, which revealed no suppression of the aldosterone level after saline administration, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism (the basal PAC 24.4 ng/dL increased to 27.3 ng/dL after a 2 L saline infusion). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) resulted in no suppression of cortisol levels (). Adrenal CT demonstrated two bilateral adrenal masses in each of the adrenal glands, including a 1.6-cm mass on the right and a 2-cm mass on the left adrenal gland (). An adrenal cortical scan using iodine-131-6β-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) showed focally increased radioactive uptakes in the bilateral adrenal gland areas, with a substantially higher uptake on the left side ().\nBilateral adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation () revealed inadequate right adrenal venous blood sampling (right adrenal vein cortisol level/peripheral blood cortisol level [CRt/CP] <10), whereas the cortisol concentration in the left adrenal venous blood showed successful sampling on the left side. One explanation for this difference may be that the low level of CRt was the result of suppressed cortisol secretion due to excessive cortisol secretion from the left adrenal mass. The left adrenal vein aldosterone/cortisol (ALt/CLt) ratio was lower than that of peripheral blood, implying the possibility of suppressed aldosterone secretion from this side caused by a contralateral adrenal mass which might secrete excessive aldosterone []. Four days after the first AVS, a second AVS was performed using low-dose DST but without ACTH infusion (). This time, we also measured the epinephrine levels in the both adrenal veins and peripheral blood; a large peripheral-to-adrenal gradient of epinephrine assured successful catheterization on both sides []. CLt/CP testing confirmed that the left adrenal mass was a cortisol-secreting adenoma [].\nEven though those two AVS results appeared to provide clear evidence of the lateralization of functioning adrenal masses, such an independent functioning of bilateral masses was highly suspicious. We therefore concluded that sequential adrenalectomies, rather than concurrent operations, would be beneficial for making a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, the patient agreed to do sequential operations. The first procedure was a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy of the right adrenal gland to remove the putative aldosterone-producing mass, with the goal of controlling hypertension and hypokalemia. A firm, 1.5-cm ovoid, well-circumscribed, bright yellow tumor mass lacking necrosis or hemorrhage was arising from the cortex of the adrenal gland in the pathologic specimen. Within 24 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure had fallen to 110/80 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, serum potassium normalized at 4.5 mmol/L, and PAC decreased to 3 ng/dL. These large postoperative changes strongly suggested that the right adrenal adenoma was producing excessive aldosterone. By day 3, an overnight DST continued to show no cortisol suppression, indicating persistent secretion of corticosteroid from the left adrenal mass. To limit the likelihood of subclinical Cushing syndrome progressing to overt Cushing syndrome, we opted to completely remove the left adrenal gland as a means of controlling hypercortisolism. The excised portion of the adrenal mass contained an encapsulated brown solid mass.\nThe patient began taking prednisolone 10 mg once a day for steroid replacement 1 day after the second surgery. By 2 months she had lost 5 kg of body weight. At that time, a rapid ACTH test revealed adrenal insufficiency (). At 16 months after surgery, the patient has gradually reduced her prednisolone intake to 5 mg every other day. Her blood pressure and serum potassium levels have remained within normal ranges, without the need for additional antihypertensive medications or potassium supplements. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He was referred to the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery due to increasing intensity of chest pain as time goes by. The patient was a current smoker, who had undergone pulmonary tuberculosis with administration of beta blocking agent, calcium channel blocker (CCB), and acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) on admission. Preoperative coronary angiogram (CAG) showed a 90% stenosis on the distal left main coronary artery, which bifurcating to left anterior descending branch and left circumflex branch (). Operation was conducted under general endotracheal anesthesia, and the left internal thoracic artery (ITA) was harvested (in situ) through median sternotomy. The left ITA was anastomosed with the radial artery to form a composite Y-graft and then cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was started. Bypass grafting to the left anterior descending artery and to the obtuse marginal branch was done by using composite Y-graft. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit after uneventful weaning from the CPB following a satisfactory operation. Blood pressure and pulse rate were stable as 100/60 mmHg and 90 beats/min for initial 2 hr after the operation. After for a while, the electrocardiogram (EKG) showed depression of ST-segment on all over the leads, the blood pressure fell to 80/30 mmHg, and the pulse rate reached to 100 beat/min. The persistent ischemic signs, including ST-segment depression, hypotension, LVEF of 30% and severe global hypokinesia on echocardiogram, despite of intravenous dopamine infusion of 10 µg/kg/min, made us to get an emergent CAG to confirm the patency of anastomosis. This CAG revealed severe spastic narrowing at the grafted coronary arteries (). Repetitive intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin resolved the coronary artery spasm, but ongoing depression of ST-segment was observed on EKG. So, CAG about non-grafted, innocent right coronary artery (RCA) had to be done. CAG demonstrated severe vasospasm of RCA (), and also it was resolved with intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin resulting in normalized ST-segment. Thereafter, he took oral medication of nicorandil as a vasodilator and CCB. He was discharged on the 15th postoperative day without reattack of coronary spasm. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> On Aug. 9th, 2019, a 75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 5 years, which was 1.5% low-calcium dialysate in a 4-to-5-h dwell three times every day and 2.5% low-calcium dialysate in an 8-to-10-h dwell once every night, was admitted to the nephrology department with an 1-week history of abdominal pain and a cloudy peritoneal dialysis effluent (Fig. a). The patient had a past medical history of hypertension. For the reason that his pressure was lower than before, the antihypertensive drugs were stopped on admission.\nPhysical examination revealed an emaciated man with a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg, a breath of 16 beats/min, a pulse of 76 beats/min and a temperature of 36.8 °C. A head examination revealed no face edema. The cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen, with moderate tenderness to palpation throughout particularly at the lower abdomen, moderate guarding with no rebound and normative bowel sounds. There was no discharge or erythema at the peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site. The tubing of the peritoneal dialysis catheter was intact and there was no macroscopic evidence of the peritoneal dialysis catheter damage.\nLaboratory tests on the admitted day were available. The blood routine examination was as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.00 × 109/L, a neutrophil ratio of 78.2%, lymphocyte ratio of 14.1%, red blood cell (RBC) count of 3.43 × 1012/L, hemoglobin of 83.10 g/L and platelet count of 110 × 109/L. The biochemical routine examination was as follows: sodium 137.00 mmol/L, potassium 2.97 mmol/L, chloride 95.0 mmol/L, glucose 7.4 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 21.76 mmol/L and creatinine 878.2 μmol/L. BNP (natriuretic peptide B) was 135 pg/ml and myoglobin was 402.4 ng/ml. The initial peritoneal effluent analysis further revealed as follows: WBC count of 1537.0 × 106/L, chloride 105.8 mmol/L, glucose 20.8 mmol/L, total protein 2.59 g/L, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 54.8 U/L, adenosine deaminase (ADA) 0.9 U/L. The changes of important laboratory results were being detected during the admitted period (Fig. c).\nBased on the history, physical examination and laboratory results with the findings in the peritoneal dialysis fluid, a diagnosis of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis was confirmed. Besides related symptomatic treatments, the empiric antibiotic treatment was initiated with levofloxacin (0.5 g intravenously) every day, ceftazidime (0.25 g intraperitoneally) in a 3-h dwell four times every day and vancomycin (1.0 g intraperitoneally) in an 8-h dwell once at night every 5 days. Final culture of initial peritoneal effluent results indicated the organism was P. multocida, which was found to be sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, meropenem, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, while in the blood there were no bacterial infections were having been found. According to the drug-sensitive test, the intravenously antibiotic treatment was switched to meropenem (0.5 g intravenously) every 12 h, with peritoneal antibiotic treatment still. After one-day treatment, the symptoms disappeared but the WBC count of peritoneal effluent was still above the normal level of the WBC counts, which reminded the infection remained existed. Therefore, Cefazidime was switched to amikacin (200 mg intraperitoneally) in a 3-h dwell four times every day and on Aug. 18th, intravenously meropenem was switched to cefoperazone/sulbactam (1.5 g intravenously) every 12 h. And for the reason that the CAPD was noneffective and the peritoneal infection was not controlled, the patient was undergone temporary hemodialysis four times every week with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg intraperitoneally) in a 6-h dwell every day for continuing peritoneal antibiotic treatment. After 12-day antibiotic treatment, the WBC count of peritoneal effluent was not significantly improved and the peritoneal effluent was still cloudy. When it was the deadline of the ISPD guideline recommending to hemodialysis, the patient firmly refused the lasting hemodialysis and asked for a further treatment. According to the drug-sensitive results and reviewed case reports (Table ), the patient was switched to ampicillin/sulbactam (3 g intravenously) twice every day. The WBC count of peritoneal effluent was markedly improved and the antibiotic treatment was continued until the WBC count of the peritoneal effluent was below 100 × 106/L and the PD effluent was clear, which revealed the infection was controlled (Fig. b, c). During the treatment, the patient was undergone temporary hemodialysis 12 times to maintain the function of excretion. When the infection was controlled and the function of CAPD recovered, the temporary hemodialysis was stopped and the patient was returned to CAPD. The patient discharged after using ampicillin/sulbactam for 17 days and continued amoxicillin (0.25 g orally) three times a day for another 6 days. The detail key dates of altering antibiotics and methods have been listed (Table ).\nThe patient and his family were thankful to us and cooperated the further inquiry with us. On further inquiring, the patient reported that he had had a cat at home and when the patient did CAPD, the cat was usually playing with the tubing or contacting the patient during CAPD. However, during his peritoneal dialysis exchange, every step of peritoneal dialysis went all right, without noticing any abnormalities. The patient has suffered from peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis once in the near 2 years but the causes were not P. multocida. He did not report this incident in admission. After treatment, he continues CAPD to do well. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 21.76 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 21.76 mmol. To convert 21.76 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.76 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.022 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.022 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.616 g bun. To convert 0.616 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.616 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 616.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 616.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 61.6 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 21.76 mmol bun/L converts to 61.6 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 7.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 7.4 mmol. To convert 7.4 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.4 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1261.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 7.4 mmol glucose/L converts to 126.1 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 137.0 + (61.6 / 2.8) + (61.6 / 18) = 303.006 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 303.006 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 14-month-old boy presented to our department with a 2-day history of high fever and appetite loss, without any signs of upper respiratory infection such as cough or nasal discharge. He had been diagnosed with bilateral CC at 35 weeks' gestation by prenatal pleurocentesis. He was delivered by emergency caesarean section due to progressive hydrops fetalis at 36 weeks and 1 day gestation with a birthweight of 3,426 g. Immediately after birth, he was intubated in the operating room () because of a lack of spontaneous respiration, and bilateral chest tubes were inserted. The left-sided chest tube was removed on the 13th day of life owing to gradual reduction of the left chylous fluid. He was also diagnosed with supravalvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) with a pressure gradient of 40–45 mmHg (Figures and ) between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. In addition to hydrops fetalis, lymphatic maldevelopment, and PS, he showed the unique facial features such as tall-forehead and low posterior hairline, hypertelorism, and down-slanting palpebral fissures, which led us to diagnose Noonan syndrome []. Furthermore, he showed pectus carinatum diagnosed using CT-based pectus index of 1.90 () (diagnostic range: 1.42–1.98 []). Thus, according to the scoring system of clinical features [], he had 3 major symptoms and 2 minor symptoms of Noonan syndrome (). Hydrops fetalis is also reported to be associated with Noonan syndrome []. Balloon angioplasty was performed on day 54 of life, which proved to be ineffective. Right-sided chylous fluid was constantly drained until around 30–40 days, and then the draining was gradually decreased and stopped at 71 days of life after various treatments, including intravenous administration of prednisolone and octreotide complemented with serum albumin and immunoglobulin and feeding with a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) formula. Although he temporarily tolerated an increased ratio of breast and ordinary milk to the MCT formula, reincreasing the right chylous fluid led him to be fed by pure MCT formula with essential unsaturated fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. He was discharged on the 141st day of life from the neonatal care unit with some residual pleural effusion on the right ().\nOn physical examination, he weighed 8.9 kg (1.0 standard deviation), and his height was 75 cm (0.8 standard deviation). His temperature was 39.8 C, blood pressure was 95/45 mmHg, heart rate was 180 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 98% with 1.5 L/min of oxygen inhalation through a face mask. He showed no otolaryngologic findings. On lung auscultation, right-sided breath sounds were decreased with chest retractions and tachypnoea. His heart examination revealed a grade-3 systolic murmur in the left second intercostal space. Laboratory findings indicated an increased inflammatory response with a white blood cell count of 38,200 μL, 83.4% neutrophils, and C-reactive protein level of 27.49 mg/dL. Immunological studies revealed that his immunoglobulin ratio (G/M) was 975/96 mg/dL, complement component ratio (3/4) was 99/22.3 mg/dL, complement activity (CH50) was 42.3 U/mL, and the percentages of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells were 21.8%, 9.0%, 41.8%, and 15.7%, respectively. Urinalysis showed no signs of urinary tract infection.\nChest radiography revealed pleural effusions within the entire circumference of the right lung with prominent intestinal dilatation (). We percutaneously drained purulent pleural effusions and started empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone. The triglyceride concentration of pleural effusions was 299 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 1214 U/mL, which confirmed the diagnosis of chylothorax [, ]. Two days later, E. coli was detected in the effusions and blood culture which were obtained on admission. In view of the sensitivity to aminobenzyl penicillin (ABPC), we decided to deescalate ceftriaxone to ABPC. Although respiratory symptoms resolved with decreased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, intermittent fever continued. On the 18th day of hospitalization, the boy developed high fever, and contrast medium-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density lesion (3 cm in diameter) with a high-density capsule in the right inferior lobe (). The lesion was diagnosed as a lung abscess that resulted from thoracic empyema. Medication was changed from ABPC back to ceftriaxone for another three weeks. After confirming abscess improvement on CT and chest radiograph (Figures and ), the patient was discharged from our department on the 59th day of hospitalisation. Cardiac catheterization to evaluate PS before discharge showed 7 mmHg of right atrial pressure (RAP), systolic right ventricular pressure (RVP)/end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 90/10 mmHg, and main pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 24/10 (mean 16). Thus, RV-main PA pressure gradient was 66 mmHg. He underwent surgical repair of the supravalvular PS. Postoperative echocardiography revealed trivial tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) with estimated RVP of 24 mmHg and PS of 1.6 m/s with estimated RV-PA pressure gradient of 10 mmHg.

During operation, we encountered a firm mass adhesive to spermatic cord vessels and vas deferens, so it was impossible to resect the mass completely; we then decided to do a biopsy from the mass.\nThe pathologist reported primary or metastatic adenocarcinoma, and then the patient underwent trans-inguinal radical orchiectomy with complete mass resection, according to the pathologist's report of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the spermatic cord; after the resection, the margin was free of tumor. Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and negative for Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA), S100, desmin, vimentin, Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE), thyroglobulin, Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). He was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Gastroenterologist consultation was done, after which upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy were recommended, both of which had normal result. PSA (free and total) was in normal range. Transrectal sonography revealed an area (13 × 17 mm) with non-homogeneous echogenicity in the peripheral side of the left prostate lobe and biopsy was done, which reported as normal prostatic tissue and one core was granulation tissue. Laboratory findings include: White Blood Cells (WBC) = 6700/μl [Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMN) = 63%, Lymph = 27%), Hemoglobin (Hb) = 17.2 gr/dl, Platelet Count Test (PLT) = 217,000/μl, Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) = 105 mg/dl, albumin = 4.9 g/dl, protein = 8.1 g/dl, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) = 25 U/L, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) = 58 U/L, calcium = 13 mg/dl, Na = 126 meq/L, K = 4.6 meq/L, Cr = 0.84 mg/dl, Urea = 24 mg/dl, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) = 18 (NL:8-69) pg/ml, 2ME = 1/160, total bilirubin = 0.9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin = 0.28 mg/dl, Magnesium = 2.42 mg/dl (NL:1.8-2.6), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) = 428 U/L, Alkaline phosphatase = 256 U/L. Wright = 1/160, Coombs Wright = 1/320. Hepatitis B Surface. Antigen (HbsAg), anti-Hepatitis C Virus Antibody (HCV Ab), and HIV Antibody (HIV Ab) all showed negative results. Thyroid function tests yielded normal results. Tumor markers including CA15-3, CA19-9, ß-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (ß-hCG), and AFP were in normal ranges. Abdominopelvic computed tomographic (CT) scan showed severe distention in the stomach and jejunum. Serum 8 am basal fasting cortisol level was 29.01 ug/dl (Nl:6.2-19.4). Abdominopelvic sonography showed distention only in the gastrointestinal loops. Chest X-ray and brain CT scan were reported to be normal. Whole body bone scan was unremarkable. We consulted with infectious disease specialist who recommended starting anti-brucellosis therapy for the patient due to elevation of Wright's and Coombs Wright's tests. Therefore, we administered ofloxacin and rifampin for the patient.\nIn the hospital, his nausea and vomiting did not resolve and he developed a state of delirium and abdominal distention. In repeated physical examination, we found sinus tachycardia, tenderness, and guarding in abdominal examination. We sent for a surgical consultation, but before consultation his family got the patient released from the hospital. They took him to another centre and at that center with diagnosis of acute abdomen he had been underwent laparotomy. During operation, the surgeon noticed a small bowel loop with a stricture in the middle portion and a tumoral lesion in that area with serosal involvement. Small bowel tumor resection revealed small bowel adenocarcinoma with full thickness and vascular involvement and three nodes out of six lymph nodes were involved. Chemotherapy with Capecitabine-plus-Oxaliplatin (XELOX) regimen was started and continued at three-week intervals. At present, six months after the operation, he has a good general condition, without any metastatic symptoms and signs. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 52 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 164.5 cm, which is 164.5 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.645 m. The patient's weight is 82.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 82.0 kg / (1.645 m * 1.645 m) = 30.303 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 30.3, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 164.5 cm, which is 164.5 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 64.764 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (64.764 (in inches) - 60) = 60.957 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 60.957 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 60.957 kg + 0.4 * (82.0 kg  - 60.957 kg) = 69.374 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 69.374 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 52) * 69.374 * 1) / (1.1 * 72) = 77.082 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 77.082 mL/min.",

In regards to his past medical history, the patient was on treatment for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. In particular, he was on an angiotensin II receptor blocker and on warfarin as an oral anticoagulant.\nThe patient was afebrile, and his vital signs were within normal values (blood pressure 115/78 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats/min, SpO2 99%). Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain, radiating on the posterior aspect of the left thigh. Peripheral vascular examination was within normal values on both lower limbs, with palpable pulses and capillary refill time of less than two seconds. Neurological condition, on the other hand, was impaired on the left lower limb, and objective deficiencies were obvious. Examination revealed reduced strength of the left lower limb. The patient was unable to straight leg raise, to flex the hip or the knee, and had developed hypoesthesia on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The patella reflex was absent on the affected side.\nLaboratory data revealed prolonged prothrombin time with an international normalized ratio (INR) level of 4.5, and a haematocrit and haemoglobin decrease of 33.1% and 10.7 g/l, respectively. The rest of the full laboratory analysis was within normal values. Imaging studies included abdominal ultrasound scan (US), lumbar spine, and pelvis CT scans. Lumbar spine pathology was excluded, and a large retroperitoneal haematoma was unveiled within and around the left iliopsoas muscle (35 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm) (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and warfarin anticoagulation regimen was intermitted. Prolonged INR was reversed within 48 hours with the aid of vitamin K administration. A new CT scan was performed on day 3 post-admission. No change in the size of the haematoma was revealed (Figure ). At that point, there was a consultation with the radiology department whether the haematoma could be percutaneously drained; however, the CT scan revealed a clotted formation that would not allow for successful drainage.\nThe patient was managed conservatively.

During this time, she also experienced fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and weakness. In addition, she observed leaking and drainage around her G-tube site with associated erythema and intense abdominal pain. The patient denied sick contacts or recent travel.\nHer past medical history includes obesity, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, gastrojejunal ulcer, Kawasaki’s disease, subdural hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic pain syndrome, and anxiety. The patient’s past surgical history includes burr-hole craniotomy, lithotripsy, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by chronic refractory marginal ulceration and small bowel obstruction requiring two resections, ventral hernia repair, and gastrostomy tube insertion.\nThe patient was pregnant six times and had six miscarriages (G6P0060). She lives with her husband and adopted son with good social support. She is currently unemployed. The patient denies ever smoking and does not drink alcohol. Familial history consists of diabetes, heart disease, and nephrolithiasis in the patient’s mother.

She was also on daily vitamin A, D3, and B-complex supplements and a monthly cyanocobalamin 1000 μg intramuscular injection, in addition to a nutritional supplement Isosource 1.5 Cal that is administered through the G-tube once every night.\nDue to her complex past surgical history, the patient was sent from her local emergency department to our hospital. At presentation, the patient was febrile to 101 ℉. Blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with erythema and purulent drainage around the G-tube site on the left upper quadrant. The general examination showed a thin patient who is alert and oriented. Mucous membranes were moist. Lungs were clear to auscultation as she was breathing comfortably on room air. Heart sounds were regular without murmurs. Extremities were warm with intact pulses bilaterally and no edema. However, she had moderate muscle loss for her age. Skin was intact except for the previously mentioned erythema around the G-tube. Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II–VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.\nSerum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 × 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 × 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.\nA fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 ℉, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient’s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).\nFollowing completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later. At the time of discharge, her hemoglobin remained stable at 11.2 g/dL, and she was able to tolerate an oral diet. She continues to follow up with her bariatric surgeon in clinic with no recurrence of fever or diarrhea. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Anesthesia was induced by sequential infusion of midazolam (1 mg), sufentanil (15 µg), propofol (150 mg, two infusions), and vecuronium (50 mg).\nImmediately after the second infusion of propofol, the patient’s heart rate suddenly increased to >105 beats/minute and maintained this rate for several seconds. His heart rate then sharply dropped to <30 beats/minute, with a simultaneous decrease in his blood pressure from >130/80 mmHg to 80/35 mmHg. His ECG showed premature ventricular contractions. Ephedrine (15 mg) was immediately given in two infusions. His heart rate increased to >60 beats/minute and his blood pressure returned to >125/80 mmHg. The results of a blood gas analysis were within normal limits. Tracheal intubation was then smoothly performed. The ECG revealed occasional supraventricular premature beats until 10 minutes after administration of the ephedrine. Propofol (4–6 mg/kg/hour), remifentanil (8–15 µg/kg/hour), and vecuronium (1 µg/kg/minute) were intravenously administered for maintenance of anesthesia.\nLaparoscopic radical prostatectomy was completed within 2 hours. During the whole surgical procedure, the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate remained stable at around 130/80 mmHg and 60 beats/minute, respectively. The ECG showed sinus rhythm. After surgery, the patient was smoothly extubated in the operating room and sent to the post-anesthesia care unit for further recovery. He was then sent back to the urology ward, and his postoperative course was uneventful until discharge from the hospital.\nThe reporting of this study conforms to the CARE guidelines. All protocols in this study were general and conventional without inducing additional risks or outcomes. Therefore, the requirement for ethics approval was waived. All patient details have been de-identified in this manuscript, and both verbal and written consent to treatment was obtained from the patient. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Both the wounds were badly contaminated and the amputated limb was bleeding. He was on Tab. Amlodipine 5 mg once daily for hypertension and, Glipizide 5 mg once daily and Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type-2 diabetes mellitus since 2 years. He was also a known case of HOCM and had undergone alcohol ablation of the interventricular septum one year ago.\nHe was conscious and oriented. His pulse rate was 120/m and the blood pressure (BP) in his left lower limb was 210/120 mmHg (mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 150 mmHg). A systolic murmur was heard over the left parasternal area. The respiratory system examination was normal. The mouth opening was one-and-a-half fingers breadth, he had Mallampati airway class-3 and the upper two incisors were loose and broken. Neck extension was restricted and the thyromental distance was three fingers breadth.\nHis haemoglobin was 11 g/dl, blood sugar was 173 mg/dl, blood urea was 26 mg/dl, serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl and serum electrolytes were normal. An electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle branch block with left ventricular hypertrophy []. Echocardiography showed a thickened interventricular septum, systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 60 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, good right ventricular function and no mitral regurgitation. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with no signs of congestive cardiac failure. The cervical spine X-ray revealed spondylotic changes at C5-C7.\nAn intravenous access was secured on the left foot. The right dorsalis pedis artery was cannulated and continuous BP monitoring was initiated. Intravenous fentanyl 150 μg and labetalol 10 mg, followed by an infusion of 2 mg/min, were administered. After 20 min, his heart rate decreased to 106/min and BP to 196/114 mmHg (MAP 140 mmHg). He was scheduled for emergency hemostasis and debridement of the amputated limb and contused lacerated wound. The patient was nil-by-mouth for 2 h.\nIn the operation theater, after applying the standard monitors, the right subclavian vein was cannulated and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring was initiated. The initial CVP was 4 mmHg. The BP had decreased to 180/110 mmHg (MAP = 133 mmHg) and pulse rate to 90-100/min. It was decided to achieve the hemostasis and debride the amputated limb first, and follow it up with debridement of the CLW.\nRight brachial plexus block was performed via a supraclavicular approach using a 23 G needle. After eliciting paraesthesia, a mixture of 6 ml 2% lignocaine and 18 ml 0.5% bupivacaine was injected slowly with frequent aspirations. He was sedated with intravenous midazolam 2 mg following initiation of the block. The debridement and revision amputation were completed in 120 min. Following this, left axillary block was performed with a mixture of 8 ml 2% lignocaine and 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine using a multiple injections technique. Both the blocks worked adequately. Intraoperatively, the pulse rate and MAP were maintained at 80-90/min and 110-120 mmHg, respectively. The total blood loss was 500-550 ml. The blood sugar was monitored hourly, and it was maintained between 100 and 200 mg/dl with insulin infusion. The surgeries were uneventful and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. Analgesia lasted for 6 h post-operatively, which was managed further with fentanyl infusion. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 50 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 1.58 m. The patient's weight is 80.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 80.0 kg / (1.58 m * 1.58 m) = 32.046 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 32.0, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 1.58 m, which is 1.58 m * 39.3701 in/m = 62.205 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.205 (in inches) - 60) = 55.071 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 55.071 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 55.071 kg + 0.4 * (80.0 kg  - 55.071 kg) = 65.043 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 65.043 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 50) * 65.043 * 1) / (1.3 * 72) = 62.541 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 62.541 mL/min.",

Current medications include 6-mercaptopurine, amlodipine, metoprolol, vitamin D, calcium, and a multivitamin. He was previously treated with sulfasalazine and oral mesalamine. He sparingly required oral steroids throughout his life. In October 2018, he presented for a 5-month history of worsening watery diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. Stool studies, including Clostridium difficile, were negative. Colonoscopy to the neoterminal ileum revealed a Rutgeerts score of i3. He was started on oral budesonide as a bridge to biologic therapy.\nAfter starting 9 mg of budesonide, the patient immediately began to experience weakness and muscle aches. Three weeks later, these symptoms progressed and he was unable to walk or lift his arms above his head. He presented to the hospital, and laboratory tests revealed magnesium 0.8 mg/dL, potassium 1.7 mmol/L, creatinine 1.52 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase 15,913 IU/L, calcium 7.1 mg/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 253 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 125 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 734 IU/L.

    "problem": "<Context> The long-term treatment period of a Finnish, ethnically Caucasian, 21-year-old high school graduate and shop assistant, started when she was admitted to the acute ward of the local psychiatric hospital in August 2007 with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa according to the criteria of the ICD-10. Her eating disorder had started in 2001, when she was 13 and began to exercise and avoid fattening food. Her weight dropped from 78 kg to 49 kg (her height is 178 cm) in a few months. At that time her parents were having severe marital problems. However, the parents did not separate or divorce. At the same time Ms. P.M. had started high school in a boarding school about 50 km away from her home, which was an exceptional choice as boarding schools are a rarity in Finland.\nDuring the first months of her eating disorder she had psychiatric outpatient treatment, but in summer 2002 her condition deteriorated as she started bulimic behaviour and vomiting, and also had symptoms of depression (depressive mood, loss of pleasure, low energy, insomnia). In September 2003 she was admitted to the Department of Adolescence Psychiatry, Tampere University Hospital and hospitalized for two months. During her hospital treatment she had no psychotropic medication. Her relationship to her parents was found to be exceptionally close and she had only one friend of her own age. There were many unsolved family problems but abuse was not among them. However, the eating disorder had brought the parents closer to each other, which pleased the patient.\nThe patient subsequently resumed psychiatric outpatient treatment until spring 2005. The outpatient treatment consisted of visits to a psychologist with CBT training once a week, psychotropic medication (fluoxetine 40-60 mg/day), and nutritional advising. She was able to complete her high school studies with good grades in May 2005. She then got a job as a shop assistant. She moved away from her parents' home with her only (female) friend as a room-mate. She also began occasionally dating a boyfriend of her own age and the relationship was a good one. In summer 2007 her room-mate moved to another town to work. Soon after that the patient's eating disorder became more severe and she had amenorrhoea. She also began to mutilate herself with a knife and to drink quite a lot of alcohol (cider). She was admitted to the acute ward of the local psychiatric hospital in August 2007. At that time her weight was 56.2 kg and Body Mass Index (BMI) 17.7. The patient's hospital treatment was then two months. After that there was an outpatient period of seven weeks, a new hospital treatment of one month, and again an outpatient treatment of six weeks. Poor compliance was the biggest problem in this outpatient treatment.\nSince the beginning of April 2008 she has been almost continuously hospitalised for more than a year (there was a short period of outpatient treatment in August 2008). She began her psychiatric inpatient treatment again in the local hospital. At the beginning of summer 2008 her weight was 40.0 kg and BMI 12.6. At that time she was admitted for two weeks for rapid nasogastric refeeding on the medical ward of the local hospital. Her weight rose to 49.6 kg in only two weeks, making her mood more and more anxious. Thereafter she was admitted to the psychiatric ward of the University Hospital, again for four days on the medical ward of the University Hospital, and then back to the psychiatric ward. Besides anorexia nervosa (F50.0), major depressive disorder (MDD; F32.2) was also diagnosed according to the criteria of the ICD-10. Her symptoms of depression were: lowering of mood, reduction of energy, decrease in activity, reduced capacity for enjoyment and interest, hopelessness, appetite diminished, feelings of worthlessness, agitation and suicidal acts. She had delusional thoughts about her body shape and weight. She totally refused to eat and regarded even water as a fattening foodstuff. She tried to vomit aggressively and exercise physically all the time. Mechanical restraints, nasogastric refeeding, and constant observation 24 hours a day were provided. She nevertheless managed to abuse herself by hysterical cutting and vomiting. At that time her medication included fluoxetine (60 mg/day) and olanzapine (30 mg/day) and also lorazepam (2 mg/day) before main meals. Later on fluoxetine was supplied in a combination of venlafaxine (150 mg/day) and mirtazapine (60 mg/day). Because the symptoms of MDD were not relieved with AD treatment, ECT was used. ECT was administered three times a week. Anaesthesia was induced with methohexital and muscle relaxation with succinylcholine. Physiological monitoring included pulse oximetry, blood pressure, ECG, four channel EEG and EMG. She had ten bifrontotemporal ECT sessions in July 2008. The psychotropic medication was continued during the ECT treatment. There were no anaesthetic complications. The respective Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [] scores were 52 and 35 before and after the ECT treatment, meaning that her depression was not totally relieved. Clinically, the patient was satisfied with the outcome of the ECT, her behaviour continued to be self-destructive but her mood was better, she was more active, no longer hopeless, no longer delusional, and her appetite was no longer impaired. BMI had risen only slightly from 15.0 to 15.3. She continued exercising but the vomiting had diminished.\nIn August 2008 she first spent three weeks on the psychiatric ward of the local hospital and then returned to the psychiatric ward of the University Hospital with BMI only 13.8. She had started to exercise aggressively again. At the beginning of September 2008 her BMI was only 12.2. Two short treatment periods of nasogastric refeeding on the medical ward were initiated. She then requested a new series of ECT. Before the ECT her BDI was 35, her Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [], score 28 and BMI 14.2. After 12 bifrontotemporal ECT treatments BMI had risen slightly to 14.6, her mood was slightly better according to MADRS (scoring 24) and she began to smile, but she was acting out (lying and stealing) and the self-rated BDI was higher than it was before the ECT: 43. Vomiting and exercising had diminished quite a lot. In October 2008 she was transferred to a psychiatric ward specialized in treating refractory patients. At that time a decision was taken on mECT: bifrontotemporal ECT once a week or once in two weeks. The medication was again supplied: quetiapine (600-800 mg/day) was used instead of olanzapine and fluoxetine (60-70 mg/day) instead of other ADs. She had creative art therapy and physiotherapy in order to improve her body image of which physiotherapy was of some help by teaching the patient to relax. In December 2008 she was allowed to spend some days at (her parents') home. By the end of 2008 BMI was16.4 and she had no symptoms of depression. During the first weeks of 2009 mECT was only given once in 4 weeks. Very soon she became anxious again and started exercising, stealing sweets, binge eating, vomiting with the help of various hoses, and evacuating her rectum. Her mood became low and she was tired and hopeless. In the middle of February 2009 the frequency of mECT was then temporarily increased to twice a week for two months. Her mood improved and she was active and optimistic. Her weight remained at 50-51 kg (BMI about 16) until the beginning of April. The most aggressive exercising and vomiting faded away. Then quetiapine was changed to aripiprazole (20-30 mg/day), and at the same time the frequency of mECT was changed to once in 2 weeks. A new type of therapy was also initiated: the patient was given more responsibility for her own behaviour and the use of strict weight limits in order to obtain new benefits was abandoned. Her mood remained in balance and the acting out behaviour (stealing, lying, hysterical cutting) declined, but her weight dropped rapidly from 51 kg to 46 kg (BMI 14.5) in only eight weeks.\nMs. P.M. underwent a series of 10 ECT in the summer, a series of 12 ECT in the autumn, and a total of 23 mECTs during the winter and spring 2008-9. In order to control for possible side-effects of the mECT, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of her head was taken and a psychologist's assessment was conducted in May 2009. The MRI was normal. Maintenance ECT was discontinued in order to get a psychologist's assessment of memory functions during a four-week time free of ECT. Soon depressive symptoms again became prominent: low mood, reduction in energy, difficulties in concentrating, but no hopelessness or suicidality. BMI remained low at 14.5. However, according to the psychologist's assessment in May 2009, the patient's cognitive capacity had been impaired during the last 21 months. A shorter psychological assessment had been conducted in August 2007 and at that time the patient's cognitive skills were clearly better (IQ was 116 in August 2007 and 102 in May 2009). Moreover, her memory functions three weeks after the latest ECT yielded a very uneven memory profile, indicating difficulties in verbal memory (word lists) possibly due to fluctuating attention. The psychologist's assessment even suggested that the patient's semantic memory might have deteriorated. As we did not want to expose her to possible difficulties with memory the idea of more mECT was abandoned.\nShe has now been 10 weeks without mECT. Her regular medication has been aripiprazole 30 mg/day, fluoxetine 60 mg/day and lorazepam 1 mg twice a day before main meals. At first her mood became depressive, but after 5-6 weeks she was no longer depressive but only feeling down once in a while. Her BMI has slightly risen from 14.8 to 15.3. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He was diagnosed diabetic ketoacidosis induced by acute pancreatitis along with acute kidney injury from dehydration. Computed tomography of abdomen demonstrated the evidence of acute inflammation of pancreas. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no gallstones or bile duct dilatation. The patient denied any history of recent alcohol use and his serum triglyceride level was normal at 95 mg/dL (normal range, <150 mg/dL). Therefore, canagliflozin was likely the cause of acute pancreatitis in this case. The patient was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid along with intravenous insulin infusion. His serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, lipase, and amylase level returned to normal after 3 days, and we could stop insulin infusion after the anion gap returned to the normal range. His visions returned to baseline after his blood glucose was well controlled. Canagliflozin was completely discontinued and subcutaneous glargine insulin was restarted.

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 125.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 94.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 1.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 1.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 1.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 1.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 1.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 1.9 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (94.0 mEq/L + 1.9 mEq/L) = 29.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.1 mEq/L. Plugging in 29.1 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 29.1 - 12 = 17.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 17.1 mEq/L.",

Chest pain and shortness of breath were increased in severity on exertion and were associated with palpitation, but there is no history of sweating, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and convulsion. There was no radiation of chest pain. Chest pain was suddenly increased for last five days and the patient was admitted in the emergency department with a suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There was no history of fever, hemoptysis, leg swelling, and facial puffiness. History of significant weight loss and anorexia were present. There was no history of household contact with the patient of sputum smear positive tuberculosis. The patient received formoterol + tiotropium metered dose inhaler (2 puffs once daily with spacer) and oral doxofylline (400 mg twice daily) for last five years, as he suffered from chronic bronchitis predominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which resulted in persistent breathlessness, cough, and expectoration.\nGeneral survey revealed anemia and clubbing, but there was no cyanosis, edema, and engorged neck vein. There were multiple cervical and supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes on left side, which were hard in consistency, discrete, nontender, and fixed to underlying structure, but not fixed to overlying skin, and there was no discharging sinus. His temperature was 37°C, respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute, pulse rate 120 beats/minute, regular blood pressure 94/64 mmHg, oxygen saturation in capillary blood (SpO2) 96% @ room air, and FiO2 0.21.\nExamination of respiratory system revealed no abnormality, except vesicular breath sound with prolonged expiration on both sides, bilateral crackles, mainly over the bases of the lungs, and occasional wheezes. Examination of other system was normal. Complete hemogram showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 7.1 g/dL. Blood biochemistry was normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atypical ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in lateral chest leads (Lead V4, Lead V5, and Lead V6). Initial rapid troponin-t-test was inconclusive, but repeat one after 12 hours of first test was negative. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and Gram stain was negative, and pyogenic culture of sputum showed no growth. Chest X-ray posteroanterior (PA view) showed cardiothoracic ratio was more than 0.5; that is, size of the cardiac silhouette was increased, but lung parenchyma was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax showed a large, nonhomogenous mass lesion in right lower lobe which invaded the left atrium and was compressing the adjacent ventricular walls (). There was also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed discrete clusters of malignant epithelial cells which showed nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, pale cytoplasm, and ill-defined cell boundary—suggestive of non-small-cell carcinoma, possibly squamous cell variety (). FNAC of left sided supraclavicular lymph nodes showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Sputum for malignant cell was negative and fibre optic bronchoscopy did not show any abnormality. Echocardiogram showed a large echogenic mass of 15 × 12 mm, attached to the roof of the left atrium adjacent to right pulmonary venous openings, encroaching to interatrial septum, an extension of the tumour from adjacent lung parenchyma. Ejection fraction was 66%. Ultrasound of abdomen and CECT scan of brain were normal. Hence the diagnosis was a non-small-cell carcinoma of lower lobe of right lung with invasion of the left atrium and compression of adjacent ventricular wall (T4 disease) with contralateral supraclavicular metastatic lymphadenopathy (N3 disease). First cycle chemotherapy regimen comprising intravenous cisplatin (100 mg on day 1) and etoposide (100 mg on days 1, 2, and 3) was given, but unfortunately he died just after completion of first cycle. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

His medical history included permanent atrial fibrillation and bilateral hip replacement. His symptoms were graded as NYHA II, with dyspnea on exertion and fatigue being his main symptoms. This patient was triaged as urgency Level 2.\nUsing conscious sedation, TAVR was successfully performed through transfemoral approach, with no valvular and paravalvular regurgitation. However, the procedure was complicated by bleeding of the right femoral artery due to unsuccessful placement of the closure device, necessitating surgical repair under general anesthesia and admission to the ICU. The same evening of the TAVR procedure, the patient was transferred to the CCU. The patient was discharged to the cardiology ward of the referring hospital for further rehabilitation the following day, and discharged home 4 days after TAVR.\nSeven days after discharge (and 11 days after TAVR), the patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, dyspnea and orthopnea. Chest CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities and possible peribronchial infection in the left lower lobe. Subsequent PCR testing was positive for COVID-19.

Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.

He was a nonsmoker, did not endorse regular alcohol use, and denied any illicit drug use. His family history was noncontributory. His vitals at presentation were temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen Saturation 93% on room air. Home medications included bumetanide 1 mg daily, metolazone 1.25 mg twice a week, carvedilol 12.5 mg daily, and dabigatran 75 mg twice a day. Complete blood count (CBC) was unremarkable, and basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed creatinine of 2.2 mg/dl (near baseline). NT-pro-BNP was elevated at 18,500 pg/ml (baseline 2000s). Troponin was elevated at 0.36 ng/ml.\nUrology was consulted, and patient underwent cystoscopic evaluation for hematuria. Clot evacuation and fulguration of diffuse bladder lesions were performed. Bladder biopsy was also obtained, and subepithelial amyloid deposits were identified based on Congo-red stain.\nIn the following days, the patient developed intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hypotension, liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) peaked at 3000 (U/L) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) at 2000 (U/L). Remaining liver function tests showed alkaline phosphatase 50 (U/L), bilirubin 3-4 mg/dl, hyperammonemia (72 mcmol/L) and elevated international normalized ration (INR) around 4. Computed tomography imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for any acute process but showed cardiomegaly that was seen in the plain chest radiography as well. Workup for any acute infectious or inflammatory processes (viral markers, acetaminophen levels, and autoimmune markers) for evaluation of acute liver dysfunction did not reveal any alternate diagnosis, thereby suggesting acute decompensation from shock liver.\nEchocardiogram demonstrated worsening of ejection fraction (EF) to 10–15% with concentric left ventricle hypertrophy, impaired left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, thickened interventricular septum more than 12 mm, normal biventricular dimensions, biatrial dilation with no significant valvular abnormalities (findings compatible with cardiac amyloidosis) (). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was not performed due to underlying CKD. His condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to the cardiac care unit for acute decompensated heart failure. He was started on milrinone infusion with transient improvement in his cardiac function and end organ perfusion.\nHe was evaluated for cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade but deemed unstable from medical standpoint to undergo the procedure.\nHematology team was consulted and performed biochemical workup for amyloidosis. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) did not show an M-spike. Serum-free light analysis (kappa/lambda ratio 2.9) and urine immunofixation studies were not significant ruling out evidence for plasma cell dyscrasias. Meanwhile, the mass spectrometry analysis of the bladder biopsy specimen confirmed wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) consistent with senile systemic amyloidosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was not performed as mass spectrometry has been demonstrated to be a well-validated technique to diagnose and classify amyloidosis [, ]. Genetic testing can help clarify if the disease was hereditary or not but was not performed in this case and remains a limitation.\nMultiple specialties including internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, and critical care were involved in the patient care, but despite aggressive management, patient's condition gradually deteriorated. Due to the poor prognosis in the setting of multiple comorbidities and decompensated heart failure, the patients' family decided to stop further treatment and focus on patients comfort only which was facilitated by the palliative care team. The patient passed away shortly thereafter from cardiac arrest, and the diagnosis was acute on chronic cardiac failure from senile systemic amyloidosis. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A single 46-year-old Thai woman presented with acute right hip pain after falling onto the ground and could not bear weight. Her underlying diseases were hypertension and mild intellectual disability (IQ=60). At the age often, she developed bilateral cataracts and underwent bilateral intraocular lens replacement at the age of about 20. Thereafter, a painless mass gradually developed at the medial side of the left foot and both Achilles tendons became enlarged. At the age of 43, she sustained a left femoral neck fracture owing to a fall in her home and underwent hip hemiarthroplasty ( and ). Her ambulatory status was household independence. A physical examination revealed a thin woman (height 153 cm, weight 38 kg) with her right lower limb in the external rotation position. The left posterior tibial tendon insertion and both Achilles tendons were enlarged in irregular shapes (-). Pes cavus in both feet and camptodactyly of her left little finger were observed. The hip radiographs showed a complete, totally displaced, transcervical fracture of the right femur, Garden classification Type 4 (). The proximal femur appearance was categorized as Dorr Type B. Retention of the well-fixed cementless bipolar prosthesis in the left hip was found. Other bone-surveying radiographs of spine, pelvis, and femurs revealed generalized osteopenia. She underwent hip hemiarthroplasty using a postero-lateral approach and a cementless bipolar prosthesis (Avenir Muller stem, Zimmer, Switzerland). There was an accidental crack of the calcar femorale during the stem insertion. A loop of cerclage wiring was then added to prevent fracture propagation. The posterior capsule and short external rotators were repaired. The operative record of the left hip hemiarthroplasty also noted a calcar femorale fracture during the prosthesis insertion warranting cerclage wiring. Cementless bipolar prosthesis (Modular Taperloc stem, Biomet, USA) had been implanted through a posterolateral approach. Since these clinical findings were largely in line with CTX, investigations for a definitive diagnosis were undertaken with patient consent. An Achilles tendon biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed tendinous xanthoma, characterized by lipid crystal clefts surrounded by foamy histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. Electrocardiography and a chest radiograph were unremarkable. Serum cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels were normal. Testing for serum cholestanol level was not available in our laboratory. Neurological evaluation found good motor function and mild cerebellar ataxia. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed non-enhancing hypodense lesions in both cerebellar hemispheres, with mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy ().\nMutation analysis in the CYP27A1 gene was investigated by extraction of the genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes and sent for singleton whole-exome sequencing analysis. The sequencing libraries were enriched by SureSelect Human All Exon V5 kits and sequenced using IlluminaHiSeq 4000 Sequencer. The data were mapped to the human GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence using CASAVA v1.7 (Illumina) followed by variant calling with SAM tools and annotated by ANNOVAR to generate gene-based annotation. A homozygous c.1072C>T (p.Gln358Ter, rs533885672) stop- codon mutation in exon 6 of the CYP27A1 (NM_000784.3) was identified in the patient. The family pedigree was plotted, and no consanguinity was found. Parental blood samples were not available.\nShe was prescribed oral calcium carbonate with Vitamin D2 for osteoporotic prophylaxis and allowed partial weight bearing for 6 weeks. The hip radiographs at the latest follow-up (post-operative 7 and 41 months for right and left hips, respectively) showed well-fixed and well-aligned femoral prostheses (-). The right leg was found to be 5 mm shorter. A CT scan of both hips and femurs demonstrated 12° and 15° anteversion of right and left femoral stems, respectively. The native acetabular anteversion was 23°. She occasionally had slight pain in both hips but no compromise in activity. She could stand without support and walk with a slight limp for 10–15 minutes. She was capable of going up or down stairs with handrails. Both hip joints had a full range of movement with Harris hip scores of 81 points equally. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

His diarrhea had been present for eight months and had been evaluated with a colonoscopy three weeks prior to presentation. The colonoscopy revealed four polyps, all of which were biopsied. Three polyps were tubular adenomas and one polyp in the sigmoid colon was carcinoid.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed him to be an ill-appearing African American male in moderate distress. He was alert and oriented but unable to recall specific details of his history. His temperature was 37°C, pulse 137 beats per minute, and blood pressure 117/76 mmHg. Examination of the oropharynx revealed dry mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary exam revealed tachycardia with a regular rhythm and clear lungs to auscultation. He had tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant as well as right costovertebral angle tenderness. There was evidence of a right below-the-knee amputation with a well-healed stump.\nLaboratory data on admission was notable for a white blood cell count of 15.3 k/uL with 86% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL (decreased from 10.4 g/dL six months prior), and platelet count of 64 k/uL (decreased from 253 k/uL six months prior). Haptoglobin was within normal limits making significant intravascular hemolysis unlikely. Serum creatinine was 14.6 mg/dL, which was increased from 3.8 mg/dL six months prior, and blood urea nitrogen was 141 mg/dL. There was an anion gap of 26 with lactic acid of 1.94 mmol/L. Urinalysis revealed 2+ protein, negative nitrites, trace leukocyte esterase, 2 red blood cells/hpf, 3 white blood cells/hpf, no casts, occasional bacteria, and no epithelial cells/hpf.\nHe was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for severe sepsis and acute renal failure. On admission, percutaneous blood cultures were collected in a sterile fashion and submitted to the microbiology lab in an aerobic bottle and an anaerobic bottle. A BacT/Alert 3D (BioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC) automated microbial detection system was used to detect bacterial growth. Once growth was detected, the broth was plated on solid media. On hospital day one, two out of four bottles of percutaneous blood cultures grew an organism on anaerobic blood agar that was identified as Gram-positive rods on Gram stain. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole were started due to concern for polymicrobial infection. CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed a 5 mm proximal to midureteral stone on the right with associated hydronephrosis, tiny (sub-2 mm) calculi in the bilateral collecting systems, and a small amount of free pelvic fluid along the bilateral paracolic gutters. On hospital day two, Vitek MS (BioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC), an automated mass spectrometry microbial identification system, identified the Gram-positive organism as C. perfringens. Antibiotics were narrowed to ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. On hospital day three, a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed. Placement of the nephrostomy tube returned grossly purulent urine. Gram stain of the right nephrostomy urine revealed Gram-variable rods. Ultimately, no bacteria grew from the right nephrostomy urine culture. Although no bacteria grew on urine culture, the Gram-variable rods are likely C. perfringens. The previously administered antibiotics likely disrupted the bacteria's cell wall affecting its Gram staining features. Clostridium species may stain as Gram-variable or even as Gram-negative rods as they are decolorized rapidly []. Moreover, with right-sided costovertebral tenderness on exam, right-sided nephrolithiasis with hydronephrosis on imaging, and purulent discharge on placement of his percutaneous nephrostomy tube, severe sepsis and bacteremia due to a urinary source are clinically supported. He was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for fourteen days. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were continued, as opposed to narrower coverage with penicillin, because of concern for polymicrobial infection.

    "problem": "<Context> A 35-year-old male presented with chief complaints of severe back pain and dehydration. Hours earlier, his family found him floating in a hot tub outside his parent’s suburban home, exposed to the midday summer heat of central Texas. His past medical history was pertinent for bipolar type schizoaffective disorder and substance use disorder (methamphetamines, marijuana, and cocaine). In the past, he had been admitted for his schizoaffective disorder and recently had been released from a correctional facility where he had been incarcerated for drug-related offenses. Collateral history from the patient’s family revealed the patient was recently released from a correctional facility and missed an appointment to receive a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (risperidone), but he was otherwise unmedicated and had no psychiatry follow-up. He was brought to the emergency department under a police order of emergency detention (POED) with chief complaints of extreme back pain and the sense that his house was “full of snakes.” The patient requested the medical team to perform a “full-body transplant” to alleviate his back pain and so he would be able to move on to “a new life.” The patient disclosed that he had been in the hot tub for several hours because it would, “protect [him] from the mind-controlling electric machine which creates these snakes that attack [him].” The patient denied any recent recreational or illicit substance use. The remainder of the history was deferred due to the patient’s psychosis. Initially, the patient was infused with two liters of Ringer's lactate solution in the emergency room and given a sitter to prevent him from leaving the patient care room.\nPhysical examination\nOn general inspection, the patient had a first-degree burn covering his bilateral upper torso, arms, and calves. He smelled of salt and appeared very dehydrated with dry mucus membranes of the mouth. Capillary refill was delayed to roughly four seconds and his forehead was covered in a fine coat of salt. Vital signs were pertinent for sinus tachycardia to the 120s and systolic blood pressure in the 110s/60s (mmHg). However, the patient was hemodynamically stable and did not require intensive stabilization or surgical intervention.\nLaboratory results\nA complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, toxicology screen, and HIV test were obtained. The patient’s urine sample was a dark brown color, like that of a dark tea, which led the team to order a creatine kinase (CK) level. The patient’s CK serum level was elevated at approximately 90,000 mg/dL (22 to 198 mg/dL). The patient’s urinary toxicology screen was positive for both benzodiazepines and methamphetamines. The CMP revealed a creatinine of approximately 5 mg/dL, significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and mild transaminitis, while other laboratory values were within normal limits (Table ). While awaiting laboratory findings, the primary care team ordered an abdominal ultrasound (US), which demonstrated no acute changes or morphologic alterations to the kidney parenchyma, ureters, or other urinary structures. Furthermore, the abdominal US did not demonstrate findings on the liver, gall bladder, or other gastrointestinal structures. These laboratory values and the imaging study led the primary medicine team to consult the nephrology team for potential hemodialysis for acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to rhabdomyolysis.\nConsultant team’s recommendations for management\nBased on the patient’s clinical condition, the nephrology team recommended aggressive IV fluid resuscitation at 200 mL/hr to facilitate the renal clearance of myoglobin. The nephrology team acknowledged that if the patient’s creatinine kinase levels continued to increase, they may need to begin hemodialysis. However, they were hopeful that conservative management would permit physiological recovery. As the patient faced a life-threatening condition and clearly lacked the capacity to refuse treatment, the psychiatry team acknowledged that they would likely need to file for an order of protective custody (OPC) to ensure that he would not be able to leave in his altered state, they also stated that they would start 1 mg of oral risperidone given once daily to treat his psychosis and baseline schizoaffective disorder and adjust the medications as needed from there.\nPsychiatric complications\nShortly after starting treatment for the ARF, the patient complained that he had no issues with his kidneys and that he wanted a transfer to another location to obtain a new body, exclaiming that “if you don’t even have a muscle regeneration machine, how can you call this a hospital?”. He stated that he did not want the IV catheter placed, the fluids given, or an X-ray taken as he “doesn’t want his plasma taken out.” After his mother arrived, the patient successfully removed his IV catheter and attempted to leave against medical advice (AMA), which he was unable to do secondary to his POED. The patient became increasingly agitated and required 5 mg of haloperidol, 2 mg of lorazepam, and 50 mg of diphenhydramine by intramuscular injection. Despite this, he continued to be agitated and aggressive, which necessitated another intramuscular injection of 5 mg of haloperidol and 2 mg of lorazepam. Reestablishing IV access proved to be very difficult leading to a six-hour delay in resuming fluid infusion.\nOver the following days, the patient was amenable to taking oral risperidone. However, he also called the police a total of four times stating that he was being held against his will and that the hospital was working to harm him. These accusations necessitated the medical team to collaborate with the police. With the support of the head of security, the team summoned a police officer from another floor to “answer the call” from the patient. The officer kindly explained that they had received his call, but that he had a legal order to remain in the hospital, and that it was important to listen to the doctors and take his medications. The patient agreed to take an oral dose of risperidone and expressed his willingness to restart the IV fluids. This helped resolve some of the patient’s guardedness, allowing for continued IV restoration of fluid status without the patient removing his catheter. Over the next several days, the patient’s urine output normalized, and laboratory tests returned reassuring serum creatinine levels. The primary care team transitioned the patient from IV fluid replacement to aggressive oral fluid replacement and the IV catheter was removed, which surprisingly alleviated nearly all of the patient’s paranoid ideations and distrust toward the medical team. After a total of 11 days of hospitalization, during which pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and case management all worked to ensure his proper physical and social care, the nephrology team and internal medicine team cleared him for discharge to inpatient psychiatry for treatment of his schizoaffective disorder. He was discharged on a 0.1 mg clonidine extended-release patch to be replaced weekly, 1 mg of risperidone taken orally twice daily, and 800 mg of sevelamer to be taken three times a day with meals. He and his parents were given education regarding his adherence to his medications, major signs and symptoms associated with medication use, and finally his rehabilitation plan for after the psychiatric hospitalization was discussed with the patient and his case manager. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "13.861",
    "Upper Limit": "15.321",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 35 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 5.0 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (5.0/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**35 * 1.0 = 14.591. Hence, the GFR value is 14.591 ml/min/1.73 m².",

    "problem": "<Context> A 53-year-old obese male presented due to a wound in his right thigh. He stated that the wound started as an itch and that it progressed to its current state in just 5 days. The wound started to smell bad. The patient had a history of diabetes, which he reports to be diet controlled. He is a truck driver by trade and says he does his best to do a good job with his diet. His past medical history was notable for testicular cancer status after radiation 9 years earlier. He states that his left groin skin has always been a little sensitive after the radiation and in that he often will itch it. He says this wound started out as an itch as well. Intense itching led to an open wound, at which point he applied povidone iodine and put a dressing on it. He was remarkably stoic, considering the extent of the wound.\nReview of systems is negative except as noted above. The patient specifically denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or headache. His prescribed medications included atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, Diltiazem and Lisinopril for hypertension, Metformin for diabetes, and Gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy. The patient had no allergies and his tetanus status was up to date.\nPatient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 145/85 mmHg; respiratory rate 20/min; pulse 91/min, SpO2 99%, temperature 36.7°C; and pain 8/10. On physical exam, he was alert and oriented to person, time, and place and in no acute distress. Pertinent positive findings included a 4 cm × 10 cm elliptical wound on the left thigh with necrotic flesh within, which was exquisitely foul smelling (). The left leg appeared somewhat mottled and cellulitic compared to right leg. Both legs had intact dorsalis pedis and popliteal pulses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.1 k/cm with the remainder of the CBC within normal limits. The metabolic panel revealed blood sugar of 398 and corresponding hyponatremia of 128 mmol/L. The chloride and bicarbonate were also low at 89 mmol/L and 21 mmol/L, respectively, yielding an elevated anion gap of 18. The patient also has had hypoalbuminemia with a value of 2.5 g/dL. Lactate was elevated at 2.8 mmol/L. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. Blood cultures were sent. The urinalysis demonstrated clear glycosuria with >500 mg/dL of glucose, as well as pyuria with 17 WBC per high power field. There was no ketonuria, leukoesterase, or elevated nitrates.\nAP and lateral radiographs of the left femur revealed mottled lucencies consistent with gas in the soft tissues of the medial thigh ().\nA duplex Doppler exam with real time grey-scale imaging, spectral Doppler with wave form analysis, color Doppler, and physiologic maneuvers including compression were done to evaluate the venous system of the left leg from the groin down through the popliteal fossa. Subcutaneous edema was noted in left thigh, but there was no sonographic evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\nThe patient's presentation was most concerning for gas gangrene versus necrotizing fasciitis. Patient looked remarkably well, despite the differential diagnosis. He was resuscitated with 4 L of NSS, 10 U of intravenous regular insulin, 1 g of intravenous Vancomycin, and 3.375 g of intravenous Piperacillin-Tazobactam. He was given 2 oxycodone tablets for analgesia. Patient's mentation remained intact throughout. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit where he underwent surgical debridement followed by hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. He also received diabetes education, as he was not taking his Metformin, but rather under the impression that he was doing a good job controlling his diabetes with diet. His decompensated diabetes was likely a contributing cause to his necrotizing fasciitis. Following hospitalization, the patient was discharged with complete resolution of the infection and left with blood sugar well controlled. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "128.394",
    "Upper Limit": "141.91",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 128.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 128.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 128.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 128.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 128.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 398.0 mg/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 128.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (398.0 - 100) = 135.152 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 135.152 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 16-year-old boy was referred for endoscopy due to severe IDA and recurrent hematochezia. He was noted to have mild intellectual disability at the level of elementary school but denied diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, or growth restriction. He initially denied hematochezia but later explained that he defecated feces stained with fresh blood 2 to 3 times a month for several years. His mother recalled that the patient had hematochezia at age 6 which led him to be misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids. The patient did not receive regular health care but visited the clinic for cellulitis treatment upon the diagnosis of IDA.\nThe patient had a height of 177.5 cm and a weight of 76.1 kg. His vital signs were stable and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Vascular engorgement was observed around the anus but no fissures were seen. A blood test showed a white blood cell count of 4,590/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 5.9 g/dL, a hematocrit of 23.2%, and a platelet count of 305,000/mm3. Mean corpuscular volume was determined to be 64.4 fL while ferritin level was at 3 ng/mL; these findings were suggestive of IDA. All other laboratory parameters were unremarkable.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge, dilated aberrant vein that drained both the splenic and left internal iliac veins (). This vein had developed most tortuously around the rectum. Congested small vessels around the rectum merged into the superior and middle rectal veins and drained into the left internal iliac vein. Additionally, the rectal mucosa showed prominent enhancement with associated thickening of the rectal walls. There was no evidence of arteriovenous malformations or fistulas. Doppler ultrasound of the liver demonstrated intact portal venous flow.\nColonoscopy was performed due to the suspicion of rectal varices based on the history and CT scan results. Colonoscopy showed numerous rectal polyps emerging up to 10 cm from the anus. Stalked or sessile polyps of various sizes were observed on the entire lumen of the rectum with some normal intervening mucosa. A few protruding vessels were identified. The polyp mucosa was covered with yellow-white fibrinous exudates and tortuous, dilated, superficial blood vessels were noted on their tips (). The entire colon and terminal ileum, except the rectum, were unremarkable. Biopsy specimens obtained from the tip of a polyp revealed diffused lymphocytic infiltration, crypt dilatation, mucinous infiltration of the crypt, and surface ulcerations (). These findings confirmed the cause of bleeding to be secondary to multiple rectal polyps.\nAlthough the hugely dilated aberrant vein in the abdomen was considered a venous malformation, other abnormal findings were also noted in the systematic physical examination including subtle hypertrophy of the right upper extremity and light red-colored port wine stains on the trunk and the lateral aspect of the lower extremities (). Additionally, no prominent difference was observed in the thickness of the lower extremities despite macrodactyly on the right second toe. Taken together, the characteristic port wine stains, right upper extremity hypertrophy, and abdominal venous malformation meet the classic triad of KTS. Hence, KTS was diagnosed.\nVarious kinds of interventions, including radiologic and surgical treatment, were considered for the treatment of the abnormal abdominal vascularity found in this patient. However, his parents opted to postpone aggressive treatment, and he was therefore prescribed oral iron supplementation. The patient continues to have intermittent hematochezia but his hemoglobin level is maintained at 15.5 mg/dL with intermittent oral iron supplementation. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

The patient's medical history revealed that he was suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome, complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia since March 2012, treated with periodic blood transfusions, alpha recombinant human erythropoietin 40,000 IU/week subcutaneously, and since the last month, with prednisone 25 mg/day, cutting down the dosage by half every week. The patient completed corticosteroid therapy few days before admission. He suffered also from previous ischemic stroke, moderate renal insufficiency, psychosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nOn admission the examination showed low-grade fever (37.2°C), fatigue, nonproductive cough, bilateral basal crackles, and wheezes at chest auscultation. His blood pressure was 118/78 mmHg, the heart rate was 82 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 95%. The patient's body weight was 76 kg. No other significant abnormalities were found. Two sets of blood cultures were drawn from different peripheral sites at the same time.\nMain laboratory tests performed on admission showed hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL, leukocytes 11.3 × 103/μL (neutrophils 77%, lymphocytes 16%, and monocytes 6.3%), platelets 202 × 103/μL, sedimentation rate 42 mm/h, creatinine 1.95 mg/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, and gamma globulin 29.5% with two monoclonal bands in gamma region. Other blood-chemistry tests did not show significant pathological values. The chest X-ray performed on admission disclosed multiple nodular acinar opacities throughout both lungs with diffuse interstitial thickening. The Mantoux skin test showed negative result. A sputum sample was collected, and Gram stain showed more than 25 neutrophils per low-power field and normal upper respiratory tract bacterial population, but no potential pathogens present. Culture was negative for common bacterial pathogens. A presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised patient was made, and antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously/die was started. In spite of that, the patient's conditions slightly worsened over the next couple of days, with decreased level of consciousness and low-grade fever (≤37.5°C) episodes every day. On the fourth day, the aerobic bottle of the first blood culture set flagged positive. Gram staining of positive bottle revealed branching Gram-positive rods () that were also weakly acid-fast on modified Kinyoun stain (). On the basis of these findings, Nocardia spp. bacteremia was suspected and ceftriaxone was replaced with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg intravenously three times daily, plus linezolid 600 mg intravenously twice daily. Positive blood culture was subcultured, and after 2 days of incubation very small colonies appeared on Columbia blood agar and were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) as Nocardia farcinica, with a score of 1.879 (). On the fifth day after subculturing, N. farcinica identification was confirmed by conventional biochemical tests. The isolate was susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin but resistant to ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and imipenem. Ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously twice daily was added. Sputum, collected again soon after presumptive diagnosis of nocardiosis, was cultured for Nocardia spp., but resulted negative after 10 days of incubation.\nOn day 10 the patient's level of consciousness deteriorated to a state of light coma, difficult to awaken, with worsening shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry showed values of 89%; therefore oxygen therapy was started via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute (FiO2 28%). A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain was performed, and it showed multiple enhancing focal lesions in the frontal regions (), midbrain, and in the cerebellum, and a chest CT scan showed multiple nodular lesions and bilateral pleural effusion (). Unfortunately, the patient was suffering from psychosis, and although in a coma, he was uncooperative when awakened; therefore a thoracentesis could not be performed. For the same reason, the patient refused noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy was continued via nasal cannula and then via Venturi mask with further increases. The patient died on day 18 of hospitalization. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Electrocardiogram and chest x-ray showed normal sinus rhythm and unremarkable radiographic findings. Echocardiographic features were normal, without evidence of heart failure or aortic coarctation. Twenty four hour urinary catecholamine and vanillymandelic acid level (5.3 mg) was within normal range. Plasma renin and aldosterone level were 6.67 ng/mL/hr and 11.09 ng/dL in the supine position, respectively and 9.96 ng/mL/hr and 20.47 ng/dL, respectively, when upright.\nKidney ultrasonography revealed no evidence of definite renal artery stenosis and computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined mass, 1.7×1 cm in size, in the middle pole of the right kidney (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also revealed a 1.8 cm small and solid mass in the same right kidney (), which had iso-signal intensity in the T1-weighted image and heterogenous, mild, low signal intensity in the T2-weighted image. Whole body bone scan showed no active bone lesions.\nThe patient underwent partial nephrectomy to remove the mass in the right kidney. Grossly, the renal parenchyme was a well-demarcated and oval mass with gray fish flesh-like cut surface and focally hemorrhage, measuring 1.5x1 cm (). The lesion was close to the surgical resection margin and low mitotic figures were identified. On microscopic examination, a relatively well-circumscribed tumor was identified. Thick-walled blood vessels were well developed, with a characteristic hemangio-pericytic pattern. Immunohistochemically, vimentin and CD34 staining were positive. On electron microscopy, the tumor cells displayed numerous secretory granules, some of which showed typical rhomboid crystalline-material that was thought to be renin protogranules (). Consequently, this mass was confirmed as a juxtaglomerular cell tumor.\nOn the second day after surgery, the level of plasma renin decreased to 0.01 ng/mL/h and blood pressure had normalized (120/80 mmHg).

He had no history of abdominal pain, fever, or cough. In 2016, he underwent an abdominoperineal resection procedure for carcinoma located in the distal one-third of the rectum. He also had a history of open appendectomy. The patient was an active smoker, was on medication for diabetes, had no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and was not using any immunosuppressive drugs. He had also received chemotherapy (10 cycles of FOLFOX6) for carcinoma. There was no history of any other comorbidities. Family, psychosocial, and genetic histories were insignificant.\nThe patient's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, heart rate was 82 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.4°C during the examination. His body mass index was 27.5 kg/m2. Abdominal examination in the erect position revealed a mass with a diameter of ~5 cm protruding above the stoma. He had midline and gridiron incisional scars. There was a parastomal hernia at the outer edge of the rectus abdominis muscle. The hernia was soft and reducible to the abdominal cavity in the supine position.\nComputed tomography (CT) examination revealed a parastomal hernia () with a diameter of 3 cm. Laboratory tests revealed a leukocyte count of 5.90 × 109/l, hemoglobin concentration of 65 g/l, neutrophil percentage of 61.8%, and platelet count of 149 × 109/l. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was 6.5%. The renal function test showed that creatinine was 79.2 μmol/l and urea was 7.21 mmol/l. Electrolytes and coagulation function were normal. There were no abnormalities detected in the electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram. The diagnosis at admission was post-operative rectal cancer with a parastomal hernia.\nUnder general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation or a laryngeal mask and pre-operative indwelling urinary catheterization were applied to the patient, who was in a supine position. The surgeons were standing contralateral to the stoma with the monitor over the surgical site. The stoma was sealed with an adhesive incise drape. The surgical field was divided into right and left partitions using the sterilized surgical towel to prevent any potential contamination.\nAn incision of 1.2 cm through the skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue was made at the right iliac region. The incised subcutaneous tissue was separated using a pair of retractors to expose and dissect aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Hemostatic forceps were used to separate the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. The primary extraperitoneal space was created using a finger. To create the preperitoneal space, 2 sets of 5-mm trocars were inserted at the site of surgical incision using the retrograde puncture technique (); the trocars were placed at ~5 cm to each side of the incision, and a 12-mm observation trocar was placed through the incision (). After successfully placing all three trocars, extrapneumoperitoneum was induced (11 mmHg CO2) for endoscope insertion.\nThe further extraperitoneal space was created under direct endoscopic guidance down to the pubic floor and up to the bladder, where it was easier to create. We then moved to the contralateral side of the abdomen; as the long midline incision in the abdomen made it very difficult to separate the peritoneum, the membrane was cut while avoiding damage to the tissue at the middle of the incision, thus weakening the abdominal wall. When performing cephalad dissection, we targeted the space between the rectus abdominis and posterior sheath. To create the space, we opened the lateral edge of the posterior sheath to penetrate the extraperitoneal space between the lateral and mid-abdomen. The TEP technique was used for this separation. The dissecting plane of the lateral space was the extraperitoneal space between the peritoneum and parietal plane. During separation, the peritoneum was dissected and observed to avoid damage to the bowel around the stoma. Through the space that was created by separation, we enlarged the extraperitoneal space within a 15- to 20-cm radius around the stoma, providing a large field for mesh placement ().\nAt the end of the procedure, the abdominal wall defect was closed with a 2-0 non-absorbable suture (). The peritoneum defect was secured using a 3-0 absorbable suture with the enterostomy loop positioned outside the peritoneum.\nA 15 × 15-cm polypropylene mesh was cut in the middle and placed around the colostomy loop (), then sutured and fixed. After a careful re-examination, the surgical field was clean, and no drainage tube was placed. Then extrapneumoperitoneum was relieved to complete the operation.\nThe total operation time was 240 min while the peritoneal separation time was 115 min. The patient was discharged 48 h after the operation. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient had a regular oral intake and defecation, no pain around the stoma, no seroma formation, and no infection at the incision site. The follow-up abdominal CT scan showed no recurrence of the hernia (). </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Upper Limit": "86.612",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 74 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 79.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 79.2 µmol. To convert 79.2 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 79.2 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 7.92e-05 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 7.92e-05 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.009 g Creatinine. To convert 0.009 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.009 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 9.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 9.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.9 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 79.2 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 0.9 mg Creatinine/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.9^(-1.154) * 74^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=82.488. Hence, the patient's GFR is 82.488 mL/min/1.73m².",

    "problem": "<Context> A 15-year-old Japanese girl with a diagnosis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was admitted to our hospital to undergo posterior spinal fusion at T4–L3. She was a high school student and did not present any symptoms at admission. She did not take any medications prior to the surgery. Her past medical, social, environmental, and family history was not appreciable. She was 147 cm tall, and her weight was 40 kg. She had a Cobb angle of 60 degrees. She had no neurological symptoms. Her temperature was 36.8 °C, her blood pressure was 118/64 mmHg, and her pulse was 92 beats per minute. Laboratory findings at admission were as follows. Her white blood cell count was 6860/μl, red blood cell count 472 × 104/μl, hemoglobin 14.3 g/dl, hematocrit 42.1%, platelets 30.8 × 104/μl, aspartate transaminase 19 IU/L, alanine transaminase 15 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, γ-glutamyl transferase 16 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 371 IU/L, total protein 8.2 g/dl, albumin 5.2 g/dl, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dl, creatinine 0.39 mg/dl, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, C-reactive protein 0.01 mg/dl, urinalysis pH 6.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, and no uric blood. No microbial examination was performed.\nWe planned general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol and a continuous infusion of remifentanil to record MEPs and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). In addition, we planned to use both bolus and continuous infusions of ketamine, followed by intravenous patient-controlled fentanyl as postoperative analgesia because we believed that ketamine did not affect MEP monitoring.\nAfter securing an intravenous line in the patient’s forearm, general anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 4 μg/ml and remifentanil 0.3 μg/kg/minute. After administration of rocuronium 20 mg, the trachea was intubated using a reinforced endotracheal tube. Thereafter, 1 g of cefazolin sodium was administered intravenously every 3 hours during the surgery and every 12 hours until postoperative day 1.\nWe started preparation for recording the MEPs and SSEPs. MEPs were evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (a train of five pulses with an interstimulus interval of 2 milliseconds; supramaximal stimulus, 400 V) with screw electrodes fixed at 2 cm anterior to C3 and C4 (cathode and anode, respectively, following the international 10–20 system). MEPs and SSEPs were recorded using an intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring system (Neuromaster MEE-1216; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). MEPs were recorded bilaterally from the abductor pollicis, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and flexor hallucis brevis muscles. SSEPs were evoked by stimulation (30 mA) of the sciatic nerve and recorded from 2 cm posterior to Cz (averaging the signals generated by 200 stimulations).\nAfter the patient was turned to a prone position, we confirmed that we could record MEPs from all targeted muscles without difficulty. We maintained general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 3.3 μg/ml and remifentanil 0.2 μg/kg/minute. The patient’s bispectral index values were below 60, and her vital signs were stable. Several minutes before the skin incision was made, the attending anesthesiologist evaluating the MEPs discovered that they were markedly attenuated (Fig. ). The attending anesthesiologist had not changed the propofol infusion rate and had not administered any other drugs except for intravenous bolus administration of ketamine 50 mg (1.25 mg/kg). Ketamine was administered about 3 minutes before the change in MEP waveforms. The patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, and body temperature remained stable. The surgery had not started at that time. About 6 minutes after administration of ketamine, the MEP amplitudes were recovered.\nThe surgery was performed uneventfully, and the patient had no neurologic deficit when she emerged from general anesthesia. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (a combination of fentanyl 25 μg/ml and ketamine 2.5 mg/ml, background infusion 1 ml/hour, bolus 1 ml, and lockout time 10 minutes) was used for postoperative pain management. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 11 without any complications.

    "problem": "<Context> A 28-year-old married housewife presented in the orthopedics outpatient department of tertiary care hospital in Central India with the chief complaints of pain in both thighs, more on the right side and difficulty in walking for the past 2 years. Pain had started spontaneously, was insidious in onset, and localized initially to both thighs. It increased with weight bearing, walking and household chores and partially got relieved on rest and medication. There was pain in elbow, wrist, and both hands for a few months initially. There was no history of fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight, or any change in menstrual cycle. Her joints’ pain and left thigh pain got completely relieved with drugs, but pain in the right thigh and hip area did not improve. She noticed progressively increasing difficulty in walking, squatting, and sitting cross-legged during the past 6 months. She started feeling rest pain in the right thigh and started taking stick support for the past 2 months. She had undergone repeated consultations, investigations, and treatment, but was not relieved of her symptoms.\nExamination revealed painful gait with minimal weight bearing on the right lower limb. The patient was thin built with mild pallor and without any systemic abnormality. Her pulse was 84/minute and blood pressure 130/70 mmHg. Tenderness was present on upper one-third of right thigh and both pubic rami with adductor muscle spasm. Right hip rotations and abduction adduction were grossly restricted with flexion possible up to 70°. Left hip movements were normal except terminal restriction of flexion. There was no neurovascular deficit. Examination of other bones and spine did not reveal any abnormality.\nA clinical diagnosis of Osteomalacia with Looser’s zone in pubic rami and incomplete fracture in right femur was considered. Metastatic lesions, multiple myeloma, or hyperparathyroidism with brown tumors were considered as differential diagnoses. The patient underwent X-rays of relevant areas. X-ray of pelvis with both hips ( and ) showed multiple small osteolytic lesions in both ilium and femur, thinning of cortices and uniting fractures in bilateral pubic rami. X-rays of both thighs ( and ) showed generalized osteoporosis, multiple lytic areas of 2–3 cm size separated with each other by a small zone of normal bone in upper one-third of shaft. There were two large osteolytic areas in the right shaft femur. The patient was admitted for prophylactic nailing in right femur in view of the impending fracture through the lytic areas (). She was given an above knee up to groin plaster slab and advised bed rest. In the left femur, the osteolytic areas were relatively smaller, cortices were thicker and there was no immediate risk of an impending fracture. Hence, fixation of left femur was not considered. X-rays of skull, chest, lumbar spine, feet, and hands did not show any obvious abnormality. Old magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thighs suspected the small lytic lesions in both femora as simple bone cyst. Fresh MRI with contrast ( and ) showed multiple intramedullary solid cystic lesions of varied size in both pubic rami, ischium, iliac blades, and upper and middle one-third of both femora probably due to browns tumor. USG of neck suggested the possibility of parathyroid adenoma of size 37 mm × 19 mm. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of neck showed well defined heterogeneously enhancing nodular mass lesion of size 33 mm × 24 mm × 23 mm just posterior to the right lobe of thyroid, suggestive of parathyroid adenoma with lytic lesions in the base of skull and in the right occipital bone. USG-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology from lytic lesion over right iliac crest showed only hemorrhagic background without any cellularity.\nPatient’s complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and urine examination were normal. She had hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism with serum calcium level of 10.78 mg/dl, PTH 1632 pg/dl, ALP 1686 IU/L, and Vitamin D3 24 ng/ml. Serum calcium, PTH, ALP, and Vitamin D3 levels done on various occasions are summarized in .\nWhile indoor, the patient tried going to bathroom and fell down, leading to fracture through the lytic area in the right proximal femur (). The fracture was surgically stabilized with long proximal femur nail and static locking (). Open biopsy from lytic lesion was done after stabilization of fracture. The biopsy showed fibro-collagenous tissue having sheets of cells with adequate amount of eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and centrally placed nucleus without any malignant features. Per-operatively, the lytic area was very soft containing reddish brown friable tissue. Bony destruction was gross causing gap in cortical continuity at pathological fracture site despite nailing. Her post-operative period was uneventful. She was transferred to surgical unit for right parathyroid adenoma excision which was done successfully. The excised adenoma was of size 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 1 cm. Its histology showed typical features of adenoma without any features of malignancy and vascular or capsular invasion (). Immediately after adenoma excision she was kept on supportive intravenous calcium supplementation to avoid hypo-calcemic crisis (Hungry bone syndrome). The post-operative protocol followed was: Static quadriceps and hamstring exercises with active hip, knee, and ankle mobilization in bed for 2 weeks. After this, bedside knee mobilization and non-weight bearing mobilization with walker was started gradually. Patient was kept non-weight bearing for 12 weeks, followed by partial weight bearing with walker. Oral calcium and Vitamin D supplementation were continued. A 3 monthly follow-up was continued for clinical, radiological and serum calcium, and PTH estimation. She became asymptomatic at 6 months with near normal serum parameters and was permitted to walk with stick support. At 1 year (), her fracture had consolidated satisfactorily; lytic lesions had almost disappeared and the patient was having full range of hip movement with normal weight bearing without support. The X-ray of left femur at 1 year is shown in . Serum calcium and PTH values had returned to normal. She conceived 1 year after the surgery and delivered a full-term normal baby. At 2 years follow-up, there is no pain in any bone, the right lower limb is shorter by 0.5 cm and her gait is normal. Patient is able to squat but has difficulty in sitting cross legged due to moderate restriction of external rotation in right hip. Nail removal is planned in a few months. The serum calcium, PTH, ALP, and Vitamin D levels are normal and majority of the brown tumors had regressed.

The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient’s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient’s temperature was 103.9°F (39.9°C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 × 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0–10.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0–18.0], platelet count of 135 × 103/mm3 [lab range 150–350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137–145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98–107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0–30.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9–20], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7–1.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70–99], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0–10]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0–0.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38–126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13–69), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15–46).

A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40–70], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12–60], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient’s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient’s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient’s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies.

The patient had a urinary tract infection, the urine culture found E coli, so he started antibiotic treatment for 10 days by quinolones (ciprofloxacin) 500 mg twice a day).\nDue to a severe penile pain, the patient was programmed for partial penectomy (a) after taking his permission as well as that of his family. In the trans-surgery, the absence of vascular flow was observed in the penile arteries and in the deep dorsal vein (b).The following management was based on a daily wound care, debridement for the next 2 weeks and an antibiotic-based treatment for a second episode of urinary tract infection. So, he received imipenem 500 mg two times per 10 day. In the first postoperative days, the patient’s state shows recovery, but from the 14th day of this intervention, the surgical wound remained open with little serohematic secretion, as well as infected tissues shows poor progression that led to Fournier’s gangrene (a). Then, a total penectomy was performed through removing a part of his left scrotum (b). An arteriography was performed during his hospital stay in the vascular department which showed multiple vascular calcifications notably at the level of the internal iliac artery and its branches. During laboratory assessment, the creatinine and urea levels in the blood were higher than the laboratory values: Creatinine 78 mg/L, urea 82.2 g/L. The other results were like the following: Serum Ca was slightly decreased to 83 mg/Land serum phosphate was high reaching 55 mg/L. In addition to that, parathyroid hormone level was not recorded, and vitamin D was deficient lowering to10.8 ng/mL. Elevated inflammatory markers were noticed including C-reactive protein and leukocytes because of his urinary tract infection. Haemoglobin (Hb) was only 7.2 g/dL due to renal anemia by end-stage renal failure. The histopathological analysis found an advanced diabetic microangiopathy accompanied by significant calcium deposits in vessels lumen with intimal fibroblastic proliferation (a and b). </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "6.382",
    "Upper Limit": "7.054",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 80 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 78.0 mg/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 78.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 7.8 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 78.0 mg Creatinine/L converts to 7.8 mg Creatinine/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 7.8^(-1.154) * 80^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=6.718. Hence, the patient's GFR is 6.718 mL/min/1.73m².",

The last cycle of chemotherapy (paclitaxel liposome combined with epirubicin) was performed on May 10, 2018. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy due to right scapular metastasis and right adrenal metastasis in April 2016 and March 2017, respectively, with no apparent discomfort. From the date of diagnosis of GC until June 2018, the patient had not used any targeted drugs and had normal blood pressure.\nThe patient was admitted to our department for review on July 16, 2018. A CT scan showed that the left adrenal metastasis was significantly greater than before. The patient refused to undergo chemotherapy. He had a Karnofsky (KPS) score of 100. Hematological indicators, including liver function, kidney function, blood cell analysis, electrolytes, and coagulation index were normal. Blood pressure was also in normal range. He was advised to use apatinib (750 mg p.o. q.d.) on July 19, 2018. He had no obvious discomforts for 7 days after oral apatinib administration, and he was discharged. Blood pressure was normal during hospitalization. The patient was advised to monitor blood pressure by daily at home, but he did not perform it. He had dizziness accompanied by weakness in both lower limbs on the evening of July 31, 2018 (12 days after oral apatinib administration). Blood pressure was 185/110 mm Hg. He was administered valsartan 80 mg. There were no any changes in his blood pressure measured 2 hours after administration of this drug, and he went to sleep. The patient was admitted in our department on the morning of August 1, 2018. Blood pressure after admission was 198/111 mm Hg. He did not use any other drugs that may cause an increase in blood pressure at home. He was instructed to discontinue apatinib use. Nifedipine controlled-release tablet 20 mg and furosemide 20 mg were administered immediately. Blood pressure was reduced to the normal range in 4 hours after drug administration. Hematological indicators, such as liver function, kidney function, blood cell analysis, electrolytes, etc were normal. Seizures, however, occurred twice during this period, and his consciousness improved after using diazepam. The patient reported vision loss on both eyes after the second seizure occurrence. Physical examination revealed that the bilateral eyeballs squinted to the left side, the size of both pupils were normal, and light reflection on both eyes was slightly dull. Brain CT scan on the afternoon of August 1 revealed bilateral basal ganglia, radial crown, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe with patchy low-density areas (Fig. ). On August 2, cranial T2-weighted MRI revealed symmetrical increased signal intensity in bilateral areas of the basal ganglia, radiation crown, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe, which was suggestive of RPLS (Fig. -I). Diffusion-weighted imaging showed no obvious abnormal signal (Fig. -ID).

At the age of 8 weeks marked failure to thrive was noticed. Initial treatment included various dietary regimens. The mother supplemented the daily fluid intake with water at the infant's demand. At 6 months of age, despite formula intake of 140–160 ml/kg/day, adequate weight gain was not achieved. Since birth, the body weight had dropped from the 90th to the 3rd percentile.\nOn admission, the patient's weight was 5710 g (3rd percentile), height was 64.5 cm (3rd percentile) and head circumference was 43 cm (20th percentile). Psychomotor development appeared normal for age. The infant's mother described recurrent episodes of constipation, a persistent moderate increase of body temperature and reported that the child had always been feeding well. During hospitalization with feeds on demand we observed an elevated fluid intake of 260 ml/kg/day and a maximum urine output of 8.9 ml/kg/h.\nLaboratory data demonstrated hypernatraemia (Na 160 mmol/L), hyperchloraemia (Cl 127 mmol/L) and a high total serum protein. The serum osmolality was elevated (339 mOsm/kg) while urine analysis showed a low to normal osmolality of 209 mOsm/kg with a low sodium concentration (<20 mmol/L). Clinical and laboratory investigations did not disclose any other abnormalities.\nAn intravenous challenge test with 0.6 μg 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (dDAVP) was performed. Urine was collected for 6 h. The patient hourly received a fluid volume equal to that of the previous hour's urine production. The patient did not reveal a decrease in urinary volume (hourly urine production remained at ≥7.5 ml/kg), and urine osmolality remained <160 mmol/L despite mild hypernatraemia (153 mmol/L) and hyperosmolality (339 mosmol/L). During the course of the test, serum osmolality and serum sodium concentration remained unchanged. Based on the lack of response to dDAVP, central diabetes insipidus was excluded. An increased serum ADH level of >30 ng/L before the dDAVP test supported the diagnosis of CNDI. Coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor did not rise within 4 h after dDAVP administration, indicating impaired functional integrity of AVPR2.\nOral treatment with indomethacin (1.2 mg/kg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (1.6 mg/kg/day) and amiloride (0.15 mg/kg/day) was started as soon as the diagnosis was established. Urine volume and laboratory parameters normalized and a normal weight gain was achieved.\nAt 2 and a half years of age, the patient has been treated with a low sodium diet (maximum sodium administration 2 mmol/kg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (1.3 mg/kg/day), amiloride (0.1 mg/kg/day) and indomethacin (1.2 mg/kg/day).

Her medical history was significant for long-standing severe anorexia nervosa, depression and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for nutritional support at another hospital. She was allergic to ciprofloxacin and penicillin and her nursing home medications included multivitamin, megestrol, ferrous sulfate, calcium carbonate, ranitidine, thiamine, folic acid, and olanzapine.\nUpon admission, her weight was 21 kg and her BMI was 7.9, which amounted to approximately 40%percnt; of her ideal body weight. The vital signs were normal. The patient was bed bound, alert and well oriented. The physical exam revealed dry skin, excoriations all over the body, brittle nails, pallor and profound emaciation with bitemporal wasting. Her abdomen was scaphoid without organomegaly, and she had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with granulation tissue surrounding the stoma. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dl, white cell count of 3.5 k/μl, platelet count of 230 k/μl, prothrombin time of 12 s and activated partial thromboplastin time of 29 s, normal serum electrolytes except for a blood sugar level of 56. Her liver function tests showed serum alanine aminotransferase of 32 units/l, serum aspartate aminotransferase of 32 units/l and serum total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dl.\nShe continued to refuse oral and tube feeding and she had intermittent episodes of hypoglycemia. She was evaluated by psychiatrists and was deemed to lack decisional capacity. It was recommended that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube feeding be imposed for nutritional support. After consultation with the nutritional team, tube feeding was begun at 400 kcal/day and advanced gradually over the next 5 days to 900 kcal/day.\nFive days after the initiation of feeding, she developed tachycardia and lab work revealed electrolyte abnormalities such as hypophosphatemia (phosphorus 0.8 mg/dl) and hypokalemia (potassium 2.9 mEq/l) (fig. ). An electrocardiogram was done, which showed sinus tachycardia with some premature ventricular complexes and prolonged QT interval (QTc 472). She was then evaluated by cardiologists and nutritional teams. A diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made, and the patient was transferred to the telemetry unit for further management. Further laboratory tests revealed elevated transaminases (alanine aminotransferase 193 units/l, aspartate aminotransferase 173 units/l), alkaline phosphatase (392 IU/l) and bilirubin (1.4 mg/dl), which were normal upon admission (fig. ). A consultation with a gastroenterologist was called. Viral hepatitis was excluded by serological tests and autoimmune workup, including anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody, antinuclear antibody and antimitochondrial antibody, was negative. Serum ceruloplasmin level was normal. Other causes of hepatitis such as hepatotoxic drugs were excluded. The liver and pancreas appeared normal on a computed tomogram. An abdominal ultrasound revealed normal echotexture of the liver without intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation and normal Doppler evaluation of the hepatic and portal vein blood flow.\nInfusions of potassium phosphate and magnesium sulfate were administered in addition to oral potassium phosphate supplements. Intravenous thiamine was given. Her enteral intake was reduced and daily electrolyte levels were obtained along with regular monitoring of the liver function tests.

He also had a headache for the last month. The pain was dull, localized to the scalp, and the occipital region occurring usually in the morning and lasted for a few hours. The pain was relieved by taking an analgesic. He was in the normal state of health before one month. On initial evaluation, the temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, heart rate was 91 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20/minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient was healthy and appeared oriented and alert with intact cognition. His skin, extremities, and pulses were normal. However, the patient was anxious with frequent blinking of eyes. On neurological examination, his power, and coordination, and gait were intact, and his toes were down going. The sensation was intact bilaterally, and the reflexes were intact on both sides of the body. His cranial nerve examination was also unremarkable except ophthalmic nerve and eye examination. The patient was noted to have strabismus and diplopia. There was no evident deformity on his face or eye, and he did not have any muscle weakness. He had no history of previous trauma or fall.\nImaging studies were performed, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a homogenous hyperdense and enhancing mass in the pineal region (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent endoscopic biopsy of the pineal region, which demonstrated cells with highly pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei. A significant increase in mitotic activity was detected. There were many vessels but no area of vascular proliferation and necrosis. Granular bodies with eosinophilia were identified. Immunohistochemistry was positive for class III b-tubulin with epidermal growth factor receptor staining (EGFR) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

    "problem": "<Context> A 43-year-old man, working in a furniture company with no medical history, was accidentally penetrated by a wooden stick during his routine factory touring. He was immediately taken to the emergency department of the local hospital by ambulance. Feeling tearing anguish in the left flank, the patient was dysphoric and drenched in sweat. On physical examination, he was hemodynamically stable (blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg) and tachypneic (respiratory rate, 30 times/minute). There was a solitary entrance wound in the left flank, with a stick penetrated in and continuing blood leakage (Fig. ). Urethral catheter was inserted and no gross hematuria was observed.\nLaboratory tests revealed microscopic hematuria, mildly elevated leucocyte and amylase, normal hemoglobin (145 g/L) and creatinine (1.05 mg/dl). Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in the local hospital, which demonstrated bilateral penetrating renal injuries with perinephric/subcapsular hematoma, fracture of the second lumbar vertebra and 10th rib. Neither pleural injury nor lung injury was observed. The stick went through the left kidney, the anterior body of the second lumbar vertebra and bilateral psoas muscle, terminating in the right renal parenchyma (Fig. ). Fortunately, there was still a distance between the stick and ventral aorta and inferior vena cava. However, there was concern that any displacement of the wedge-shaped stick might cause life-threatening hemorrhage.\nOwing to the intractability of this case, the patient was transported to our hospital. An emergency exploratory laparotomy with the midline abdominal incision was performed immediately. We used a self-retaining retractor to obtain satisfactory visibility. After clamping the left renal pedicle, we slowly pulled out the stick according to its penetrating path on CT scan. The hilum of the left kidney was transected, and the collecting system was seriously damaged and contaminated, with extensive parenchymal and vascular injuries. It was considered a grade V injury according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale grading system (Table ). Since the left kidney was shattered beyond repair, we decided to excise it totally. Then we explored the right kidney and found an approximately 2.0 cm posterior laceration in the inferior pole, without urinary extravasation. It was deemed a grade III injury according to the AAST grading system. After washing out the sawdust and sterilizing the laceration with 0.5% iodophor, we meticulously performed renorrhaphy of the right kidney. Then the abdominal cavity was explored and no intestinal injury was found. The fracture of the second lumbar vertebra was handled by spine surgeons. Intraperitoneal drainages were routinely placed on both sides and the laceration of the left flank was repaired. During the operation, four units of packed red blood cells were transfused. Tetanus antitoxin and piperacillin and tazobactam were injected to prevent tetanus and bacterial infection. The patient was transferred to surgical intensive care unit for resuscitation.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. There was approximately 2000 mL of urine for the next 24 hours postoperatively. Postoperative chest radiograph revealed slight exudation of bilateral lungs. Eleven days after the surgery, the patient recovered well and discharged with no complications.

    "problem": "<Context> A 10-kg, 1-year-old boy underwent craniofacial surgery at an Australian children’s hospital. Postoperatively, he had a number of issues in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) (). The issues included difficulties in managing pain with variable pain scores using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale ranging from 0 to 6. During the postoperative period, the infant had an episode of over-sedation with a sedation score of 3, using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), which required opiate reversal with naloxone. In addition, he had decreased oxygen saturation, declining to 70% at one point and increased work of breathing. The infant was given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A chest X-ray showed changes consistent with either atelectasis or aspiration, which required antibiotic treatment. The infant had a nasopharyngeal airway in situ.\nFollowing these issues, the anaesthetist wrote progress notes, recommending that the intravenous (IV) morphine infusion should be maintained at the conservative dose of 10 µg/kg/h without bolus or halved if there were further sedation issues. However, he wrote an opioid infusion order in the range of 10–40 µg/kg/h, with a 10 µg/kg bolus (1 mL) of intervals no less than 10 min for pain. One ward nurse retrieved the patient from the PACU at 21:00, and a night duty nurse took over care at 21:30. Overnight, the infant was unsettled and breath-holding and was given a number of boluses of IV morphine and then the morphine infusion dose was doubled. The infant was reviewed by the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) Outreach Team at 02:30, who made no changes to the treatment plan.\nAt 7:30, the same nurse who collected the infant from recovery was caring for him again. The specialist surgical team reviewed him shortly after. They suggested to the nurse that the nasopharyngeal airway could be ‘corked’ or spigotted and documented in the progress notes that the general medical team would review the infant regarding the changes on chest X-ray results, and that the pain management service would review analgesia. It was not documented whether these reviews were also verbally handed over to those teams. The infant was reviewed by the pain management service at 11:05 and at that time the infant appeared settled, with pain scores of 0–1. The pain management service documented a plan to continue the morphine infusion at 20 µg/kg/h but to wean it later in the day and to manage pain with regular oral paracetamol and ibuprofen. At 11:10, his distress escalated and his pain score was documented as 5/10 by the nurse. By 11:25, the infant remained unsettled and as no other analgesia was due, a 10 µg/kg (1 mL) bolus of IV morphine was given with some effect and the infant was asleep after 10 min. At 11:55, the nurse contacted the surgical team’s junior doctor regarding the updated medication recommendation. Still asleep, his nasopharyngeal airway was then corked, resulting in an increased work of breathing but no decrease in oxygen saturation. Upon awakening, the infant’s pain score was 1, and sedation score was 1. The nurse administered IV tramadol 2 mg/kg (20 mg dose) at 12:30; however, the work of breathing remained high and the nasopharyngeal airway was un-corked. His oxygen saturation began to drop to mid-80%, and increasing supplemental oxygen therapy had little effect. The nurse paged the surgical team twice at 13:03 and 13:18 with no response. The Associate Unit Manager (AUM) attempted to call the surgical team at 13:23, also to no avail. There was no attempt to contact the medical or pain teams.\nAt 13:25, a medical emergency team (MET) call was made. When the team arrived, the infant had increased work of breathing, an oxygen saturation of 70%, and an audible stridor. The team immediately ceased the morphine infusion and gave sodium chloride (0.9%) nebuliser via a mask. A stat. dose of 6 mg IV dexamethasone was administered. Oxygen saturation improved to around 90% with a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min. An adrenaline nebuliser was given followed by 10 mg of IV parecoxib. The surgical team arrived during the MET call and when over-sedation was suggested, a senior doctor stated that he had explicitly asked that the morphine was to be ceased earlier in the day. This request had not been mentioned to the primary nurse and was not documented in the infant’s file.\nA chest X-ray showed right lung changes, suggestive of aspiration. An arterial blood gas revealed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. At 13:50, 100 µg of IV naloxone was given (10 µg/kg), resulting in deeper breathing and large cough-clearing, thick secretions. Vital signs improved with an increased oxygen saturation of 95%. Following the MET intervention and management, the infant remained stable and pain was subsequently managed with paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol, along with deep suction every 30 min, humidified oxygen, and regular medical review. Two days after surgery, he was still noted to have an increased work of breathing with a nasopharyngeal airway in situ. His oxygen supplementation was gradually weaned and the nasopharyngeal airway was successfully removed 3 days following surgery, and he was discharged from hospital 4 days after surgery. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

At the same time, he started to present gross hematuria, back pain and headache. At admission, laboratory analysis showed increase in serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl together with hematuria and mild proteinuria (1 g/24 h). Intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation (piperacillin/tazobacatam and colimycin) were started and a renal biopsy performed to investigate the cause of hematuria and renal failure. Biopsy was consistent with IgAN (see Fig. ), with morphological features of mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity (Oxford classification M1, E1, S0, T0) [] As the patient presented dyspepsia, he was offered upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies (one from duodenal bulb and three from descending duodenum). Duodenal mucosa was reported as normal on hematoxylin/eosin stain. While compatible HLA alleles for celiac disease (DQ2) were identified, both serum anti-endomysium (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) were negative. It has been demonstrated that coeliac IgA targets intestinal TG2 early in disease development even when serum celiac autoantibodies are not present. Extraintestinal deposits of coeliac IgA further indicate that humoral immunity may have a pathogenetic role []. Therefore, double immunofluorescence on duodenal mucosa was performed to detect mucosal deposits of anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 using the technique described by Karponay-Szabo et al., with some modification []. Briefly, 5 μm sections from the duodenal specimen included in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound were obtained and stored at − 80° in liquid nitrogen. Sections were fixed in acetone and incubated with Normal Rabbit Serum (Calbiochem Germany) for 20 min to block nonspecific sites. Sections were then incubated with anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 (anti-tTG-2) from mouse (CUB7402 from Neomarker, Fremont CA) for one hour, and then with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorochromes to detect total IgA (in green using Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Human IgA/FICT from Dako, Denmark) and anti-tTG-2 (in red using Polyconal Rabbit anti-Mouse RPE F (ab’) 2 from Dako, Denmark) for 30 min. The overlap of green and red (yellow) indicates the deposits of anti-tTG2. Analysis was performed on confocal microscopy. The same technique was performed on 5 μm renal sections. In both cases, an overlap of green and red in yellow was seen, thus demonstrating deposits of tTG-2 (Fig. , and ). In particular, in renal biopsies, deposits of tTG-2 that topographically replicated mesangial deposits of IgA (Fig. ) were detected.\nGiven the morphological features of IgAN, and the presence of proteinuria, steroid therapy was started according to a standardized six month’s protocol []. After one month, proteinuria decreased to 100 mg/24 h and hematuria resolved. Steroids were stopped after six months of treatment. The patient continued on a gluten containing diet.\nConsidering that intestinal deposits of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA are predictive of forthcoming enteropathy [] after one year arepeat upper endoscopy was performed even though anti-tTG were still negative. At this time, a Marsh 2 type duodenal pathology was detected (Fig. , ). A gluten free diet was started (for a complete timeline history see Additional file : Table S1). </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 98.4 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 66.4 = 36.889 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 99.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 9.8 count/L. To convert 9.8 count/L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0 L/m^3 which will give 9.8 white blood cell count/L * 1000.0 L/m^3 = 9800.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 30.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 1 + 1 = 2 criteria met.

She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2015 and underwent left-sided colectomy and then was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] for a total of 6 cycles). In 2018, she developed left lower extremity edema and was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis of the left femoral vein and left great saphenous vein and was placed on rivaroxaban. Extensive workup showed metastatic disease to the lungs, adrenal glands, and pelvic lymph nodes. Biopsy of one of the nodes confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon. She was started on the combination of capecitabine 1000 mg twice a day (day 1 to day 14 every 21 days) and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg (day 1 every 21 days) and received the first dose of bevacizumab 1 week after starting capecitabine; she has never been on those drugs before. Less than 24 hours after the bevacizumab dose, she started having a dyspnea on exertion that was worsening and was associated with a dry cough and fatigue.\nShe was tachycardic and tachypneic on admission (heart rate was 122 bpm, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min). Her blood pressure was 163/110 mm Hg. Her Sao2 was 84% on room air. She was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for respiratory distress with minimal improvement on oxygen delivery therapies. Stat arterial blood gas showed acute hypoxic respiratory failure (pH of 7.26, Pco2 of 47, Po2 of 248, HCO3 of 21). She was subsequently intubated and required intensive care.\nHer admission blood work was significant for mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 13.42/μL, with 82% neutrophils) (see ). Chest radiograph showed bilateral basilar opacities (see ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast redemonstrated bilateral airspace opacities with a slight central distribution (see ).\nShe was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of multifocal pneumonia. All cultures and gram stains for infectious etiologies including common bacteria, fungi, legionella, viruses, and Pneumocystis were negative. Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued when cultures came back negative; patient received antibiotics a total of 5 days. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and cytological examination of BAL fluid sample showed rare mildly atypical cells; it favored reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and bronchial cells in a background of marked acute inflammation. Cultures of BAL were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungal pathogens. Pneumocystis jiroveci was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, a grade I diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. On day 6 of hospitalization, the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg given every 8 hours with the aim to treat presumed interstitial pneumonitis. Subsequently, the patient’s condition improved significantly, and she was extubated within 2 days of corticosteroid therapy initiation. Post-extubation, bilevel positive airway pressure–assisted ventilation was used as needed and she was subsequently transitioned to daily oral prednisone 40 mg. Arterial blood gas analysis on 3 L nasal cannula then showed a pH of 7.54, Pco2 of 38, Po2 of 159 and an oxygen saturation of 98%. Chest radiograph on discharge showed partial resolution of the bibasilar opacities (see ). Eventually, the patient was discharged after 3 weeks on therapeutic subcutaneous enoxaparin and long-term oxygen therapy as needed with a gradual taper of steroid. She eventually signed a Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate form and was put on hospice care.

    "Upper Limit": "7.0",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 0 + 3 = 3. The patient's heart rate is 122.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 4.5. Because the patient has previously been diagnosed for pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 6.0. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be present and so one point is added to the score, making the total score 6.0 + 1 =  7.0.

    "problem": "<Context> A 62 year old Caucasian female patient (height - 1.60 m, weight 72 kg, BMI 28.1) was admitted to hospital with AKI (patient’s baseline serum creatinine was 85 μmol/L and eGFR was 63 ml/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD equation) whilst on treatment for mastoiditis. Her background medical history included hypertension, and type 2 diabetes for which she was on regular sitagliptin-metformin 50/1000 mg half tablet twice a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. She had a long medical history of recurrent otitis media for which she required grommet insertion. She was managed as outpatient with topical and oral ciprofloxacin by her otolaryngologist. Trial of oral trimethoprim-sulphamethaxazole (Bactrim DS) was prescribed without much clinical improvement. Eight weeks prior to this admission, she had symptoms of earache, localised post auricular swelling and fever. A CT scan showed mastoiditis and a contiguous subperiosteal abscess. A brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and Technetium 99 m labelled bone scan which revealed osteomyelitis (OM) of the petrous temporal bone (Figure ). She underwent an emergency cortical mastoidectomy with drainage of the abscess and insertion of a new right ear grommet. Empirical therapy with ticarcillin-clavulanate (12.4 grams/day) was commenced.\nA surface swab from the ear isolated Escherichia coli (which was sensitive to ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime and gentamicin, but resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin). Susceptibilities were done using Vitek2 (Biomerieux, Marcy l’Etolie, France) using standard Gram negative card. Based on the antibiogram the isolate most likely had underlying extended spectrum beta lactamase, although confirmatory testing was not done as per current testing policy (non-sterile site isolate). The operative specimens of pus and tissue taken at the time of surgery remained sterile. Her antibiotic was changed to cefepime (6 grams/day).\nShe made good progress and was discharged with a plan of continuing cefepime for 6 weeks as treatment of OM on ambulatory care basis. After 2 weeks of therapy, she developed malaise and dysgeusia. At 4 weeks, she developed renal impairment (serum creatinine-140 μmol/L) and the cefepime dose was reduced to 4 grams/day. Her blood pressure at time was 130/82 mmHg. There was no fever, rash or peripheral oedema. Urine analysis done by automated iQ200 (Iris Diagnostics, Chatsworth, CA) machine and manual phase contrast microscopy showed WBC of <10 × 106 /L, no RBC and no presence of either WBC/RBC casts. 24 hour urine collection (of 2.47 L) had proteinuria of 0.77 g/day (normal range-0.08-0.15 g/day). C reactive protein was 3 mg/L (normal < 5 mg/L). At week 5 into therapy, she was noted to have worsening AKI (serum creatinine 225 μmol/L) and was admitted for further investigation (Figure ). She suffered the ‘injury stage’ of AKI according to Risk Injury Failure Loss of kidney function and End stage renal failure (RIFLE) criteria and stage 3 of Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classification at admission []. At this stage she was also noted to have serum potassium of 6.1 mmol/L (range 3.5-5 mmol/L) ,serum sodium of 148 mmol/L (range 135-145 mmol/L), serum chloride was 90 mmol/L (range 97-107 mmol/L) and blood urea of 15 mmol/L (range 2.5-7.5 mmol/L). There were no new medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chinese herbal supplements or any other form of naturotherapy that were taken by her.\nDuring her inpatient stay all medications except metoprolol were ceased. Though she was clinically euvolaemic and suffered from non-oliguric renal failure, 36 hours trial of intravenous hydration with normal saline (0.9% w/v) at 80 ml/hour was administered with minimal effect on serum creatinine, blood urea and serum electrolytes. Marginal increase of urine output was noted which was commensurate with the intravenous fluid administered. Laboratory investigations of aetiology of AKI were negative or not detected. This included: Double stranded DNAs, ANCA, extractable nuclear antigens, rheumatoid factor, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, complement levels, immunoglobulin subclasses, streptococcal serology and hepatitis B and C serology. An ANA titre of 1:1280 (homogenous pattern) was noted and was thought to be related as a reaction due to cefepime therapy. Renal ultrasound revealed normal renal size, parenchyma and no obstructive uropathy. A renal biopsy showed moderate tubular atrophy with many intra-tubular casts in the medullary area. A few tubules were distended with cellular debris and acute inflammatory exudate (acute tubulitis). Moderate interstitial fibrosis was present with patchy areas of inflammatory infiltrates comprising predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Eosinophils were not detected in the renal biopsy. Periodic acid Schiff stain and Gomori -silver stain were negative on the biopsy. Immunofluorescence staining was negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C1q, C3, amyloid and fibrinogen. Electron microscopy did not reveal any glomerular abnormality. (Figure )\nIt was concluded that this patient had drug-induced AIN, most likely related to cefepime. Cessation of the antibiotic led to a rapid improvement in her renal function over a week and therefore it was decided to treat her conservatively. The serum creatinine dropped from 295 μmol/L to 170 μmol/L within a week and then continued to trend downwards reaching up to 150 μmol/L on her 2 weekly follow-up post discharge. Her symptoms of malaise and dysgeusia had also abated at this visit. All the electrolytes (sodium, potassium and chloride) including blood urea were within normal ranges at this stage. Corticosteroid was not administered due to partially treated infection, diabetes and rapid improvement in renal function after cessation of antibiotics.\nFor completion of therapy (another 2 weeks) oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily was commenced, mindful of the fact that the isolate was resistant to ciprofloxacin with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 4 mg/L. Following discharge from hospital, she remained asymptomatic and continued to improve from her infection perspective. Sitagliptin-metformin, lisinopril and simvastatin were slowly reintroduced over the next 3 months after discharge while her renal function continued to improve.\nTable shows the temporal trend in the biochemical parameters including serum creatinine and eGFR. Although serum creatinine has plateaued, mild renal impairment still exists at 8 months of follow-up (serum creatinine of 130 μmol/L and eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2).\nThis adverse drug reaction has been recorded permanently in her electronic medical records and also has been reported to Australian Therapeutic goods administration (TGA). </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

The echocardiography showed mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, normal ventricular wall motion and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The medical history included end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis for 6 years, diabetic gangrene of right foot for 5 months. Indication for pacemaker implantation was established according to the ECG results, in order to prevent transvenous pocket inflammation or systemic inflammation from the gangrenous foot, the Micra leadless pacemaker (Medtronic, Inc. Minneapolis, USA) was recommended and the informed consent was approved by the patient.\nThe right femoral vein was successfully punctured and inserted with a 6 French sheath, and a bolus of 3000 IU unfractionated heparin (UFH) was intravenous administrated at the beginning of the procedure. The access site was gradually dilated by 8- and 12-French dilators, and a 23-French delivery sheath was introduced into the inferior vena cava, then the pacemaker delivery catheter was connected to the sheath. All delivery devices were flushed and connected with heparinized saline properly. The Micra pacemaker was advanced and conducted into the mid-septum of right ventricle and the fluoroscopic location was acceptable. However, electrical measurement showed a low sensing amplitude of only 2.8 mV, suggesting that the pacemaker needed to be repositioned again.\nFor recapture, the tether connected to the handle was pulled with constant tension and the pacemaker was closed to the recapture cone, different fluoroscopic angles were viewed to confirm the devices were coaxial. Since then the delivery cup could not be advanced due to great resistance, the pacemaker was not able to be withdrew into the catheter (Fig. , Additional file ). Finally, the whole delivery catheter had to be removed from the delivery sheath (Fig. , Additional file ).\nLuckily no valvular or myocardial tissues were found at the tip of the catheter, instead the lumen was fully filled with heavy thrombi (Fig. ). An instant ACT level of 104 s revealed that procedural anticoagulant therapy was insufficient, thus, additional 4000 IU (a total amount of 7000 IU) UFH was administrated immediately and the ACT level turned to 248 s 10 min later. After being removed all the thrombi the structure and mobility of the delivery catheter recovered (Fig. ), which in turn proved that the failure of recapture was caused by the thrombi within the lumen. For preventing thromboembolism, a new pacemaker system was applied and successfully implanted. The final electrical measurement was satisfied: pacing threshold was 0.5 V at 0.24 ms, sensing amplitude was 7.9 mV, and pacing impedance was 560 Ω.

She had undergone radical hysterectomy for uterine cervical cancer and received post-operative concurrent chemoradiation therapy 13 years previously. After a 5-year follow-up period, there was no evidence of the disease state and the patient was asymptomatic, and thus, regular follow-up was discontinued. At the time of admission, she had a 20 pack-year smoking history and consumed 1-2 bottles of alcohol per day, 3-4 times per week. Four days before admission, she visited another hospital with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension of 7 days duration that started after drinking. Physician recommended admission because of the presence of features of acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 78mg/dL, creatinine: 4.9mg/dL), but she refused. Four days after discharge, she was admitted at the emergency department of our hospital due to aggravation of her symptoms. She had an acute ill-looking appearance, and her blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature were 153/112mmHg, 109 pulses per minute, 20 per minute, and 36.6℃, respectively. She complained of general weakness, anorexia, weight loss (6 kg per 1 month), abdominal pain and distension, oliguria, and generalized edema. Physical examination revealed a dry tongue and skin. Chest auscultation showed a regular heart beat without murmur and clear breath sounds without crackle. She had moderate abdominal distension with hypoactive bowel sounds, and mild direct and rebound tenderness of the whole abdomen without organomegaly or a palpable mass. She had edematous lower legs but there was no definite pre-tibial pitting edema. Laboratory findings were as follows: BUN 162.9 mg/dL (reference range, 7.8-26), creatinine 7.74 mg/dL (0.3-1.2), pH 7.24, HCO3- 11.6mmol/L, pCO2 28 mmHg, sodium 119mEq/L, potassium 6.1mEq/L, serum osmolality 313mOsm/Kg. Complete blood cell count results showed mild leukocytosis (13,600/mm3 with 90% neutrophils), elevated hemoglobin (16.5 g/dL), and a normal platelet count. Liver function and coagulation battery tests were normal. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast media showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and a large amount of ascites but no evidence of liver cirrhosis (). During hospitalization, her urine output was less than 500mL per day and her renal function, including hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, were not improved by conservative management. Hemodialysis was performed for 2 days after admission, but oliguria was not improved. Paracentesis showed no evidence of malignancy or infection. Cell count and chemistry of ascites were as follows: RBC 2/mm3, WBC 42/mm3, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count 11%, glucose 152mg/dL, protein <1.0 g/dL, LDH 25U/L, BUN and creatinine level were not evaluated. On the third hospital day, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy catheters were inserted, a large amount of urine was drained, her creatinine level decreased dramatically (2 and 4 days after catheter insertions creatinine levels were 1.45 and 0.73mg/dL, respectively), and ascites decreased simultaneously without additional paracentesis. Contrast enhanced CT showed improved hydronephrosis and ascites without evidence of malignancy or an obstructing stone. To determine the cause of the obstruction and to resolve the obstruction by D-J stent insertion, retrograde pyelography was performed.

The cause of her end-stage renal disease was chronic pyelonephritis. Six weeks prior to her admission, her immunosuppressant regimen was switched from oral cyclosporine (100 mg, twice daily) to oral sirolimus (1 mg, twice daily) with a diagnosis of chronic allograft nephropathy (serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL). Her mycophenolate mofetil dose was decreased from 2000 to 1000 mg/day and prednisolone was continued with the previous dose (5 mg, daily). Four weeks later, she developed a mild cough, weakness and anorexia. Her condition progressed to a more constant cough and weight loss until she was hospitalized.\nPhysical examination revealed her blood pressure to be 110/60 mm/Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse rate 92/min and body temperature 38°C. A chest examination revealed fine crackles mainly on her lower lung fields. On admission, the laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 5.1 × 109/L, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 22.4%, mean corpuscular volume 75 fL (normal range, 77-97 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 24 pgm (normal range, 26-32 pgm), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 32% (normal, 32-36%), platelet count 213 × 109/L, fasting blood glucose 105 mg/dL, blood urea 62 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase 37 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 45 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 1106 IU/L and total bilirubin 1 mg/dL. A urine analysis was unremarkable.\nOn the first day of admission, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued and cyclosporine (200 mg/day) was started. The dose of prednisolone was not altered (5 mg, daily). A chest X-ray showed fine miliary nodules throughout the entire lung fields. Echocardiography revealed normal pericardium and cardiac chambers. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. An ultrasound examination of her renal allograft did not reveal any pathologic finding. A 6 mm induration was observed on a TB skin test. Sputum and bronchial aspirate examination was positive for acid-fast bacilli, suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan illustrated widespread miliary nodules throughout the lung fields, compatible with miliary TB (Figure ).\nIn the evening of her fourth day of admission, our patient developed an increasing right lower quadrant abdominal pain spreading to her entire abdomen. Physical examination revealed widespread abdominal tenderness and rebound. An ultrasonographic study of her abdomen disclosed a small fluid collection in the right lower quadrant. Two cysts were detected in her left ovary (54 × 32 mm and 33 × 31 mm). An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast revealed that her pancreas and spleen were normal. Her colonic wall thickness was measured as 4 mm and free fluid was visible in dependent parts of her abdominal cavity. Her peritoneal cavity was then opened with a midline incision and widespread peritonitis was found. Her inflamed appendix (9 × 6 cm) was perforated at its tip. Her ileocecal area and cecum were inflamed with fragile tissues. A cecostomy was performed and a drain was placed. Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed caseating epithelioid granulomas, epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans giant cells in the sub-mucosa and sub-serosa of her appendix (Figure ). The histological picture, along with positive mycobacterial cultures from the sputum and bronchial aspirate, was suggestive of tuberculous appendicitis. After surgery, chemotherapy for TB was started and continued for nine months. An immunosuppressive regimen was continued with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. During follow-up visits, the pulmonary and abdominal signs and symptoms were resolved. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "283.077",
    "Upper Limit": "312.875",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mEq. To convert from 135.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 135.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 135.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 135.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 135.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 62.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 105.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 135.0 + (62.0 / 2.8) + (62.0 / 18) = 297.976 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 297.976 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 297.976 mOsm/kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 36-year-old Caucasian male, with a past medical history of bilateral lung transplant for cystic fibrosis in 2017 complicated by a rejection episode, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, hypertension, pancreatic insufficiency, anxiety, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, and peripheral neuropathy presented with an 18-month history of progressive muscle weakness. The patient had a double lung transplant three years prior to the start of the muscle weakness. He had excellent exercise performance from a few months post-transplant, riding a road bike regularly and even participating in the Transplant Olympics. He experienced an episode of rejection about three years and three months after his initial transplant and required treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin. Although lung function was reduced after his rejection episode, he was still biking regularly up to 15 miles at a time. A few months after this episode of rejection, he developed some peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and therapy with pregabalin at a dose of 100 mg twice daily was initiated. Weakness started within two months after pregabalin therapy was initiated and slowly progressed. He was no longer able to ride a bike and had difficulty rising from a squatted position, or standing up from a chair. He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, peripheral edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal dyspnea. There were no symptoms of hypothyroidism and thyroid function was normal. His daily medications included mycophenolate, tacrolimus, prednisone, pregabalin azithromycin, pramipexole, ursodiol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, omeprazole, oxycodone, ativan, melatonin, simethicone, calcium, sertraline, Humalog insulin, pancrelipase, magnesium oxide, methylcobalamin, a multivitamin tablet, and tramadol on an as-needed basis.\nVital signs included a blood pressure of 120/82, a heart rate of 67, a respiratory rate of 18, and a temperature of 99 F. He weighed 76.6 kilograms with a BMI of 21.6, his oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. His general build and nourishment were normal, his fingernails showed mild clubbing. His neurological exam showed the presence of mild proximal muscle weakness; His heart had a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Peripheral pulses were normal. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated level of creatinine kinase and raised AST and ALT levels. The patient's pulmonary function tests showed a mild decrease in his FEV1 and FVC which subsequently improved while his muscle fatigue continued to worsen. A bronchoscopy performed to investigate his reduced exercise tolerance showed some purulent secretions and cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus. Biopsy performed showed no evidence of rejection (ISHLT Grade A0, B0). Repeat labs drawn the next month showed a persistently elevated creatinine kinase level (Figure ).\nA muscle biopsy was subsequently performed for further assessment. It showed scattered degenerating and necrotic muscle fibers with an associated macrophage infiltrate and phagocytic response. A prominent acute neutrophilic or chronic lymphocytic inflammatory reaction was not seen and centrally vacuolated myofibers were not identified. Taken together with the clinical history, these histologic findings were consistent with a drug-induced acute necrotizing myopathy (Figure ).\nUpon reviewing the patient's medication for potential causes, mycophenolate and tacrolimus were viewed as the most likely causative agents, and the decision made to switch to cyclosporine and sirolimus. The patient did not report any improvement in his symptoms over a three-month time period. Creatinine kinase levels continued to rise despite the change in his medication regimen and the patient grew increasingly despondent. The decision was made to discontinue pregabalin. The patient noted a dramatic improvement in muscle weakness over the next few weeks and the creatinine kinase levels improved from 1023 U/L to 256 U/L (normal range: 49-320 U/L) within a month time period.

Family history was significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her initial vital signs were as follows: heart rate 82/min, blood pressure 135/84 mmHg, 96% on room air, and afebrile. Physical examination was significant for diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. Cardiovascular examination revealed S1/S2 heart sounds with no murmur gallop or rub. The patient had no jugular vein distention (JVD), peripheral pulses were intact and no cyanosis, clubbing or edema was noted. Initial imaging including a chest X-ray and CT angiogram chest was negative for acute abnormality.\nIn the emergency department, the patient received nebulization with albuterol and intravenous steroids resulting in alleviation of symptoms. The patient was admitted to the medical floor for further management of acute asthma exacerbation. Over the course of hospitalization, patient’s breathing gradually worsened to the point of requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) as the arterial blood gas revealed acute respiratory acidosis.\nThe patient was adequately treated with BIPAP resulting in normalization of her arterial blood gases (ABGs) as well as her clinical respiratory status, but her Troponin I continued to trend up to 0.48 ng/ml two hours after her admission, then 2.22 ng/ml eight hours after admission and finally 4.08 ng/ml 11 hours after her admission.

A male neonate, weighing 2.650 g, was delivered by elective C-section at 36 weeks’ gestation. Immediately after birth, he developed a mild pneumothorax with respiratory distress requiring nasal CPAP. Initial serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dl. An initial attempt at transurethral catheterization using a 6 Fr Foley catheter was unsuccessful due to excessive resistance felt halfway through the urethra, and was followed by a self-limiting urethral bleeding. A 5 Fr umbilical catheter was therefore used to drain the bladder. Postnatal ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged and thick-walled bladder, associated with mild bilateral hydronephrosis, a dysplastic right kidney, and multiple small cysts with cortical subcapsular distribution in the contralateral left kidney. The umbilical catheter slipped out of the bladder after 72 h and was eventually replaced with a 6 Fr Foley catheter. On day-of-life 14, he was deemed fit enough to undergo VCUG. The test revealed a trabeculated bladder associated with a moderate posterior urethral dilatation and left-sided grade III vesicoureteral reflux. After catheter withdrawal, a good urinary stream and complete bladder emptying were documented during micturition (). The baby was ultimately discharge home on day-of-life 17, with a relatively stable renal function. Repeat VCUG at 9 months disclosed a less irregular bladder contour, gradual shrinking of the posterior urethral dilatation, and reflux disappearance. The bladder emptied rapidly, and postvoid residual urine volume was small. He is now 2 years old and, following a first episode of urinary tract infection, had undergone second look cystoscopy that ruled out obstructing residual valves.

    "problem": "<Context> A 6-year-old girl 102 cm tall and weighing 17 kg, with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction was scheduled for multivisceral organ transplantation. Four-years earlier, she visited a hospital for abdominal distention and was diagnosed with gastric volvulus and congenital megacolon, for which she underwent gastropexy and segmental resection of the transverse colon. Since her symptoms did not improve over the next year, she was referred to our center and underwent a transverse colostomy. After that, she was repeatedly hospitalized and maintained on total parenteral nutrition due to continuously recurring mechanical ileus, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance. Two months before surgery, she was admitted due to abdominal distension and a malfunctioning colostomy. The colostomy function was normalized 2 days later, and she received conservative medical care, including total parenteral nutrition.\nThe patient was scheduled for multivisceral organ transplantation, including seven abdominal organs, the liver, spleen, stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon and pancreas. Cadaveric donor was 5-year-old female 110 cm tall and weighed 21 kg, who had brain death due to increased intracranial pressure caused by medulloblastoma. Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution was used as preservation solution and ischemic time was 170 min. Intraoperative gross finding of the grafts showed no significant abnormality. The recipient was not premedicated and arrived at the operating room with her father. Her blood pressure was 120/64 mmHg, her heart rate was 120 beats/min, and her oxygen saturation on pulse oxymetry was 100% before induction of anesthesia. Pre-operative blood laboratory data were within normal ranges, including hemoglobin (9.4 g/dl), Na+ (142 mmol/L), K+ (3.7 mmol/L), creatinine (0.34 mg/dl), aspartate transaminase (AST; 43 IU/L), alanine transaminase (ALT; 35 IU/L), total bilirubin (0.5 mg/dl), albumin (4.4 g/dl), and prothrombin time (1.00 INR). Anesthesia was induced with 75 mg of pentothal sodium, 15 mg of rocuronium, and 50 µg of fentanyl. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 1% sevoflurane in 50% oxygen in air and continuous infusion of fentanyl (100 µg/h) and vecuronium (2 mg/h). Her brachial artery was cannulated for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter was inserted into her right internal jugular vein and a second into her subclavian vein to monitor central venous pressure and venous oxygen saturation. Femoral venous pressure was also monitored. Ten minutes before graft reperfusion, her vital signs and arterial gas analysis were as follows; mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was 86 mmHg, heart rate was 90 bpm, central venous pressure was 4 mmHg, femoral venous pressure was 16 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7℃, pH was 7.32 with a base excess of -9.5 mEq/L, arterial lactate concentration was 5.6 mmol/L, Na+ was 142 mmol/L, K+ was 2.5 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.83 mmol/L, hemoglobin was 10.8 g/dl, and blood glucose was 98 mg/dl.\nAfter injection of 20 mEq of NaHCO3, graft reperfusion was performed. Just after reperfusion, MAP rapidly decreased to 39 mmHg. Femoral venous pressure decreased after IVC unclamping from 16 mmHg to 4 mmHg and central venous pressure was maintained around 4 mmHg. Because the decrease of arterial pressure was too severe to expect spontaneous recovery and met the definition of PRS (≥ 30% decrease in MAP occurring within 5 minutes after reperfusion and lasting for at least 1 minute). She was immediately administered 5 µg of epinephrine, resulting in an MAP of 44 mmHg. However, repeated injections of 10 µg epinephrine and volume replacement were required to increase her MAP due to prolonged hypotension. Hypotension was sustained over 10 minutes, during which her averaged arterial pressure was 38 mmHg despite intermittent surge of MAP > 60 mmHg (). Arterial blood gas analysis 5 minutes after reperfusion showed severe metabolic acidosis, with a arterial blood pH of 7.09 with a base excess of -17.9 mEq/L, and the arterial lactate concentration was 8.5 mmol/L, K+ was 4.8 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.84 mmol/L, glucose was 114 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 8.5 g/dl. To correct metabolic acidosis and hypotension, she was immediately and repeatedly injected with 30 mEq of NaHCO3 and 10 µg of epinephrine. Her body temperature had decreased to 33.4℃ just after reperfusion, with hypothermia sustained for 30 min (nadir body temperature: 33.0℃) despite active warming with an air warmer. Subsequently, continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.1 µg/kg/min) until the end of the operation was required to maintain her MAP within an acceptable range. At the end of surgery, her body temperature increased to 35.7℃, but metabolic acidosis was sustained despite frequent administration of NaHCO3 (arterial pH: 7.23; base excess: -10.0 mEq/L). During the surgery, the patient was infused with a total of 2,900 ml of fluid, including 1,500 ml of balanced crystalloid solution, 100 ml of half-normal saline, 300 ml of 5% dextrose water, and 1,000 ml of 5% albumin, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells. After 9 hours of surgery, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit. Hemodynamic and laboratory changes during the operation are shown in .\nAfter surgery, the AST and ALT concentrations of the patient increased rapidly (immediate postoperative AST 2,108 IU/L and ALT 2,351 IU/L), reaching 7,300 IU/L and 6,400 IU/L, respectively, on the second day after the operation. She required continuous infusion of fresh frozen plasma due to prolongation of prothrombin time (3.07-5.69 INR). Her total bilirubin concentration, which was 0.5 mg/dl preoperatively, increased to 3.4 mg/dl postoperatively. The patient was diagnosed with primary hepatic graft failure and scheduled for re-transplantation of the liver. An adult to child living donor liver transplantation was performed on the third day after multivisceral transplantation. During this operation, the patient's vital signs remained stable until reperfusion, including a MAP of 70-80 mmHg. Ten minutes before reperfusion, her arterial blood pH was 7.49 with a base excess of -0.1 mEq/L, arterial lactate concentration was 3.8 mmol/L, Na+ was 137 mmol/L, K+ was 3.3 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.97 mmol/L, hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl, and blood glucose was 170 mg/dl. After reperfusion, PRS developed again and lasted over 1 min. She received three injections each of 4 µg epinephrine and 20 µg of phenylephrine to maintain MAP within an acceptable level. Her arterial lactate concentration was 3.1 mmol/L at pH 7.44 with a base excess of -2.2 mEq/L, Na+ concentration was 138 mmol/L, K+ was 2.9 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 1.00 mmol/L, and hemoglobin was 6.8 g/dl. After transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells, her vital signs remained stable (MAP: 70-76 mmHg) until the end of the operation. At that time, plasma hemoglobin concentration was 11.9 g/dl, AST was 453 IU/L, ALT was 695 IU/L, total bilirubin was 3.6 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.6 mg/dl, albumin was 2.9 g/dl, and prothrombin time was 1.74 INR. Her serum AST and ALT concentrations decreased gradually. On the seventh day after liver transplantation, AST and ALT concentrations had declined to 69 IU/L and 150 IU/L, respectively, her total bilirubin was 1.4 mg/dl, prothrombin time was 1.07 INR, and feeding through gastrostomy tube was started. The patient was managed conservatively for 3 months including 50 day stay in the Intensive Care Unit and discharged in an improved condition 139 days after multivisceral transplantation. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

She was reported to have acquired head control by the 3rd month of life but was noted to be retarded in her neuromotor development at age 6 months and was able to walk at age 2.5 years. Hearing impairment was identified when she was 7 years old. Based on her Denver Development Test results which indicated defective neuromotor development, it was recommended that she receive special education. At age 11 years, she had been diagnosed to have aortic stenosis and was being followed by the cardiology department. Her two siblings and her non-consanguineous parents were healthy. The patient’s weight was 41 kg [-0.8 standard deviation score (SDS)], height 133.5 cm (-3.5 SDS) and head circumference was 50 cm.\nBone age was 11 years. Midparental height (MPH) was 151.8 cm (3-10p). At physical examination, abdominal obesity and scoliosis of the lumbar vertebrae were noted. Inspection also revealed a thin upper lip, prognathism and ear auricle anomaly. The 4th and 5th metacarpals of both hands were short and overriding of the toes was present. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable. Pubertal status was compatible with stage 3. A systolic murmur was heard in all heart focuses. Bilateral hearing loss and right nystagmus were also present. Laboratory examination results showed that serum lipid values were in the upper normal range (total cholesterol: 176 mg/dL, triglyceride: 187 mg/dL) and that her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was high (8.16 IU/mL). Her anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) level was 83.9 IU/mL and her anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) level was 92.6 IU/mL. Thyroid imaging revealed a thyroid volume of 7.3 mL. The patient was diagnosed to have Hashimoto thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism and was started on L-thyroxine (L-T4). Immunoglobulin A (IgA) values were measured and found to be normal. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels were low (<-2 SD) for age.\nAt follow-up, annual height growth rate was 6.5 cm/year. Weight gain was also found to be accelerated. At 13 years and 8 months, acanthosis nigricans appeared on the neck and armpits and striae in the lumbar regions. In a review of her history, no laboratory data suggesting iatrogenic Cushing’s disease were found, but the patient had received local steroid treatment for atopic eczema for approximately 3 years.\nMetformin therapy was started following determination of a peak insulin level of 400 IU/mL. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was measured at 5.7. The patient lost weight and IR regressed with treatment (HOMA-IR: 2.43).\nChromosomal structure in our patient was deletion of 18 (q21.31-q23).

His baseline serum creatinine (sCr) level was 79.6 μmol/L and his urinary protein level was 0.3 g/gCr. His blood pressure was well controlled with an aldosterone receptor blocker. DM control was poor (haemoglobin A1c 9.0–10.0%) under intensive conventional insulin therapy. His diabetic retinopathy was simple type. Pregabalin, duloxetine and mexiletine were also used for diabetic neuropathy. His family history was not significant except cerebral infarction in his grandmother. He initially visited a primary care unit because of general fatigue and high fever and was given oral levofloxacin. However, he later called an urgent care unit because of swelling and pain in his genitals. He was diagnosed with Fournier gangrene and admitted to our hospital (Fig. , clinical course). Table showed urinary, blood and culture examination on admission. Inflammatory markers were elevated (white blood cell count 25,700/μL with left shift and C reactive protein 28.8 mg/L). Renal function was slightly abnormal (Blood urine nitrogen 22.0 mg/dL, sCr 91.1 μmol/L) and proteinuria was detected. Blood culture was negative. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were detected from wound culture. Free air was noted in his genital area via computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. ). He underwent debridement and received tazobactam/piperacillin (PIPC/TAZ) 4.5 g every 8 h and intravenous VCM 1.5 g every 12 h. Because his trough VCM level was still low (9.24 μg/mL, 15–20 μg/mL is for complicated infections []) and sCr stable (83.1 μmol/L) on day 3, intravenous VCM increased to 1.5 g every 8 h. Thereafter, he developed pitting pedal edema, weight gain (10 kg), reduced urine volume (100 mL/day), increased sCr (416.4 μmol/L) and trough VCM level (80.48 μg/mL) on day 6, which suggested VCM-induced AKI. Urinary examination results, which included N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase of 32.0 U/L, α1-microgloblin of 25.7 mg/L, and β2-microgloblin of 1800 μg/L, were also consistent with AKI. CT scan showed no signs of hydronephrosis or renal atrophy (Fig. ). Gallium scintigraphy showed significant accumulation in both kidneys (Fig. ).\nVCM and PIPC/TAZ were switched to ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT), and frequent haemodialysis was performed on days 6–17, a total of seven times over 12 days (seven 4-h sessions with a blood flow rate of 120–150 mL/min and dialysate flow rate of 500 mL/min). Ethylene vinyl alcohol membrane was used on days 6 and 7, whereas polysulfone membrane was used on days 9, 11, 12, 14, and 17. His urine volume began to increase as his plasma VCM levels gradually decreased. A renal biopsy was performed on day 18 to rule out other renal disorders and evaluate for diabetic nephropathy. ABPC/SBT was switched to ciprofloxacin on day 13 because of a rash that developed mainly on his abdomen and back, and clindamycin was added on days 16–22. He was discharged on day 49 without haemodialysis and antibiotics (sCr, 145.0 μmol/L). Eight months later, his sCr was decreased to 109.6 μmol/L.\nThe specimen included 16 glomeruli with cortex (no medulla). Subcapsular and medullary ray fibrosis was found in 10% of the specimen on Masson staining (Fig. ). Glomeruli showed no sclerotic or inflammatory changes, but mild mesangial expansion without significant depositions of immunoglobulin or complement in immunofluorescence was found. Nodular lesions were not detected (Fig. ). Focal but severe AIN (Fig. ) and tubular epithelium injury with nuclear denudation or tubular dilatation (ATN) (Fig. ) were detected. Interstitial monocyte infiltration and tubulitis were mainly distributed in the medullary ray lesions (Fig. ). There were no obvious eosinophilic infiltrations or granular lesions in the specimen. Mild intimal fibrosis was found in some of the small interlobular arteries, and mild hyalinosis was also noted in an arteriole. In summary, the kidney biopsy showed that ATN and focal AIN with mild diabetic nephropathy. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 65-year-old male with end-stage heart failure presented with worsening shortness of breath for the past month. He had a history of atrial fibrillation and ischemic cardiomyopathy and was currently on milrinone infusion and post-CRT-D placement. At the time of admission, his vital signs were within normal limits. The physical exam was most notable for an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) up to the angle of the jaw and decreased breath sounds on the left side of the chest. A chest x-ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion as shown in Figure . Initial escalation of diuretic therapy led to acute kidney injury. During right heart catheterization (RHC), the operator reported apparent right internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombosis based on an ultrasound exam. After cannulation of the left IJV and upon contrast injection, complete occlusion of the left subclavian vein was noted. RHC via femoral access revealed normal right heart filling pressure (right atrial pressure 6 mmHg), normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (10 mmHg), and decreased cardiac index (1.94 L/min/m2). Next, ultrasound evaluation of the right subclavian vein showed partial thrombosis. The patient was already on therapeutic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, so this treatment was continued to treat the subclavian deep vein thrombosis.\nThe left-sided pleural effusion noted at admission was evaluated via diagnostic thoracentesis; this yielded 2 L of cloudy fluid, so a pigtail catheter for continuous drainage was placed. The pleural fluid studies were normal with the exception of triglycerides (1177 mg/dL), which was consistent with chylothorax. Because of continued high output (1-2 L/day) from the chest tube, the patient was started on a low-fat diet.\nNext, a venogram was used to assess for venous obstruction as a possible cause of the chylothorax. The venogram revealed occlusion of bilateral brachiocephalic veins as shown in Figures -. The occluded right brachiocephalic vein was successfully recanalized after angioplasty using a 12 mm balloon as shown in Figure . However, CRT-D wires prevented intervention on the left brachiocephalic vein. After this intervention, chest tube output decreased to a negligible amount, so the tube was removed.\nFor the next five days, the patient was monitored with serial chest x-rays, but there was no reaccumulation of pleural effusion as shown in Figure . Therefore, we decided not to intervene upon the left brachiocephalic vein thrombosis. The patient was eventually discharged home on apixaban. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 65 years old. Because the age is between 65 and 74, one point added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Because stroke history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5.

He was diagnosed with obstructive uropathy in 2013 and subsequently developed end-stage renal disease with a baseline creatinine of three. He was managed successfully with medication till March 2020 when his renal functions deteriorated and he was offered a renal transplant.\nAs part of the pre-transplant workup, a CT scan of the abdomen, chest, and pelvis suggested multiple enlarged necrotic lymph nodes in the peripancreatic and portocaval areas. The largest node was found abutting the head of the pancreas measuring 23 mm x 18 mm (Figure ). The patient’s hemoglobin, white blood count, and C-reactive protein levels were 8.9 g/dL, 12,000/mm3, and 7.63 mg/L. The liver function tests were within the normal range. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow up.\nThe patient was re-admitted via the emergency department (ED) in December 2020 with fever, decreased urine output, and right sub-costal pain. Initial investigations revealed hemoglobin, white blood count, and C-reactive protein levels of 6.7 g/dL, 16,000/mm3, and 65.88 mg/L respectively. Liver function tests were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen suggested an interval increase in the size of the peripancreatic and portocaval lymph nodes. The patient's chest X-ray was performed, which was unremarkable.\nHe was subsequently referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy of the peripancreatic lymph node mass. EUS was performed with a curvilinear scope. A necrotic lymph node mass was identified near the uncinate/head of the pancreas (Figure ). Multiple biopsies were taken with a 22G FNB Acquire needle. Histopathology suggested the presence of predominantly necrotic and scanty fibro collagenous tissue containing occasional granulomas. The granulomas were composed of epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells (Figure ). Mycobacterium tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (MTB-PCR) was positive confirming the diagnosis of TB.\nThe patient was commenced on anti-tuberculosis treatment. A repeat CT abdomen in March 2021 suggested interval reduction in the sizes of the centrally necrotic lymph nodes in peripancreatic and portocaval locations compared to the CT abdomen performed in December 2020, from 47 mm x 26 mm to 35 mm x 30 mm and 26 mm x 35 mm to 18 mm x 23 mm respectively (Figure ). Clinically the patient had improved significantly with no further episodes of pyrexia or abdominal pain. The blood tests improved as well, with hemoglobin, white blood count, and C-reactive protein levels of 13.9 g/dL, 8500/mm3, and 2.02 mg/L respectively.

On arrival to accident and emergency department, he was conscious, alert, and oriented. His pulse was 121 beats per minute, blood pressure was 96/53 (mean 68) mmHg, and respiratory rate was 30 cycles per minute. His abdomen was distended with an epigastric bruise. On admission his hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL (12 to 14.5), white blood cell count was 20.3×109/L (3.6 to 9.6), serum amylase was 116 U/L (30 to 118), and glucose was 26.8 mmol/L (3.6 to 8.9; Table ). Pan-CT revealed a grade III liver injury (Fig. ), grade I bilateral renal injury, and a suspicion of splenic injury was raised by the radiology registrar. The CT films were reviewed next day by a consultant radiologist and reported a grade III to IV pancreatic injury (Fig. ). Our patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and was treated conservatively. Because he was stable, he was discharged to the surgical ward by day 3. His blood test results were monitored closely and showed a gradual rise in serum amylase level during the first week of injury (Fig. ). At day 18 he developed abdominal distension and vomiting. An abdominal examination revealed a palpable epigastric mass. A CT scan showed a pseudocyst (Fig. ) which was aspirated percutaneously under ultrasound guidance by an interventional radiologist. The cyst recurred at day 25 (Fig. ) so a pigtail catheter was inserted for continuous drainage under ultrasound guidance. Throughout his stay, he was maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The pigtail catheter was removed after ten days and a low fat diet was started by day 44 as he did not tolerate orally administered nutrition earlier. He was discharged home at day 55 in good health.

    "problem": "<Context> A seven-year-old, intact male, mixed breed dog weighing 8.1 kg was presented to the Emergency Service of the Department of Clinical Science of Companion Animals of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University with a 2 weeks history of lethargy, progressive dyspnea and coughing. The dog previously lived in the Cape Verdean islands for approximately 3 years and returned to the Netherlands 10 months before presentation. In the past 2 years, the dog had showed chronic mild exercise intolerance and had a few episodes of diarrhea that resolved with symptomatic therapy. The dog was up-to date with his vaccinations and anthelminthic treatments.\nPhysical examination showed generalized weakness and decrease mental state. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia, weak peripheral pulses, pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, jugular distensions and venous pulses, and a grade three out of six systolic murmur with the point of maximal intensity over the right cardiac apex. The dog was also severely dyspneic and demonstrated harsh lung sounds on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and positive undulation was detected. These findings were consistent with pulmonary disease, right-sided heart failure and poor peripheral perfusion.\nComplete blood count (CBC) showed a moderate microcytic, hypochromic anemia, moderate leukocytosis with a marked left shift and a severe thrombocytopenia. Biochemistry showed severe hyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia and a mild hypoalbuminemia. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a polyclonal peak in the gamma globulin region. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a severe hypoxemia with hypocapnia. Urinalysis showed mild hemoglobinuria, glucosuria and proteinuria. Blood samples were submitted for serological and molecular biological testing. Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) for E. canis (MegaFLUO Ehrlichia canis®, Mega Cor Diagnostik GmbH, Hörbranz, Austria) was positive (IgG titer >2560), but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for Ehrlichia genus (real-time PCR, Light Cycler® 2.0, Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Mannheim, Germany, primers used as described previously []) was negative. Serology for Leishmania sp. (Dog-DAT®, Leishmania specific antibody detection kit, Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and B.\ncanis. (MegaFLUO Babesis canis®, Mega Cor Diagnostik GmbH, Hörbranz, Austria) and antigen snap tests for A. vasorum (Angio Detect™ Test, IDEXX Laboratories) and Dirofilaria immitis (SNAP® Heartworm RT Test, IDEXX Laboratories) were also negative. Laboratory results are summarized in Table .\nOn thoracic radiographs, a mild diffuse increase in pulmonary opacity with an interstitial lung pattern and mild peribronchial cuffing was seen, which was most accentuated in the caudodorsal lung lobes. Thin pleural fissure lines were noted between all lung lobes. The cardiac silhouette showed signs of right-sided cardiomegaly (vertebral heart score (VHS): 11.0, reference interval <9.7 ± 0.5) and a main pulmonary artery knuckle was present on the dorsoventral view (Fig. ).\nEchocardiography showed dilation of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, septal flattening and a severe tricuspid regurgitation. The left ventricle was severely under filled (Fig. ). Congenital defects and left heart disease were excluded. The maximal tricuspid systolic velocity was 5.83 m/s, indicating a peak tricuspid gradient of approximately 136 mm Hg which is graded as severe PH (reference <40 mm Hg, severe >75 mm Hg) [], (Fig. ).\nTo address the severe hypoxemia and PH the dog was placed in an oxygen cage with an inspired concentration of oxygen between 40 and 50 %. The clinical signs of the dog did not improve markedly with the extra oxygen supplementation. Because anemia could have contributed to the cardiovascular signs and the poor tissue oxygenation, a typed packed red blood cell transfusion was administered. Based on the travel history, the abnormalities within the CBC and biochemical analysis and the positive serology for E. canis, an infection with CME was suspected. Treatment with doxycycline (5 mg/kg, orally twice daily) (Doxoral®, AST Farma, Oudewater, the Netherlands), pimobendan (0.3 mg/kg, orally twice daily) (Cardisure® Flavour, Eurovet Animal Health BV, Bladel, the Netherlands) and sildenafil (1.5 mg/kg, orally twice daily) (Viagra®, Pfizer, New York, USA) was initiated.\nThe hematocrit increased from 20 to 36 % after the blood transfusion and the dog’s clinical condition improved remarkably. However, the dog remained moderately dyspneic and severely hypoxic (PaO2: 46.5 mm Hg, reference interval: 85.0–103.3 mm Hg). The dyspnea gradually improved and the dog seemed comfortable outside the oxygen cage after 6 days of treatment, although the improvement of the hypoxemia was only minimal (PaO2: 55 mm Hg, reference interval: 85–103.3 mm Hg, Table ). Because of financial limitations of the owner, the dog was discharged with the above-mentioned therapies at that time.\nSeventeen days after initiation of treatment, the dog was admitted via the cardiology polyclinics of the same university and re-examined. At that time, there was complete resolution of all clinical signs and physical examination was completely unremarkable. CBC showed normal platelet counts and leukogram, with only a very mild microcytic hypochromic anemia. Biochemical analysis again showed severe hyperproteinemia and hyperglobulinemia. The albumin concentration normalized. The IgG titer for E. canis (IFAT) was again very high (IgG titer 2560) (Table ). Thoracic radiography showed marked improvement with resolution of cardiomegaly (VHS: 10.2, reference interval 9.7 ± 0.5) and only a very mild interstitial pattern of the caudodorsal lung lobes and a very mild dilation of the pulmonary artery (Fig. ) as remaining abnormalities. Echocardiography also showed a remarkable improvement. Tricuspid regurgitation was no longer present and only a very mild uniform dilation of the pulmonary artery was still present (Fig. ). Therapy with pimobendan and sildenafil were discontinued and the treatment with doxycycline was continued for another 5 weeks.\nThe dog was reevaluated 4 weeks later and was clinically doing very well. Nevertheless, the dog again developed mild anemia and the hyperproteinemia persisted. Proteinuria had resolved at that time (Table ). Doxycycline therapy was continued for another 4 weeks and another re-examination was advised.

A third pregnancy hesitated in a spontaneous abortion. Her father is 169 cm whereas her mother is 150 cm high.\nShe was born at 39 gestational weeks, after normal pregnancy, by Caesarian section. Intrauterine growth retardation was detected during last weeks of gestation and her neonatal weight was 2.400 Kg, with a stature of 48 cm and an occipito-frontal circumference of 33 cm. In neonatal period, because of heart murmur, she underwent echocardiographic evaluation that evidenced an ostium secundum interatrial defect, spontaneously closed at 2 years. At 7 years slight hairs covered her back and arms, and overweigh was noted. Her parents reported slowdown in growth curve in the last 6 months despite a rapid increase in body weight.\nAnthropometric values and clinical findings at 7 years were: stature 114.6 cm (3-10th centile), weight 25 kg (75th centile), BMI 19 (90-95th centile). Pubertal development was PH1 B1 following Tanner stage; genetic target was cm 153.5 + 6. At a further observation at 8 years, she presented with healthy condition, short stature (height cm 116 – below 3rd centile), overweight (weight kg 29 – 75th centile, BMI 21.55 – above 95th centile), hypertrichosis with slightly hairy legs and back, mild short neck, very mild valgus elbow, and small joint hyperlaxity, shortening of the fifth metacarpal with syndactyly of 2th and 3th of the toes.\nAt a first examination, laboratory tests evidenced: FSH: 12.3 mIU/ml; LH: 0.8 mIU/ml; Estradiol 10.2 pg/ml. Adrenal and thyroid profiles were within the normal range for age. Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal kidney, and pelvic echography showed reduced ovarian size range for age (right ovary 15 mm × 8 mm × 12 mm; left 13 mm × 7.4 mm × 10 mm). Because of hairiness increase, a new serum hormonal evaluation was performed at 7.5 years: laboratory tests showed elevated FSH values (31.3 mUI/ml) with normal prepuberal values of LH (0,7 mUI/ml) and Estradiol (13.2 pg/ml); a further pelvic ultrasound revealed infantile uterus and confirmed size reduced ovaries.\nAnalysis of FMR1 triplet repeat sizes in the proband by repeat primed PCR [] revealed sizes in the normal range (20 to 33 CGG repeats) (data not shown).\nDuring 1-year follow-up period, a POI was suspected according to high FSH and LH levels and low Estradiol, inhibin B and AMH levels. Serum FSH and LH values increased to 179.90 mlU/ml and 40.30 mlU/ml respectively, while Estradiol decreased to 10 pg/ml. Inhibin B showed a level <20 pg/ml and AMH serum levels were 0.4 ng/ml, well below the normal range.\nBone age of 6 years was assessed by radiological examination of the left-hand wrist (Tanner e Whitehouse (TW2) method), despite a chronological age of 8 years. Stimulation tests for growth hormone (GH) reserve were performed because of deceleration of growth curve, increased gap from the stature target, and retardation of bone age. Testing for GH revealed a 1.4 ng/ml peak after arginine injection (0.5 g Arginina/kg in vein infusion in 30 minutes) and a 4.5 ng/ml peak after clonidine administration (100 mcg/m2 per os).

A repeated transthoracic echocardiography showed a LVEF of 45% in .\nPlasma cortisol, renin, aldosterone and a 24-hour urine sample for steroid metabolites were within normal range. 3-Metthoxyadrenalin was elevated to 2,5 nmol/L (normal range: < 0,46 nmol/L) as well as 3-Metthoxynoradrenalin at 29,6 nmol/L (normal range < 1,09 nmol/L).\nDuring this observation, the patient reported no symptoms and was discharged for planned surgery in an outpatient setting.\nDue to the size of the tumor (6 cm in diameter) and hence a slightly increased risk of malignancy, open left-sided adrenalectomy was performed [].\nThe patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after uncomplicated surgery and observation period. Follow-up showed normalization of 3-metthoxyadrenalin and 3-metthoxynoradrenalin, and the patient had not experienced any symptoms or complications.\nThe left adrenal gland was found with a well-defined pheochromocytoma with a maximum diameter of 25 mm. The tumor morphology was with the growth of large nests and solid areas, high cellularity and areas with spindle cells as well as areas with profound nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. Thus, the Pheochromocytoma of Adrenal Gland Scales (PASS) score was 8 in []. It is not possible to predict the malign potential of a pheochromocytoma from the histopathology, but a PASS score > 4 indicates potential for aggressive clinical behavior. Thus, the patient will be followed with annually blood tests (3-metthoxyadrenalin, 3-metthoxynoradrenalin) lifelong. []. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's HEART score? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 29-year-old woman (height, 164 cm; weight, 85 kg; gravid 2; parity 0) underwent cesarean delivery at 23 weeks' gestation. She had a history of antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosed by her rheumatologist 11 years ago. She experienced deep vein thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies and was lupus anticoagulant positive in that time. She was taking Astrix (100 mg/day). Six days before operation, she was admitted due to persistant epigastric pain. Blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 72 beats/min and body temperature was 36.8℃. Blood laboratory data were as follows: serum aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) 549 IU/L, serum alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) 489 IU/L, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 790 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 17.5 mg/dl, creatinine 0.5 mg/dl, hematocrit 29.7%, platelet count 54 × 103/ml, prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 82.4 sec. A urine specimen demonstrated proteinuria (1+). Transabdominal ultrasound showed weak portal vein flow (main, 18.4 cm/sec; right, 30 cm/sec; left, 29 cm/sec) with a small amount of ascites. The obstetrician suggested autoimmune hepatitis or portal vein thrombosis was complicating antiphospholipid syndrome rather than HELLP syndrome because of the early gestational period and normal blood pressure. Repeated daily blood chemistries revealed an aPTT of 41-60 sec and therefore 1,000 unit/hour of heparin was initiated to reach the target aPTT of 80-100 seconds and 40 mg of prednisolone was added as treatment. For evaluating autoimmune hepatitis, auto-antibodies were checked. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IgG (51.8 GPL units/ml) was positive and IgM (2.76 MPL units/ml) was negative. A lupus anticoagulant test was also positive (control ratio of 2.67). Other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. On the morning of the operation, she had abrupt vomiting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures with eyeball deviations of 30-40 sec; she recovered spontaneously. One hour after the 1st seizure attack, she had another seizure attack with high blood pressure (200/100 mmHg); hydralazine and diazepam was given. The laboratory findings revealed AST/ALT 1,459/1,108 IU/L, LDH 1,424 IU/L, hematocrit 30%, platelet count 43 × 103/ml, aPTT 87.6 sec and urine protein (4+).\nAn emergency cesarean delivery was scheduled, she was not premedicated and upon arrival to the operating room, standard monitoring devices were applied. Vital signs were blood pressure 190/120 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats/min and pulse oxymetry revealed 99% oxygen saturation before anesthetic induction. The patient already received heparin and therefore, the patient did not wear a compression stocking as this could increase arterial blood pressure with increased venous return. Anesthesia was induced with 300 mg of pentothal sodium and 50 mg of rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was performed using a single lumen internal diameter (ID) 6.5 mm tube in one attempt without difficulty. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (1-2%) within BIS between 30-60. Systolic blood pressure was maintained about 140-160 mmHg using intravenous nicardipine (100-300 ug bolus) and body temperature was maintained about 36.8-37.3℃. A cesarean delivery was performed by a Pfannenstiel incision and a 470 gram live-born male infant was delivered (APGAR score; at 1 min, 3 and at 5 min, 7). Intravenous magnesium sulfate (170 mg/hour) and alfentanyl (1,000 ug) were given to the patient. The cesarean delivery proceeded without an event. The patient received fentanyl (1,000 ug) in 100 ml of normal saline for 48 h using patient controlled intravenous analgesia. At the end of surgery, all anesthetic agents were discontinued and the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with pyridostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Estimated blood loss was 500 ml and she was not transfused with blood components. The tracheal tube was removed when the patient responded to verbal commands and showed sufficient spontaneous respiration and neuromuscular function. There were no signs of uterine atony or bleeding. Pathologic observation of the placenta revealed mulifocal infarction involving up to 40% of the placenta. The patient remained in the post-anesthetic care unit for 1 hour event free and was then transferred to the intensive care unit. Intravenous magnesium sulfate used for 24 hours and she was transferred to the general ward at postoperative day 1. She had an uneventful recovery with improved liver function and platelet counts () and was discharged on postoperative day 8. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

The patient presented with chief complaints of snoring, difficulty in breathing during sleeping, and irritation of the throat for 5 months. In addition, she also complained of dyspnea on exertion with mild-to-moderate activity. The patient was a tobacco chewer for 40 years and had undergone tubal ligation in the past which was uneventful.\nAirway examination revealed a mouth opening of three fingers, a Mallampati grade of 3 with bilateral tonsillar enlargement, and a normal thyromental distance. There was no restriction in movement at the joints in the neck/spine. The cervical spine X-ray in the lateral view revealed enlarged adenoids.\nInside the operation theater after attaching the monitors for plethysmograph, capnograph, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure, the patient was preoxygenated. The patient was then premedicated with injections glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg), midazolam (1 mg), and fentanyl (2 μg/kg) intravenously, followed by induction with propofol (2 mg/kg) intravenously. After checking for adequate ventilation, the patient was given muscle relaxant intravenous succinylcholine (100 mg).

    "problem": "<Context> A 66-year-old woman was admitted with the symptoms of acute dyspnoe, orthopnoe and progressive dysphagia. The inspection of the oral cavity revealed an extensive lesion of the tongue (Fig. ) with areas of exophytic growth of the tumor as well as a large ulcus located at the dorsal part of the tongue. This large tumor of the tongue occupied nearly the whole oral cavity and the anterior part of the tongue's margin clearly showed biting traces. These inspectatory findings were accompanied by a respective halitosis. Both the general and nutritional status of the patient were clearly reduced with a body mass index (BMI) of 15.6 kg/m2 (body weight of 40 kg and height of 1.60 m). The medical examination revealed the presence of bilateral large cervical conglomerates of lymph nodes that sonographically measured 6 cm in diameter. An acute obstruction of the upper airway by the tumor mass could be excluded by native computed tomography (CT) imaging of the neck and therefore a tracheotomy was not performed. At admission, the diameter of the tumor was already greater than 10 cm (Fig. ). At the same time, a bioptic tissue probe was analyzed histologically and revealed a low grade differenciated (G3) SCC (Fig. ). Imaging by fluorine 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET; Fig. , ) scans showed cervical hypermetabolic foci along the nerve-vessel-sheaths of both sides that were suspect for malignancy and assessed as metastases with regard to sensitivity and specifity of PET and CT scan. Multiple metastatic lesions were also present in the lung. Furthermore, foci that were suspect for metastases were also found unilaterally in the muscular system of both the left part of the back and left anterior thoracic wall. On the basis of these rather atypical findings, we performed a total body CT in order to exclude the simultaneous presence of a second malignoma.\nAltogether, one suspect soft tissue metastasis could be identified near the left upper ventral thoracal wall (Fig. ). A further and smaller soft tissue metastasis was found caudal of the sterno-costal base of the first rib in close vicinity to the internal mammary artery. Another metastasis emerged within the thoracic cavity in the right paraaortal soft tissue sheath. A metastasis measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter was detected in the right iliocostal lumborum muscle near the pelvic rim (Fig. ). In the right vastus medialis/intermedius muscle one soft tissue metastasis of a diameter of several centimeters was found (Fig. ). Also, more caudal, a metastasis of approx. 1 cm in diameter was shown in the right adductor magnus muscle. In the long head of the left biceps femoris muscle another metastasis measuring a few millimeters was identified.\nIn summary, the tumor staging according to the UICC (Union internationale contre le cancer) revealed a terminal cT4cN3cM1(G3)(C3) tumor. At this advanced stage, surgical therapy with curative intention was not indicated. At the same time, the patient strictly refused a surgical reduction of the tumor, a palliative radiochemotherapy as well as the application of a PEG-device. Therefore, she was transferred to the palliative care unit. The patient finally deceased after 5 weeks of hospitalization by a cardiopulmonary failure as a consequence of the tumor progression. The histologic confirmation of the suspect radiologic diagnoses, which included the spreading of the neoplasia, could be made only for the intraoral findings within the limits of the primary diagnostics, because the patient's relatives did not consent to perform an autopsy despite our request. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

Preoperative evaluation revealed no remarkable risk factors such as hypertension or glucose intolerance. Thus, the patient was considered to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I during the preoperative consultation, and a combined spinalepidural anesthesia technique was planned. The patient was not premedicated. Monitoring involved electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Body temperature was monitored by a thermistor equipped at the top of a urinary catheter.\nWith the patient fully awake, the epidural catheter was placed at the T12/L1 space, and a spinal tap was performed at the L2/L3 space with a 25-G Quincke needle in the left lateral decubitus position after skin sterilization with 0.5 w/v% chlorhexidine gluconate/ethanol. After backflow of clear cerebrospinal fluid, 12.5 mg of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine without preservatives (AstraZeneca, Osaka, Japan) with 15 µg of fentanyl (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) were injected into the subarachnoid space. The patient was then placed in the supine position. Discernible sensory block to cold sensation was promptly observed. Finally, before the start of the surgical incision, a sensory block to cold to the T3 level with accompanying motor block was obtained. Vasopressors, including 8.0 mg of ephedrine and 0.6 mg of phenylephrine, were administrated to maintain systolic blood pressure at >100 mmHg during the operation. In total, 900 ml of a crystalloid and 500 ml of a colloid were administrated intravenously.\nThe surgical procedure proceeded uneventfully, and a live male infant and placenta were delivered 9 and 11 min after skin incision, respectively. All other surgical findings were unremarkable, and routine antibiotics and uterotonic oxytocin were administered. No drugs were administered into the epidural space. Because no hypnotics were used for sedation, the patient was awake during the operation.\nThe operation was completed 1 h 10 min after the spinal tap.

The patient's temperature is 39.3 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 38 degrees Celsius, and so we add one point to the score, making the current score 1 + 1 = 2. The patient note reports 'cough absent' as absent for the patient. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 2. The patient note reports 'tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes' as absent for the patient. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 2. The patient note reports 'exudate or swelling on tonsils' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3. Hence, the Centor score for the patient is 3.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 26-year-old female patient weighing 35 kg, presented with strangulated umbilical hernia. Her previous medical records revealed she was a known case of DCMP and chronic kidney disease since 2 years. She was presently on treatment with tablet digoxin 0.25 mg, tablet furosemide 40 mg, and tablet carvedilol 12.5 mg once a day. She gave a history of repeated hospital admissions in the past 2 years with features suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) and was on regular twice weekly maintenance hemodialysis, last being 2 days before the surgery.\nOn preanesthetic evaluation, her heart rate was 96 beats/min, regular; blood pressure was 106/72 mmHg; respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min. On auscultation grade, three ejection systolic murmurs were audible. There were no rhonchi or crepitations. Air entry was equal bilaterally. There was no hepatomegaly, ascitis, or pedal edema. The skin overlying the hernia appeared necrosed.\nThe preoperative 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography demonstrated global hypokinesia, poor systolic function with LVEF of 28%, all 4 chambers dilated, severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly with normal lung fields. Her investigations showed Hb 7.9 g/dl, total leukocyte count TLC 12.9 × 1000/μl, platelet count 219 × 1000/mm3, urea 28.9 mg/dl, creatinine 3.6 mg/dl, sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, international normalized ratio of 1.05.\nA high-risk written and informed consent was obtained in view of cardiac and renal disease. After shifting to the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula was secured. Under strict aseptic precautions, an 18-gauge epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space at T10-11 interspace using loss of resistance to air technique. A 22-gauge right radial arterial cannula was secured since the left hand had an arteriovenous fistula. Under local anesthesia, a 7 Fr, 15 cm triple lumen central venous catheter was inserted into a right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance for intensive hemodynamic monitoring.\nThe following parameters were monitored: Two lead ECG (II and V5), invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide, body temperature, and urine output. FloTrac® continuous cardiac monitoring was done to monitor cardiac output, cardiac index and stroke volume variability (SVV).\nAnesthesia was induced with injection etomidate 0.2 mg/kg, injection fentany l 3 μg/kg. Injection cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg IV was given to facilitate intubation with size 7.0 mm endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% air in oxygen, desflurane 4%–6%, and intermittent boluses of 1 mg cisatracurium. An epidural infusion of 0.05% ropivacaine with 2 μg/ml fentanyl was started at 5 ml/h. The CVP was maintained between 8 and 10 cmH2O, cardiac output of 6.8 L/min, cardiac index of 5.5 L/min/m2, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 835 dyne/s/cm5. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.381, pO2193 mmHg, pCO232.1 mmHg, base excess - 5.8 mmol/L, HCO3− 18.6 mmol/L.\nWe started injection noradrenaline infusion at 0.08 μg/kg/min and injection dobutamine infusion at 5 μg/kg/min which were tapered slowly towards the end of surgery. Surgeons found only ascitic fluid as the sac contents which was then aspirated. There was no bowel or omentum. The neck of the hernia was found to be very narrow, and defect was closed without a mesh. The procedure lasted for 90 min. Blood loss was about 100 ml. Intraoperatively, a total of 400 ml of normal saline was given. Paracetamol 500 mg IV was given as a means to achieve multimodal analgesia. At the end of surgery, after the return of respiratory efforts, the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and extubated. The patient had stable hemodynamics throughout the procedure []. The patient was shifted to surgical recovery room, and all the intraoperative monitoring was continued postoperatively. A continuous epidural infusion of 0.05% ropivacaine with 1 μg/ml fentanyl was continued postoperatively.\nAll her preoperative medications were continued as per the recommended scheduled dosing and timing. The patient was shifted from the recovery room after 4 h.

After admission, she became nauseated and vomited; but without dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency. She had a medical history of type I diabetes for 19 months, with poor control of blood glucose due to non-compliance with the insulin treatments. One month prior, she was found to have kidney stones. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 36.0 °C, pulse rate of 87 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min, and a blood pressure of 105/66 mm of Hg. She had shortness of breath, dry skin, and dry mucous membranes and tongue; although her lungs sounded clear. There was an abdominal wall muscle strain in the epigastric area and right upper quadrant, with obvious tenderness. The right costovertebral angle also had tenderness.\nLaboratory tests and imaging studies were as follows. Blood tests after admission showed a white blood cell count of 21.08 × 109/L, neutrophil count of 18.53 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage of 87.9%, platelet count of 107 × 109/L; and concentrations for albumin of 37.42 g/L, glucose of 35.95 mmol/L, urea of 10.54 mmol/L, creatinine of 145.1 μmol/L, bicarbonate of 2.2 mmol/L, potassium of 6.60 mmol/L, sodium of 122.10 mmol/L, β-hydroxybutyric acid of 10.08 mmol/L, lactic acid of 2.43 mmol/L, C-reactive protein of 448.39 mg/L, and procalcitonin > 100.000 ng/mL. Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 6.984, carbon dioxide partial pressure of 10.9 mm of Hg, oxygen partial pressure of 138.2 mm of Hg, measured bicarbonate of 2.5 mmol/L, calculated bicarbonate of 6.4 mmol/L, anion gap of 32.2 mmol/L, base excess of − 27.2 mmol/L, and carbon dioxide of 2.9 mmol/L. Urinalysis measurements were glucose, 4+; ketone body, 4+; leukocyte esterase, weakly positive; and white blood cell number, 41/μL; with negative results for urine culture. Blood culture identified Escherichia coli. Urinary CT scan revealed multiple stones in the right kidney and lower ureter, with right hydronephrosis; we therefore diagnosed EPN (Figs. , , and reflect the CT scans during hospital admission).\nAfter being admitted to the hospital for definite diagnosis, our endocrinology department cooperated with urology, nephrology, infection department and imaging department to formulate a treatment plan, which suggested that the patients should undergo percutaneous drainage but the patient refused. Hospital management and outcomes after admission included intravenous infusion of small doses of insulin to correct ketoacidosis. Liver and renal functions returned to normal after albumin infusion and hydration. Based upon blood culture results, Cefoperazone sulbactam was upgraded to meropenem. Inflammatory indicators and body temperature gradually returned to normal, and abdominal pain was relieved. Repeated blood cultures were negative, and urine culture remained negative. Repeated urinary CT scans revealed multiple stones in the right kidney with worsening right hydronephrosis and pyelonephritis, but with reduced gas accumulation (Fig. ).\nOne month after discharge, the patient underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the department of urology, and the urinary CT was reexamined after operation (Fig. ).Two months after discharge, the patient underwent the second percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the department of urology, and the urinary CT was reexamined after operation (Fig. ).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 122.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 122.1 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 122.1 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 122.1 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 122.1 mmol sodium/L converts to 122.1 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 35.95 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 35.95 mmol. To convert 35.95 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 35.95 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.036 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.036 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 6.486 g glucose. To convert 6.486 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 6.486 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 6486.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 6486.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 648.6 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 35.95 mmol glucose/L converts to 648.6 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 122.1 mEq/L + 0.024 * (648.6 - 100) = 135.266 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 135.266 mEq/L.",

He was a nonsmoker, did not endorse regular alcohol use, and denied any illicit drug use. His family history was noncontributory. His vitals at presentation were temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen Saturation 93% on room air. Home medications included bumetanide 1 mg daily, metolazone 1.25 mg twice a week, carvedilol 12.5 mg daily, and dabigatran 75 mg twice a day. Complete blood count (CBC) was unremarkable, and basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed creatinine of 2.2 mg/dl (near baseline). NT-pro-BNP was elevated at 18,500 pg/ml (baseline 2000s). Troponin was elevated at 0.36 ng/ml.\nUrology was consulted, and patient underwent cystoscopic evaluation for hematuria. Clot evacuation and fulguration of diffuse bladder lesions were performed. Bladder biopsy was also obtained, and subepithelial amyloid deposits were identified based on Congo-red stain.\nIn the following days, the patient developed intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hypotension, liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) peaked at 3000 (U/L) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) at 2000 (U/L). Remaining liver function tests showed alkaline phosphatase 50 (U/L), bilirubin 3-4 mg/dl, hyperammonemia (72 mcmol/L) and elevated international normalized ration (INR) around 4. Computed tomography imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for any acute process but showed cardiomegaly that was seen in the plain chest radiography as well. Workup for any acute infectious or inflammatory processes (viral markers, acetaminophen levels, and autoimmune markers) for evaluation of acute liver dysfunction did not reveal any alternate diagnosis, thereby suggesting acute decompensation from shock liver.\nEchocardiogram demonstrated worsening of ejection fraction (EF) to 10–15% with concentric left ventricle hypertrophy, impaired left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, thickened interventricular septum more than 12 mm, normal biventricular dimensions, biatrial dilation with no significant valvular abnormalities (findings compatible with cardiac amyloidosis) (). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was not performed due to underlying CKD. His condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to the cardiac care unit for acute decompensated heart failure. He was started on milrinone infusion with transient improvement in his cardiac function and end organ perfusion.\nHe was evaluated for cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade but deemed unstable from medical standpoint to undergo the procedure.\nHematology team was consulted and performed biochemical workup for amyloidosis. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) did not show an M-spike. Serum-free light analysis (kappa/lambda ratio 2.9) and urine immunofixation studies were not significant ruling out evidence for plasma cell dyscrasias. Meanwhile, the mass spectrometry analysis of the bladder biopsy specimen confirmed wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) consistent with senile systemic amyloidosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was not performed as mass spectrometry has been demonstrated to be a well-validated technique to diagnose and classify amyloidosis [, ]. Genetic testing can help clarify if the disease was hereditary or not but was not performed in this case and remains a limitation.\nMultiple specialties including internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, and critical care were involved in the patient care, but despite aggressive management, patient's condition gradually deteriorated. Due to the poor prognosis in the setting of multiple comorbidities and decompensated heart failure, the patients' family decided to stop further treatment and focus on patients comfort only which was facilitated by the palliative care team.

The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 35.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 35.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.5 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 35.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 3.5 g Albmumin/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 116.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 116.0 mmol. To convert 116.0 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 116.0 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.116 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.116 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 4.649 g Calcium. To convert 4.649 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 4.649 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 4649.0 mg Calcium.

The concentration value of 116.0 mmol Calcium/L converts to 464.9 mg Calcium/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.5 g/dL)) + 464.9 mg/dL = 465.3 mg/dL.

He complained of abdominal pain and inability to move his legs beginning five hours prior to arrival. He awakened from a nap that afternoon and experienced numbness in both legs, which progressed to paralysis. At baseline, he was ambulatory without any history of weakness and was last ambulatory hours prior. He endorsed occasional pain in his legs when walking at baseline.\nHe also complained of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting for two days. He had a history of alcohol use and reported dark-colored emesis and last bowel movement three days prior. On review of symptoms the patient denied any history of headache, dizziness, chest pain, back pain, trauma, fevers, or extremity weakness. He walked longer than a mile the day prior. History from the patient’s wife revealed that he had an episode of altered level of consciousness while on the couch and that finding combined with his abdominal pain and paralysis prompted her to call 911. The patient’s past medical history was significant for hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction 10 years prior. His past surgical history included “abdominal stents” and a left carotid stent. His social history was significant for a 25-pack/year history of smoking and daily alcohol. His medications included atenolol and ranitidine.\nPhysical exam showed an oral temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure 107/65mmHg, heart rate 99 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, with oxygen saturation on 15L non-rebreather mask of 94%. His weight was 72.5kg and he appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, cooperative and in moderate distress, primarily complaining of pain and cramping in his lower extremities and repeatedly asking staff to straighten out his legs although they were already lying straight and motionless on the gurney. His head exam was unremarkable with the exception of a dry oropharynx. Cervical spine, cardiac, and lung exams were unremarkable. His abdomen was firm and diffusely tender to palpation with generalized rebound and guarding. An irreducible left inguinal hernia was present. He had vomiting, and placement of a nasogastric tube revealed 1.5 liters of coffee-ground emesis. Lower extremities were thin, cool, and without any palpable or Dopplerable pulses in bilateral femoral, popliteal or pedal distribution. There was trace non-reproducible sensation to the mottled lower extremities, and no sensation distal to the ankles. Motor exam was significant for lower extremity paralysis.\nLaboratory data consisted of sodium 121mEq/L (135–145), potassium 6.8mEq/L (3.3–4.8), chloride 89mEq/L (101–111), CO2 18mEq/L (25–34), BUN 31mg/dL (8–26), creatinine 1.5mg/dL (0.5–1.3), and blood glucose 367mg/dL (70–115). White blood cell 19.1thous/mcL (4.0–10.5), hemoglobin 12.8g/dL (13.5–16.9), lipase 107U/L (22–51), hematocrit 38.8% (39.5–50.0), and platelets 165thous/mcL (150–400). There was a left shift in the neutrophils 16.2thous/mcL (85%) (2.0–8.1). Alkaline phosphate 88IU/L (26–110), AST 84IU/L (8–40), ALT 38IU/L (0.0–60), total bilirubin 1mg/dL (0.0–1.4), total protein 5.4g/dL (6.1–8.2), albumin 2.6g/dL (3.2–5.5). Lactate 7.2mmol/L (0.7–2.1). ABG showed pH of 7.25 (7.38–7.42), pCO2 31.6mmHg (36–42), pO2 123.6mmHg (80–104), bicarbonate 13.5mmol/L (21–27). PT was 17.3sec (9.5–12.3), PTT 45.9sec (24.1–35.1), and INR 1.62 (0.87–1.14). B-type natriuretic peptide 1,950pg/mL (<100). Troponin 2.75ng/mL (<0.03).\nChest radiograph was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 95 beats/minute with ST elevation inferiorly, anteriorly and laterally (). Bedside ultrasound to evaluate the abdominal aorta was limited. Vascular surgery was consulted prior to CT for concern of a vascular catastrophe. Cardiology was consulted for the patient’s ECG findings consistent with myocardial infarction. The patient went for a non-contrast head CT that was unremarkable and a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which was significant for the abdominal aorta with no contrast opacification 2.2cm superior to the bifurcation (), high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery, complete occlusion of the left common iliac artery, stents in the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), evidence of occlusion of the proximal SMA and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), hepatic, splenic, bilateral renal infarctions, left inguinal hernia, bowel obstruction, pneumatosis intestinalis with evidence of ischemic bowel, and aspiration in the right lower lung. General surgery was consulted.\nThe cardiology service stated that the patient was not a candidate for cardiac catheterization and to start anticoagulation and low-dose aspirin if there was no contraindication or planned surgery. They also recommended thrombolytics for the diffuse thrombotic disease. The patient did have an echocardiography study that revealed an ejection fraction of 35% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. General surgery recommended comfort measures as he was not a surgical candidate. Vascular surgery commented that bypass would be futile and if patient survived, would be a candidate for extra-anatomical axillo-bifemoral bypass in the future. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for broad-spectrum antibiotics and a heparin drip and succumbed to his illness the following day. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 12-year-old boy presented with recurrent fever for more than 2 years and was referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2014. The recurrent fever began without obvious predisposition and lasted 4 to 14 days per attack. The intervals between episodes range from 4 to 20 days. Temperature peak was up to 40°C. No cough, expectoration, rash, joint pain, or other discomfort appeared. He was referred to local clinics and had been diagnosed with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection many times with positive EBV antibodies (EBV-Ab) and elevated plasma virus copies. Details of his physical examination, laboratory results, and therapies were unavailable.\nHe visited a hospital in Beijing owing to another fever in February 2014. Enlargement of lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly were discovered in physical examination. Assay of EBV-Ab and virus copies were performed, which indicated that IgA/early antigen (EA), IgA/viral capsid antigen (VCA), IgG/VCA, NA-IgG were positive and the virus copies were elevated to 3.45 × 10^5/mL. Diagnosis of EBV infection was made and then ganciclovir was employed, which ameliorated his symptoms and reduced the virus copies.\nIn May 2014, his fever relapsed and then he was referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for further treatment. Reviewing the history of the patient before the onset of recurrent fever, we found that he had frequent respiratory infections with twice a month. Physical examination indicated that his growth and development were within normal limits, weighing 38.5 kg and 146 cm in height (both in the range of the tenth percentile to the twenty-fifth percentile). Ichthyosis rash could be seen on his lower limbs. Several enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the anterior region of the neck. No erythema or exudate of the throat or enlargement of tonsils was observed. There were no obvious abnormalities with cardiopulmonary examination. On the abdominal physical examination, hepatomegaly was found with 2 cm below the ribs, medial hardness, and a clear margin. Spleen could not be palpated. No deformity of joints was found as well.\nOn laboratory examination, peripheral blood count showed a decreased number of neutrophils and proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils were inverse (63.2% and 25.9%, respectively). Acute phase reactants increased (erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 34 mm/h and C reactive protein was 15 mg/L). Liver function tests revealed slightly elevated glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (see Fig. ). Serum immunoglobulin was normal (IgG, 16.44 g/L; IgA, 5.24 g/L; IgM, 0.75 g/L) with decreased T cells in the peripheral blood (see Table ). Table summarizes the values of lymphocyte subsets changing with time and therapy. The numbers of CD3+ T cell especially the CD4+ T cell markedly decreased, while NK cell significantly increased. These abnormal results persisted despite treatment with cyclosporine A for 4 months from July 2015 to November 2015. Recombinant human interferon α-2a began to be used in November 2015 with a dose of 1 MU, 3 times a week. Four months later in February 2016, the above abnormality still existed despite the remission of his symptoms and improvement of other laboratory examinations. Dosage of recombinant human interferon α-2a was then added to 2 MU, 3 times a week. Henceforward, the values of lymphocyte subsets gradually returned to normal level. Positivity of EBV-Ab (see Table ) and elevated virus copies (1.5 × 10^6 copies/mL, see Fig. ) were observed. As we can see in Table , IgA/EA, IgA/VCA, IgG/VCA, NA-IgG were persistently positive no matter what treatment was used. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated hepatosplenomegaly (oblique diameter of right lobe of liver was 13.0 cm and spleen diameter was 14.3 cm). Cardiac ultrasound showed that he had patent ductus arteriosus.\nHis symptoms, abnormal signs, and laboratory indexes repeatedly occurred during the follow-up, which were improved with repeated treatment of ganciclovir. The diagnosis of CAEBV was established on the basis of diagnostics guideline proposed by Okano et al.[ The following aspects of our patient fulfilled the Okano guideline: recurrent infectious mononucleosis-like symptom include fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly; unusual pattern of anti-EBV antibodies with raised anti-VCA and anti-EA, and detection of increased EBV genomes in the peripheral blood; and exclusion of other chronic illness such as other infections, autoimmune diseases, and neoplastic diseases upon completion of related examinations.\nThe repeated use of ganciclovir could not prevent the frequent relapses of EBV infection for our patient. The combination of cyclosporine A for 4 months could not reduce the virus copies to normal level as well. With the possibility of immunodeficiency disease, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to analyze all known PID genes followed by Sanger sequencing to verify results. The patient possessed 2 novel compound heterozygous mutations of JAK3 (see Fig. ). The p.H27Q mutation came from his father, while p. R222H from his mother. Thus, his diagnosis was corrected for JAK3-deficiency PID and CAEBV. Antiviral therapy was replaced with subcutaneous injection of recombinant human interferon α-2a with 1 to 2 MU, 3 times a week since November 2015. The virus copies gradually decreased to the normal level and his symptoms ameliorated significantly. Moreover, ALT decreased to normal level after 3 months. His latest follow-up was in February 2017. He has hardly had a fever for nearly 1 year and the virus copies and ALT were normal. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

She was first diagnosed with HCV exposure in 2005 with genotype 3a and had undergone pegylated interferon monotherapy weekly for six months. She achieved end of treatment response. Subsequently, she continued to use intravenous drugs. On presentation to our clinic on 05/04/2011, patient was found to have reinfection with genotype 1a with an HCV viral load of 29,000 IU/mL. She had no nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, or dysphagia. She had lost some weight but she was dieting. She denied any intravenous drug and alcohol use in last 3 years.\nHer past medical history was notable for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis, hyperlipidemia, diverticulosis, and Helicobacter pylori gastritis. There was no family history of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes or any other autoimmune diseases. She is a former smoker. Her medications included butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine, simvastatin, and esomeprazole.\nInitial physical examination showed temperature of 98.2°F, pulse of 72 beats/minute, BP of 116/70 mm/Hg, and weight of 146 pounds. Physical examination was normal “without stigmata of liver disease or malnutrition and so forth.”\nLaboratory data on initial visit showed normal complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP), and iron studies. Pt was found to have HCV viral load of 4,515,392 IU/ml and genotype 1a. Other causes of liver disease including hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, and HIV were ruled out. The patient underwent a liver biopsy which showed Metavir grade 2 inflammatory activity and stage 1 fibrosis ().\nColonoscopy was also done on 6/25/2008 at different facility, which did not show any polyps but showed diverticular disease of descending colon and sigmoid colon. The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) done on 10/7/2009 which was unremarkable.\nTreatment was initiated on dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a at 180 μg subcutaneous weekly plus ribavirin 600 mg orally twice per day for a 4-week lead-in phase, followed by triple therapy using boceprevir (BOC) 800 mg orally three times per day for total of 28 weeks. HCV viral loads which were collected at weeks 4, 8, 12, 21, and 24 were undetectable by polymerase chain reaction. During treatment, the patient developed neutropenia and anemia, which were treated with pegfilgrastim and darbepoetin alfa.\nApproximately 4 weeks after initiation of triple therapy the patient developed loose nonbloody bowel movements, which was not reported at the time. She experienced nausea and decreased appetite but no vomiting or abdominal pain. Occasionally she felt bloated. There was no fever, chills, or skin rash.\nThree months following cessation of treatment the patient complained of ongoing weakness and dyspnea on exertion which had begun after the initiation of therapy but which had not resolved completely. She had ten-pound weight loss during treatment which persisted, but she also now admitted to having 5-6 watery loose bowel movements for the preceding five months. Repeat CBC showed low hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (baseline 14 g/dL). The patient failed to give stool samples for analysis. She underwent an EGD and colonoscopy. During EGD, mucosa in the stomach and second and third part of duodenum appeared normal but biopsies from second portion of the duodenum revealed mild villous blunting, mild crypt hyperplasia, and minimal intraepithelial lymphocytes consistent with CD ().

She had no prior history of abdominal surgery or trauma. She had a difficult partial cholecystectomy due to severe inflammation in the Calot’s triangle, large empyema in the gall bladder and, excessive bleeding during difficult dissection between gall bladder and liver bed. Subtotal cholecystectomy was done as the cystic duct could not be isolated. The physical examination revealed a conscious woman who’s had a temperature 37 degree C, a pulse rate 90 beats per minute (bpm), a blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. The abdominal examination revealed a right upper scar without abdominal tenderness. There were no palpable masses or liver enlargement. Laboratory data revealed an hematocrit of 41%, an hemoglobin of 12,6 g/dl, white blood cells of 11,100/mm³ (83% neutrophils), a blood urea of 0,25 g/L, and a creatinine level of 10 mg/L. Liver enzymes showed a total bilirubin of 13 mg/L with a direct component of 6 mg/L; SGOT and SGPT were 87 U/L and 166 U/L, respectively (normal range for SGOT is 17–59 U/L and for SGPT is 21–72 U/L).

The patient denied syncope and dizziness but had occasional palpitations on exertion.\nThe patient was taking bendroflumethazide only for hypertension, having found her chest pain worsened on losartan.\nOn examination, height was 163 cm, weight 57 kg, blood pressure was 157/74 mmHg, heart rate 75 b.p.m., and oxygen saturations were 98%. Her jugular venous pressure was not elevated, chest was clear and there was no peripheral oedema. There was a grade 2/6 pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval (220 ms) and right bundle branch block (QRS duration 160 ms) (). A 24 h Holter monitoring showed sinus rhythm with first degree heart block throughout, 54–104 b.p.m., with occasional runs of ventricular bigeminy and premature ventricular complexes. Full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal.\nTransthoracic echocardiography performed in 2014 showed a small, non-hypertrophied left ventricle with normal function. The commissure of the posterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve was significantly apically displaced (42 mm), resulting in a large atrialized component of the right ventricle. The anterior leaflet was large and redundant. There was severe TR. Aortic and mitral valve morphology was normal. There was no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The aortic annulus was small and there was turbulent flow through the left ventricular outflow (LVOT) due to the abnormal motion of the atrialized portion of the right ventricle in systole, resulting in a peak velocity through the LVOT of 2.6 m/s at rest, increasing to 3.5 m/s post-Valsalva (peak gradient 27 mmHg at rest and 48 mmHg post-Valsava) (, Video S1).\nGiven the patient’s cardiovascular risk profile, computed tomography of the coronary arteries was undertaken, which was normal.\nSymptoms persisted and worsened with an objective deterioration in functional capacity over a 5-month period, based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing done (VO2max: 24.3 mL/kg/min—METS 6.9 in July vs. VO2max: 18.7 mL/kg/min—METS 5.3 in December with a reduced oxygen pulse).\nA year later a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase in the right ventricular end-diastolic volume over a 12-month period, from 123 mL/m2 (ejection fraction 64%) to 146 mL/m2 (ejection fraction 57%). The tricuspid regurgitant fraction increased from 32% to 52%.\nTransoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) was performed to explore the LVOT anatomy in 2015. Post-TOE, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a resting peak velocity of 1.9 m/s across the LVOT, which increased to 5.2 m/s (incomplete Doppler envelope) with leg raising (). No atrial septal defects were identified. In the same year, an exercise stress echocardiography showed a significant increase in peak gradient to 157 mmHg and a peak flow velocity through the LVOT from 2.1 m/s (mean gradient 12 mmHg) at rest to 6.3 m/s (mean gradient 95 mmHg) at peak stress at very low workload (25 W) ().\nLosartan was switched to verapamil 80 mg three times daily due to the chest pain being worse on losartan. The mechanism for this was felt to be myocardial ischaemia due to exacerbation of the LVOTO secondary to reduction of the systemic vascular resistance and therefore reduction in coronary blood flow. We felt that verapamil might reduce any dynamic LVOTO in a manner similar to that in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. She was also prescribed indapamide 2.5 mg once a day instead of bendroflumethazide with good blood pressure control.\nThe patient’s case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary meeting and the decision was made to proceed to cardiac surgery for tricuspid valve repair or replacement in the hope that this would reduce the LVOTO and some LVOTO resection if possible.\nDue to the rarity of the condition, the patient has chosen not to have surgery and is currently seeking several opinions worldwide. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

The uterus appeared small in size. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) of abdomen, plain and contrast, showed a large well-defined heterogeneously enhancing predominantly fat attenuating lesion measuring 9.5 cm × 8.7 cm × 8.0 cm involving the right adrenal gland. The lesion demonstrated multifocal area of nodular calcification with enhancing solid component and was seen compressing the superolateral aspect of the right kidney with the minimal inferomedial displacement [Figure and ]. Blood tests were carried out for functional assessment of the right adrenal tumor. Serum testosterone level was raised to 2.24 ng/ml. Serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone, 17 hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone and cortisol levels as well as urinary 17 keto steroids, 17 hydroxy corticosteriods and vanilylmandelic acid levels were normal. A clinical diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma was made and right adrenalectomy was performed. The specimen showed an encapsulated tumor measuring 10 cm × 8 cm × 7 cm []. Microscopic examination showed compressed adrenal tissue with foci of hemorrhage within the well- encapsulated tumor. The tumor nodules were primarily composed of eosinophilic lipid poor cells resembling zona reticularis. Mitotic rate was <5/50 hpf. No atypical mitosis was seen. The tumor nodules were separated by bands of hyalinized fibrous tissue containing proliferating thick walled vessels, hemorrhagic foci and sparse lymphocytic infiltrate.

His prior medical conditions included longstanding Crohn's disease, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He had undergone previous abdominal surgery for the complication of small intestinal obstruction due to Crohn's disease in 2017. On initial evaluation, he had a blood pressure of 159/74 mmHg, pulse of 84 per minute, respiratory rate of 18 per minute, oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) of 98% on room air, and body weight 125 pounds. On physical examination, the patient was noted to have a mildly tense and tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sound. The fluid thrill and shifting dullness were negative.\nHis blood work revealed creatinine of 1.27 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 27 mg/dL, sodium of 147 mmol/L, potassium of 3.6 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L, bilirubin of 2.3 mg/dL, lactate of 1.3 mg/dL, cardiac troponins of <0.10 (normal), WBC of 22,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin of 14.2 mg/dL. Imaging studies included CT abdomen and pelvis, which showed a markedly distended stomach filled with the enteric contrast, rotated in mesenteroaxial (MA) rotation, and localized fluid in the left upper quadrant with the caudal displacement of the spleen due to left upward stomach (Figures , ). The gastric outflow tract was pinched to the left of the midline superior to the esophagogastric junction related to the gastric volvulus, with a small amount of contrast material passing into the small intestine, suggesting a short segment of focal narrowing at the level of antrum or proximal duodenum (Figures , ). This was consistent with the diagnosis of gastric volvulus. After the initial resuscitation, the gastroenterologist decided to perform endoscopic detorsion, which was unsuccessful due to the twisting of the distal stomach in the antrum and stricture at the level of the antrum. The area was traversed multiple times without achieving clear untwisting due to adhesions.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laparoscopy was performed to find a redundant stomach without adhesions or masses. The stomach was detorsed. The gastroenterologist was consulted in the operating room and endoscopy was performed. The narrowing at the junction of the antrum and proximal duodenum was identified. Gastric and duodenal mucosa were healthy, without lesions or masses, and gastropexy was performed.

He also reported occasional episodes of nausea and nonbloody diarrhea. He denied any fevers, chills, or rash but reported some arthralgias. The patient was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, but had lived in Texas, USA, since age seven. He was divorced, estranged from his children, and lived alone. There was no significant tobacco or alcohol use but he confirmed exposure to high intensity dust when he used to work in a ceramic and tile factory without wearing a mask for the last five years.\nHe was evaluated by a private community physician a few days before presentation to our hospital who prescribed for him a combination of oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole without specific diagnostic testing. The patient did not have any improvement so he presented to the emergency room.\nIn the emergency department, his temperature was 98.3 F, blood pressure 84/61 mmHg, pulse rate 128/minute, and respiratory rate 27/minute with pulse oximetry 92% on ambient air. He was acutely ill-looking but alert. While lung examination was limited on admission due to COVID-19 restrictions and the use of disposable stethoscopes, there were decreased air sounds but no rales. His abdominal examination was benign but positive findings were significant for large lymph nodes in the cervical, supraclavicular, inguinal, and axillary areas, some measuring more than 3 cm in diameter. Laboratory findings on admission showed white blood cell count was 8,900/mm3 with 80% neutrophils, 0.5% band forms, and 11% eosinophils, hemoglobin was 8.9 gm/dL, hematocrit was 27.6%, and platelet count was 447,000/mm3. Electrolytes showed bicarbonate of 17, blood urea 54, creatinine 1.5, albumin 2.2, lipase 14, lactic acid 2.5, ALT 57, and AST 139. Procalcitonin was 6.1.\nHis chest film on admission showed a diffuse micronodular pattern which triggered testing for COVID-19 which turned out to be negative. CT scan of the chest without contrast revealed extensive diffuse bilateral micronodules in a miliary pattern, mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy with pericardial thickening, while the CT scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed enlarged lymph nodes in the para-aortic, gastrohepatic, inguinal, external, and internal iliac chains (Figures and ). While the patient was seen by many physicians to rule out lymphoma and tuberculosis, as well as to manage his respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and septic shock, the infectious disease physician suspected coccidioidomycosis and began a work up for the patient with serologic testing.\nSince he was in shock, blood and urine cultures were sent and he was treated with IV isotonic fluid resuscitation with empiric intravenous vancomycin and cefepime along with intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg every 8 hours and admitted to the intensive unit. Further testing showed that he was positive for HIV-1 with viral load 309,000 and CD4 count 38. We did not begin antifungal medications at the outset because we did not have a diagnosis of HIV at the time. Upon a diagnosis of HIV in the hospital, we expanded our differentials to miliary tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Histoplasmosis antigen, acid fast bacilli (AFB), and Cryptococcus antibody tests did not yield a positive result; however, sputum culture was positive for Candida albicans. Despite aggressive treatment with vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy, the patient died on hospital day 3. The family agreed to an autopsy which showed diffuse coccidioidomycosis with negative AFB stain and no evidence of malignancy. The cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to disseminated coccidioidomycosis secondary to HIV/AIDS infection.\nAt autopsy, there were bilateral pleural lung effusions (left: 300ml, right: 400ml), congestion of the lungs with areas of consolidation, and extensive intra-alveolar edema. There were innumerable diffuse tan nodules showing miliary spread in the upper and lower lung lobes with predominance in the upper lobes in the lungs bilaterally (see Figures and . These nodules microscopically consisted of granulomatous inflammation. The lung alveolar spaces were filled with proteinaceous material and Coccidioides fungal microorganisms. Coccidioides fungal microorganisms have spherules that may be empty or filled with endospores. Coccidioides fungal microorganisms are accentuated with Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver stain (GMS) (see Figures and ).The decedent grossly had extensive cervical, supraclavicular, inguinal, and axillary lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes grossly showed a cut tan surface (see ). Microscopically, normal lymph node architecture was replaced with caseating granulomas with Coccidioides fungal microorganisms that are accentuated with Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver stain (GMS) (See Figures and ). It should be noted that acid fast bacilli (AFB) stain was performed and was negative for acid fast microorganisms on both lung and lymph node sections.\nAutopsy Findings and Figures are presented in . </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 64 year-old Caucasian female former smoker (4 pack-year) originally presented to the emergency department with painless jaundice. Physical exam revealed an afebrile female with scleral icterus and jaundice. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended in all quadrants with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. CT imaging demonstrated a large (10 cm) retroperitoneal mass, necessitating biliary stenting. Fine needle aspiration of the mass revealed a CD10+clonal B cell population by flow cytometry, consistent with presumptive B cell lymphoma. During the staging workup for the lymphoma, right-sided cervical level IIA and III lymphadenopathy was found incidentally during a routine dental check-up, which was initially thought to be of the same disease process. She had no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. CT demonstrated right level II/III LN and possible right base of tongue (BOT) mass. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed an exophytic mass involving the right BOT that extended to the right glosso-tonsillar sulcus and beyond the midline measuring approximately 3 cm (Fig. ). Excisional biopsy of two right cervical lymph nodes unexpectedly demonstrated squamous cell cancer (SCC) that was positive for p16 and HPV. Subsequently, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated an FDG-avid right BOT mass (2.3 × 0.9 cm) with right-sided level IIA, IIB and III lymphadenopathy (all < 3 cm), consistent with biopsy-proven HPV-associated SCC (Fig. ). There was also an intensely FDG-avid retroperitoneal mass (8.2 × 13.4 × 10.7 cm) along with left mesenteric, left periaortic, and left retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Fig. ). Laparoscopic biopsy of gastroepiploic, mesenteric, and gastrocolic lymph nodes confirmed follicular lymphoma. Pathology showed relatively low number of centroblasts (fewer than 15 per high power field) compatible with low grade follicular lymphoma (WHO grade 1–2) with significantly elevated Ki-67 proliferation index (~ 80%) suggesting clinical behavior similar to WHO grade 3 follicular lymphoma. Omentum and liver were not involved. Therefore, a diagnosis of synchronous stage IV T2N2bM0 HPV+ SCC of right BOT and stage IIAX follicular lymphoma was made. At the time, she was relatively asymptomatic from the BOT cancer. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, trismus, otalgia, or speech or voice change. She also denied night sweats, fevers, significant weight loss, or infectious symptoms. Videofluoroscopic swallow study evaluation was normal. ECOG performance status was 1. After stenting, the patient’s bilirubin normalized and she was asymptomatic. Her case was discussed at multidisciplinary case conferences, and the initial plan was to treat the BOT cancer first due to its likely curability and shorter treatment course.\nOne month later, however, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of worsening abdominal pain. Given concern for lymphoma becoming increasingly symptomatic, R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy was initiated. She tolerated therapy well and had resolution of abdominal pain. After completion of 3 cycles of R-CHOP, PET/CT scan demonstrated interval markedly decreased size and uptake of the retroperitoneal mass, as well as interval resolution of the FDG-avid BOT lesion, and most of the FDG-avid cervical lymph nodes (Figs. and ). She had no symptoms referable to lymphoma at this time. Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy also revealed no residual fullness in the area of the right BOT (Fig. ). After completion of another 3 cycles of R-CHOP (in total 6 cycles), PET/CT scan demonstrated sustained metabolic resolution of the abdominal mass. However, FDG-avid right BOT lesion as well as right cervical level II and III nodes had become slightly more prominent compared to the end of cycle 3. The decision was made to start 7-week concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 for the SCC. Unfortunately, she was found to be neutropenic and cisplatin was switched to cetuximab. At the end of the first cetuximab infusion, she developed a Grade 3 infusion reaction with rigors and chest pain and was diagnosed with NSTEMI. An attempt to re-initiate cisplatin treatment after ANC normalized was unsuccessful as patient experienced fever and altered mental status necessitating hospital admission. She had received a total of one dose of cetuximab and two doses of cisplatin before the decision was made to proceed with radiation therapy (RT) without further chemotherapy. In total, the patient received 6996 cGy, 212 cGy per day in 33 fractions with coverage of the oropharynx and bilateral neck using tomotherapy-based image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Despite experiencing significant anterior mouth sores from cetuximab early in treatment, as well as significant oropharynx mucositis late in treatment, she was ultimately able to complete RT without an enteral feeding tube. At 3-month follow-up, she had no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease on exam or PET/CT scan. At the time of this manuscript submission, 3 years after completion of the radiation therapy, she remained in remission for both cancers. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's HEART score? </Question>",

The sample was sent for karyotyping and Toxoplasmosis, Others (Syphilis, Varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes infection workup. However, the reports came back normal. Similarly, the fetal echo was normal with no other structural abnormalities. Subsequent scan at 31 weeks of gestation showed features of hydrops fetalis like polyhydramnios, pleural effusion, gross ascites, and skin and scalp edema. Bilateral lungs were hypoplastic, secondary to an elevated diaphragm. The small bowel was echogenic and matted. Internal echoes were present in the ascites. There was a history of perinatal asphyxia and developmental delay in the previous baby. Therefore, metabolic causes for hydrops fetalis were also a possibility.\nA 2,300 g hydropic female baby was delivered by caesarean section at 32 weeks of gestation suspecting preterm premature rupture of membranes. The baby did not cry at birth and required resuscitation in the form of positive pressure ventilation and intubation. The baby had scalp edema, generalized skin edema, ascites, and vulvar edema (). Her birth weight and head circumference were >90th percentile, and length was between the 10th–50th percentile according to the Fenton's growth chart.\nAbdominal radiograph revealed intra-abdominal calcification scattered over the bilateral hypochondrium and flanks (). Abdomen ultrasound revealed massive ascites with internal echoes suggestive of calcification and inferior vena cava compression. Based on these findings, meconium peritonitis was maintained as a working diagnosis. Emergency laparotomy and exploration were performed on the first day of life. Intra-operatively, there was a 10-cm perforation proximal to the ileocecal valve with matted bowel forming an abdominal cocoon with interloop adhesions. Meconium pellets were seen in the proximal ileum with calcifications over the liver, spleen, and bowel (). Ileal resection was performed with a double-barrel ileostomy. Histopathology of the resected bowel revealed the healed perforation with granulation tissue. Immunoreactive trypsinogen level was normal.\nThere is a very low incidence of cystic fibrosis in our local population and the parents in this case did not consent to further cystic fibrosis genetic workup.\nIleostomy started functioning.

At the time of diagnosis, her fasting plasma glucose was 140 mg/dL and her HbA1c was 7.0%; C-peptide levels were not evaluated. The patient’s blood glucose levels were well controlled with glimepiride (0.5–1 mg/day) and her HbA1c level had been 6.5% four months prior to the current visit. Three days before admission, her blood glucose levels had gradually increased to over 400 mg/dL, and her symptoms of polydipsia and general weakness worsened.\nThe patient was alert on admission, and her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per min, heart rate was 103 beats per min, and body temperature was 36.2°C. The patient’s height and weight were 155.4 cm and 60.5 kg, respectively, her body mass index (BMI) was 25.05 kg/m2, and she had not experienced any recent changes in weight. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap of 19.5 mEq/L. Her plasma glucose levels were elevated to 431 mg/dL, and her serum osmolality, urea, and creatinine were also slightly elevated. Urine testing was positive for glucose (3+) and ketones (3+) (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). To rule out infection and cancer, chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen were obtained, which showed no abnormal findings besides a moderately fatty liver.\nContinuous insulin infusion with fluid replacement was initiated to treat DKA. Glucose levels were measured hourly and the insulin-infusion rate was varied from 2.5 to 10 units per hour to maintain adequate blood glucose levels (150–200 mg/dL). After 10 hours of treatment, the patient recovered from metabolic acidosis with a pH, pCO2, and HCO3− of 7.40, 30 mmHg, and 18.6 mmol/L, respectively, as measured by ABGA, and her anion gap recovered to normal levels. After resolution of DKA, her general condition improved and she was able to start a diet treatment. At that time, her insulin therapy was changed to a basal bolus insulin regimen. Additional laboratory tests revealed that her HbA1c level was 7.0% and her fasting C-peptide level was very low (0.01 pmol/mL). Serum pancreatic lipase was elevated (two times above the upper limit of normal), but amylase was normal. Tests for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab), islet cell antibody (ICA), and insulin autoantibody (IAA) were all negative. After her glucose levels stabilized with the basal bolus insulin regimen, the treatment was changed to premixed insulin. She was discharged on an insulin regimen consisting of 56 units of Novomix 30 FlexPen (70% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 30% insulin aspart) before breakfast and 20 units of Novomix 30 FlexPen before dinner. Three months after discharge, her HbA1c level had increased to 8.4% and her blood glucose levels were poorly controlled despite maintenance of the mixed split therapy. She achieved and maintained good glycemic control after her insulin regimen was changed to multiple injections.

For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.181 (in inches) - 60) = 48.216 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 48.216 kg.The patient's weight is 60.5 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 48.216 kg + 0.4 * (60.5 kg  - 48.216 kg) = 53.13 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 53.13 kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A male infant presented with vomiting, abdominal distension and watery diarrhea at the age of 2 weeks old. His vomiting was aggravated when he was 1 month old, and the episodes of vomiting were often occurred after feeding. At 2 months of age, he was admitted to our department. He was the first child of his mother, and he was born at term with a birth weight of 2.95 kg after an uneventful pregnancy. The parents were nonconsanguineous and healthy. There were no similar diseases occurred in his family history. When he was admitted, he had severe malnutrition, while his vital signs were stable. His weight was 3.42 kg, and the Z score of the weight for age (ZWFA) was below -3SD; his length was 55.5 cm, and the Z score of the height for age (ZHFA) was below -2SD. He had stable breathing, and lungs auscultation was normal, the rhythm and strength of the heart beat were normal. Neither abdominal tenderness nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed. No edema was observed. The complete blood count showed the following: a white blood cell count of 10.58 × 109/L (65.7% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin level of 105 g/L, a platelet count of 628 × 109 /L, a hypersensitive C-reactive protein level of 3 mg/L. The immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were within the normal range: Ig G 6 g/L, Ig A 0.36 g/L, Ig M 0.3 g/L, and Ig E < 17.9 IU/mL, and the serum albumin level and liver function were normal. The stool etiology examinations were all negative. Blood Analysis of blood tandem mass spectrometry did not indicate any metabolic disease. Gastrointestinal contrast revealed a horizontal transverse stomach and the ileum was segmental slightly extended. The patient was diagnosed with intestinal malabsorptive syndrome, severe malnutrition and growth failure according to the clinical and laboratory findings.\nThe patient was given partial parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition with deep-hydrolysis formula during hospitalization. The daily amount of the stool was between 30 g per kilogram to 40 g per kilogram, and the largest amount of stool was 80 g per kilogram every day. The amount of stool decreased after hospitalization for 13 months, however there was only a minimal gain of weight from 3.42 kg to 4.88 kg, and the body height increased from 55.5 cm to 64.3 cm. The child was advised to perform an endoscopy procedure and genetic tests for suspecting congenital diarrhea and enteropathy. However, his parents refused to perform these examinations strongly. When he was discharged at 1-year-3-month old, the amount of formula he can take was about 700 ml per day. He was advised to continue parenteral nutrition treatment intermittently, but his parents did not take the doctor’s advice.\nWhen the patient was 1 year and 6 months old, his diarrhea increased again. The episodes of stool were about five to six times a day. His mother added rice paste in his diet when he was 1 year and 8 months old. Half a month later, an edema was observed in the lower limbs and he had coughing as well. He was taken to the emergency room and the blood testing found hypoglycemia with blood glucose level of 1.2 mmol/L. Laboratory examinations showed the following: slightly decreased potassium ion level of 3.4 mmol/L, normal sodium ion level was normal, decreased calcium ion level of 0.56 mmol/L; a white blood cells count was 9.01 × 109 /L (49.4% lymphocytes), a hemoglobin level was 122 g/L, platelets count was 202 × 109 /L, normal hypersensitive C-reactive protein of 3 mg/L, normal serum albumin level of 34.4 g/L, slightly increased total bilirubin level of 31.0 μmol/L, increased alanine aminotransferase level of 119 U/L, an increased hypersensitive troponin T level of 0.165 ng/mL, an increased N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide level more than 35,000 pg/mL. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia, multiple fractures of the ribs, narrowing of vertebral bodies and osteoporosis of various bones. An Echo ultrasound revealed decreased systolic function of left ventricular with EF level of 0.39. After admission, his general condition deteriorated quickly, and he developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. Finally, he had cardiac arrest and he needed repeated cardiopulmonary resuscitation. His parents gave up further treatment at last.\nDue to intractable diarrhea, growth failure and intestinal absorptive dysfunction, he was strongly suspected to have congenital diarrhea and entropy. He was advised to perform the genetic test again. Therefore, peripheral heparin anticoagulation blood was taken from him and his parents, and exon detection V2 which included over 4400 genes was performed at Beijing Mackinaw Medical Laboratory. The candidate genes of primary immunodeficiency diseases prone to refractory diarrhea including IL-2 receptor common gamma chain, ZAP70, ORAI-1 and ITK, and those also associated with congenital diarrheas and enteropathies such as DGAT1, SKIV2L, TTC7A, MYO5B, FOXP3, STAT3, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB, NEMO, and STAT1 et al. were all analyzed. Genetic analysis revealed: two disease-related gene mutations in this patient, one homozygous mutation of EpCAM gene and the nucleotide number 491 + 1 in the coding region was changed from guanine to adenine, resulting in amino acid changes. One splicing mutation was derived from his mother, and his father was suspected to have a heterozygous deletion mutation of the gene. This homozygous gene mutation was associated with CTE and was functionally verified to be a causative gene []. The second mutation was a TTC7A gene complex heterozygous mutation, c.291_292insTACG, which was derived from his mother. He also had a mutation of c.335G > A, which was derived from his father. The compound heterozygous mutation was a suspected pathogenic mutation associated with multiple intestinal atresia (MIA) and chronic diarrhea. The patient was diagnosed with CTE (MIM 613217) in combination of clinical manifestations and genetic testing results. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.\nClinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35–7.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32–45 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83–108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21–26 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5–1.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98–106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136–146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5–5.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15–1.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70–105 mg/dl]).\nUltrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).\nLaboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/μl).\nWe suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.\nSince there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.123",
    "Upper Limit": "0.135",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 130.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 130.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 130.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 52.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 52.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 52.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 52.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 52.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 52.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 72.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 72.2 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 72.2 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 72.2 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 72.2 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 72.2 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 130.0 mEq/L - (52.0 mEq/L + 72.2 mEq/L) = 5.8 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 5.8 mEq/L. Plugging in 5.8 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 5.8 - 12 = -6.2 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -6.2 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -6.2 mEq/L / -48.2 mEq/L = 0.129. The patient's delta ratio is 0.129.",

Fourteen years before presentation, she noticed protrusion of her right ankle but did not undergo evaluation at a hospital. Eight years before presentation, at age 19, she experienced acute pain and swelling of her right ankle. The pain resolved spontaneously but recurred 6 to 7 times/year, involving the bilateral metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, bilateral ankles, and right knee. Her serum urate level (SUA) was elevated to 789 μmol/L. A diagnosis of gout was made, and she was prescribed NSAIDs for pain relief and allopurinol and benzbromarone to lower her urate level. However, she discontinued allopurinol and benzbromarone on her own as these medications triggered acute flares. Five years before presentation, she noticed multiple nodules in her MTP joints, ankles, and fingers. The nodules on her feet interfered with normal walking. She also complained of the inability to conceive after 3 years of attempts. Her age at menarche was 14 years, and her cycles were irregular. She was reported to prefer snacks and fatty food during her childhood. Her father had hypertension. Her grandfather had an SUA level greater than 400 μmol/L but without gout. On physical examination, the patient was generally healthy, with a height of 168 cm and a weight of 55 kg. Her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. On abdominal palpation, the liver was enlarged with a normal soft texture. A joint examination revealed multiple nodules on the bilateral MTP1 joints, ankles, and fingers.\nA serological examination after overnight fasting revealed a SUA level of 548 μmol/L, serum creatinine (Cr) level of 49 μmol/L, fasting glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, total triglyceride level of 6.22 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 6.60 mmol/L. Her resting lactate level was 7.4 mmol/L. Her 24-h urine urate level was 2.262 mmol/24 h, and her fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) was 2.48 %. Her liver enzymes were normal. The estrogen level and basal body temperature curve were normal for her age and menstrual status. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal kidney size with possible calcium deposits in the bilateral renal medulla. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen showed hepatomegaly without nodules. The pelvic ultrasonography and salpingography findings were normal. Serum examinations of her parents and her husband were normal.\nWhole blood DNA was extracted from all four family members (the patient, both parents, and her husband) after signing an informed consent form. A genetic study was first conducted with a target gene sequencing approach. A search of the OMIM, NIH, and PubMed databases using the key words “FEMALE,” “GOUT,” and “HYPERLACTACIDEMIA” indicated familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, glycogen storage disease type I, and glycogen storage disease type II. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence each of the exons of the UMOD, RENIN, G6PC, SLC37A4, and GAA genes, as well as two SNP loci (rs2231142 and rs72552713) of ABCG2 found in our previous report of a family including a female with gout.\nThe genetic sequencing results showed that UMOD, RENIN, SLC37A4, GAA and rs72552713 of ABCG2 were all normal in the patient and her family. Sequencing of the G6PC gene revealed composite heterozygous c.190G>T/c.508C>T mutations in the patient, a heterozygous c.190G>T mutation in her father, and a heterozygous c.508C>T mutation in her mother. The genetic analysis of her husband was normal. The c.190G>T mutation was located on exon 1 and encoded a missense mutation of p.V64L, whereas the c.508C>T mutation was located on exon 4 and encoded a nonsense mutation of p.R170X (Fig. ).

There were no comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. cART, comprising lamivudine, abacavir and atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg of atazanavir boosted by 100 mg of ritonavir), was started to treat his low CD4+ T-cell count (205 cells/μL) and high HIV-RNA (230 000 copies/mL) in June 2006. Soon after the initiation of cART, both proteinuria and hematuria emerged (1+ and 1+ on dipstick test, respectively) and his renal function started to decline slowly, yet there were no crystalline precipitates in the urine. Serum creatinine (Cr) increased from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL in June 2009, and to 1.4 mg/dL in February 2012, with persistent proteinuria (1+) and occult hematuria (2+) on a dipstick test. As serum Cr increased to 1.7 mg/dL, he was admitted to the Department of Nephrology in April 2012. The cART regimen remained unchanged, since the control of HIV infection was good at the time.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 102/78 mmHg and pulse rate 98 beats per minute. His height was 154 cm and his weight was 35.4 kg (body mass index, 14.9 kg/m2). There were no particular abnormalities on physical examination. The blood data were as follows: white blood cell count 6400/μL; red blood cell count 387 × 104/μL; hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL; platelet count 27.0 × 104/μL; serum urea nitrogen 21 mg/dL; serum Cr 1.7 mg/dL; serum sodium 139 mEq/L; serum potassium 4.5 mEq/L; serum chloride 103 mEq/L and serum C-reactive protein 0.49 mg/dL. Urine dipstick test showed pH 6.0, proteinuria (1+), and occult blood (3+). The urinary concentrations of biomarkers for tubular damage, which was corrected for urinary Cr concentrations, were as follows: N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), 12.0 IU/gCr (normal level of NAG concentration, 0.0–7.0 IU/L) and β2M, 391 μg/gCr (normal level of β2M concentration, 27–265 μg/L), respectively. The daily amount of urinary protein was 250 mg. Urinary sediments included 50–99 red blood cells/high power field (HPF), 20–29 white blood cells/HPF and small amounts of crystalline precipitation (no detail for its shape). Infrared spectroscopic analysis was implemented to test whether the urinary crystalline precipitation included atazanavir crystals. In brief, the patient's urine was stored for 24 h, and some of the urine was centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was used for infrared spectroscopic analysis, and the spectrum of the infrared absorbance was compared with that of the standard for atazanavir analysis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). This analysis strongly indicated that the urinary crystalline precipitation of the patient included atazanavir crystals (Figure ). The first renal biopsy was performed in May 2012. The kidney tissue contained eight glomeruli, one of which (12.5%) was globally sclerotic. The remaining glomeruli showed no convincing histological changes indicating renal failure. In contrast, interstitial nephritis, accompanied by diffuse inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, was noted (Figure A). Moreover, needle-shaped crystalline precipitation, likely in the epithelia of the tubule, surrounded by multinuclear giant cells, was very characteristic (Figure B). Immunohistochemistry was negative. Electron microscopy showed no electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli; however, crystalline precipitation was confirmed within the tubular epithelial cells (Figure C). In June 2012, atazanavir was replaced by raltegravir, but renal function did not improve. From November 2012, 6 months after the first renal biopsy, oral prednisolone was started at the initial dose of 0.75 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks, and was slowly decreased in the subsequent 5 months. However, serum Cr remained constant at 1.5 mg/dL. In August 2013 (1 year and 3 months after the first renal biopsy), a second renal biopsy contained 28 glomeruli, 5 of which (17.9%) were globally sclerotic. The remaining 23 glomeruli had unremarkable changes. Needle-shaped crystals surrounded by lymphocytes and multinuclear giant cells in the tubulointerstitial compartment were completely removed. Sclerotic findings of glomeruli and intrarenal arterioles including interlobular arteries were more prominent than those observed in the first renal biopsy. Additionally, tubular atrophy and interstitial-fibrosis developed further, although the severe interstitial inflammation was almost cured (Figure D). Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed no characteristic findings. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 141.1 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 99.2 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 3.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 3.4 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 3.4 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 3.4 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.4 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 3.4 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.1 mEq/L - (99.2 mEq/L + 3.4 mEq/L) = 38.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 38.5 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> We describe a case of 50-year-old South Asian male with past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted for elective ureteroscopy under general anesthesia for ureteric stone. His home medications were aspirin 100 mg once daily, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, metformin 500 mg twice daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily, and pantoprazole 40 mg once daily. Additionally, he was prescribed levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 7 days which were completed on the day of admission. His medication refill history from the outpatient pharmacy was regular and implies compliance to his home medications. After cardiology consultation, his urologist held aspirin and clopidogrel 6 days prior to the procedure to minimize the risk of bleeding.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 100/62 mm Hg, heart rate was 64 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Before anesthesia induction, he received 2 g of ceftriaxone intravenously, then he developed facial swelling, hypotension, and bradycardia, which progressed to pulseless electrical activity so cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and the patient was intubated. Although the cause of cardiac arrest was not clearly identified, it was thought to be an anaphylactic reaction to ceftriaxone.\nAfter return of spontaneous circulation, he was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further care. Aspirin and clopidogrel were resumed while rosuvastatin and metformin were held due to elevated liver enzymes and critical illness, respectively. Additionally, lansoprazole 30 mg once daily by nasogastric route and heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice daily were started for stress ulcer prophylaxis and for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, respectively. Blood counts on the day of admission were as follows: white blood cells 18.2 ×103/µL, hemoglobin 15.1 g/dL, platelets 289×103/µL. Other laboratory investigations were normal except INR 1.3, creatinine 1.36 mg/dL, potassium 3 mEq/L, bicarbonate 19 mEq/L, and albumin 3 g/dL. He was extubated at the evening of the second day of admission to the ICU. He developed acute kidney injury and required 3 sessions of hemodialysis over the first 5 days of hospitalization then his kidney function started to improve gradually over his ICU stay. On day 2 of hospitalization, he started to have severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. Computed tomography of chest and abdomen showed multiple rib fractures and diffuse bowel edema.\nOn day 5 of hospitalization, his platelets dropped gradually to 57×103/µL from 315×103/µL on admission (). Heparin was held and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies and fibrinogen level were requested to screen for HIT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), respectively. His medical record was reviewed, but no previous episodes of thrombocytopenia were identified. HIT antibody test was negative and fibrinogen level came to be 5.34 g/L (normal). Abdominal ultrasound was done which excluded splenomegaly.\nOn the next day (day 6 of admission), lansoprazole was suspected to be the cause of thrombocytopenia as it was the only newly introduced medication during admission and it was changed to ranitidine 150 mg once daily while heparin was reinitiated. His platelet count started to recover to normal gradually over the next 3 days. A full list of medications received during the first week of hospitalization is provided in . On the same day, the patient developed a urinary tract infection for which aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours was started. Two days later, his urine and blood cultures revealed extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli, so aztreonam was changed to ertapenem 1 g once daily for 14 days according to microbiological sensitivity results. On day 14 of admission, patient developed thrombocytosis (560 ×103/µL) which was thought to be reactive secondary to infection, and his platelet count continued to increase gradually over the next few days. His peripheral smear on that day showed mild anisopoikilocytosis, anisochromia, and toxic neutrophils.\nOn day 18 of admission, lansoprazole 30 mg daily was prescribed due to suspicion of upper GI bleeding suggested by drop in hemoglobin (rechallenge was not intended). Packed red blood cells were transfused and colonoscopy was done that showed severe colitis with no evidence of bleeding and several biopsies were taken. After lansoprazole reinitiation, his platelets dropped from 669×103/µL to 319×103/µL on day 5 of reinitiation. On day 20 of admission, he started to pass fresh blood with stools and received 2 units of packed red blood cells. After stopping lansoprazole, there was rebound increase in his platelets to 567×103/µL. On day 25, the histopathology result of colonic biopsies was released and was suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease so mesalamine 1 g 3 times daily was started, and the patient was transferred to the medical ward after 28 days in the ICU. Diarrhea and abdominal pain improved slightly after starting mesalamine, but they didn’t resolve completely. Repeat colonoscopy was planned after few days, but the patient requested discharge to travel back to his home country so he was discharged after 30 days of hospital stay. A thorough review of his medical record showed that the patient had received lansoprazole for 7 days 30 months before this admission, but platelets were not checked at that time. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent.

Although nephrectomy had been recommended at the previous hospital where she was first assessed, both the patient and her parents preferred to avoid surgery and wanted to explore further therapeutic options.\nOn admission, she was 155.1 cm tall and weighed 56.5 kg, with a blood pressure of 124/87 mm Hg and body temperature of 36.5°C. Abdominal distention was noted.

Moreover, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen as well as upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy performed seven months and one year before presentation, respectively were unremarkable. The patient had a medical history of hypertension for the last 5 years and depression since the age of 25.\nHer medication included olmesartan 40 mg and amlodipine 5 mg which were stable for the past 5 years, whereas there was a recent modification in her antidepressant medication (venlafaxine 75 mg was replaced by amitriptyline 50 mg, duloxetine 40 mg and clorazepate 15 mg) about 15 days before presentation. However, there was no change in her symptoms with this treatment modification. She denied using tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. Her father died at 67 from lung cancer and her sister at 47 from breast cancer; the rest family history was insignificant.\nAt presentation the temperature was 36°C, the blood pressure was 143/82 mmHg, the heart rate was 69 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation was 98%, while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her height was 1.60 m and her weight was 43 kg (body mass index 17 kg/m2). Bilateral pitting edema was detected on her lower extremities, while the remainder physical findings were unremarkable. The electrocardiogram was normal. Laboratory (Table ) and imaging studies were obtained.\nThe laboratory exams were significant for International Normalized Ratio (INR) prolongation, which was corrected with vitamin K administration, hypoalbuminemia without albuminuria and hypokalemia. Stool was negative for clostridium difficile, parasites or other enteropathogens. Chest radiograph and CT of brain, chest and abdomen were normal.

Upper endoscopy demonstrated an edematous, reddish duodenal mucosa with reduced mucosal folds. Duodenal biopsies demonstrated the increased presence of inflammatory cells and crypt cell proliferation with substantial villous atrophy. Lower endoscopy was insignificant. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA) and deaminated gliadin peptide antibodies (IgA and IgG) were negative, while a gluten-free diet was found to be ineffective.\nTaking into account the aforementioned examinations and by excluding almost with certainty celiac disease and neoplasia, we considered the possibility of olmesartan-induced enteropathy and discontinued olmesartan. Ten days after drug removal diarrhea resolved completely. Few months later, complete recovery of weight was observed along with normalization of laboratory tests (Table ). The patient denied a new upper endoscopy to confirm resolution of the lesions.

The blood pressure on admission was 150/87 mmHg with sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 129 beats per minute.\nInitial arterial blood gas (ABG) on admission () revealed Type 2 respiratory failure, while chest X-ray done showed bilateral pulmonary congestion.\nHe was initially started on non-invasive ventilation and intravenous frusemide and glyceryl trinitrate infusion. Despite initial clinical improvement, the patient became increasingly restless with worsening hypoxaemia and decision was made for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, he suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest peri-intubation with a low-flow time of 20 min before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\nHe was started on our institution’s protocolized post-cardiac arrest care bundle () which included continuous rSO2 monitoring and TTM with mild induced hypothermia at 33°C. An oesophageal probe was inserted for core body temperature monitoring. Initial ABG post-ROSC revealed a Type 2 respiratory failure with pH 7.14, pCO2 54, pO2 110, HCO3 18, and SaO2 97%. Patient was sedated and paralyzed and ventilator settings were optimized to correct the respiratory acidosis. Patient was ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg predicted body weight and at a ventilator rate of 28 breaths per minute. Initial cerebral oximetry revealed an rSO2 66% (left) and 67% (right).\nPost-resuscitation SpO2 was maintained above 94% and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was constantly above 80 mmHg without the need for inotropes or vasopressors. However, it was subsequently noted that the cerebral rSO2 had decreased to 33% (left) and 35% (right) and a repeat ABG showed resolution of the respiratory acidosis with pH 7.3, pCO2 33, pO2 138, HCO3 16, and SaO2 99%.\nVentilator settings were immediately adjusted and the minute ventilation reduced by lowering the ventilator rate to aim for mild therapeutic hypercapnia with a target pCO2 of 50–55 mmHg. PEEP was reduced from 12 cmH2O to avoid an excessively high intrathoracic pressure which may impede cerebral venous drainage. Patient was also started on dobutamine infusion to improve the global and cerebral perfusion as the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of 62% reflected a systemic oxygen delivery/consumption mismatch, while a Pcv-aCO2 gap of 14 mmHg suggested a low-flow state.

    "problem": "<Context> In February 2011, a retroperitoneal tumor was suspected by a health check in a 57-year-old Japanese woman and subsequent examination led to the suspicion of a right pheochromocytoma. As the patient was a Jehovah's Witness, she wished to undergo bloodless surgery and consulted our hospital in June 2011 after being refused surgery by several hospitals.\nThe characteristics of the patient recorded at the time of hospital admission were as follows: height: 154 cm, weight: 56 kg, blood pressure: 115/65 mm Hg and heart rate: 78 bpm and regular. The tumor was palpable in the right hypochondrium. There were no physical signs of Cushing's syndrome such as moon facies or buffalo hump. There were no abnormal findings in the peripheral blood and biochemical tests. Endocrine tests revealed high levels of urinary normetanephrine (1.60 mg/day). There were no abnormal findings in any other items, including blood adrenaline, cardiac function, and pulmonary function.\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a retroperitoneal tumor (size: 12 cm) touching the upper pole of the right kidney with an uneven contrast-enhanced effect inside the tumor. The tumor had ill-defined borders with the surrounding liver, right kidney, inferior vena cava, right renal artery and vein, and left renal vein, which indicated adhesion (fig. ). There was no clear lymph node metastasis or distal metastasis on imaging. The tumor had a low signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Marked accumulation was found on 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.\nThe above findings were suggestive of a right adrenal pheochromocytoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT findings revealed that tumorectomy required a right renal combined resection, sectioning of the right renal artery and vein, left renal vein, and inferior vena cava, and detachment of the tumor from the lower hepatic surface. Despite explaining the importance of blood to the patient once again as an outpatient, she did not give consent. However, we were able to gain her consent for the use of albumin preparations, intraoperative diluted autotransfusions, intraoperative recovery-type autotransfusions, the use of a heart-lung machine, and hemodialysis. A preoperation conference was held with the four hospital departments including anesthesiology, gastrointestinal surgery (because of the detachment of the tumor from the liver), and cardiovascular surgery (extracorporeal circulation is required when sectioning the inferior vena cava). The type of surgical procedure was confirmed, and the risks involved were sufficiently discussed. Then, the patient and her friends were provided the details of the surgery. The patient also acknowledged the risk of bleeding to death because of bloodless surgery, loss of renal function because of the removal of the right kidney and left renal vein, the possibility of hemodialysis, the risk of partial liver removal, and eventual exploratory laparotomy. After the patient understood all risks and consented, a written consent and waiver of liability for blood transfusion refusal were signed. In accordance with the surgical policy, an erythropoietin preparation, iron, and doxazosin mesylate were administered prior to surgery.\nAfter the diagnosis of right pheochromocytoma, open surgery was conducted with an abdominal midline incision in August 2011. During operation, the tumor was found adhered to the peritoneum, diaphragm, lower hepatic surface, inferior vena cava, and right renal vein. It engulfed the right renal artery and vein.\nFirst, the adhesion site of the tumor was detached from the lower hepatic surface. Partial hepatic resection was not necessary. Then, the anterior surface of the tumor was detached from the left renal vein, and the left renal vein was secured. Next, the right renal artery was tied, and blood flow to the right kidney was blocked. A clamp test was performed on the inferior vena cava and left renal vein, and as there were no changes in blood pressure, the bypass was considered adequate. Next, the tumor was very carefully detached from the inferior vena cava, which was tied to protect the right renal vein as tumor detachment progressed. Lastly, the tumor vessels flowing into the inferior vena cava were tied, and both the right kidney and tumor were removed. The inferior vena cava and left renal vein were preserved. The operative times were 8 h and 18 min and blood loss was 1,770 ml.\nThe resected specimen (size: 10.5 × 11.9 cm) was macroscopically brown in appearance with multiple cysts. There was no continuity of the tumor in the normal adrenal gland, and it was diagnosed as paraganglioma (fig. ).\nOn histological findings, the tumor consisted of a hyperplasia of cells with basophilic cytoplasm and was arranged in an alveolar pattern around fibrous blood vessels (fig. ). Histologically, there was no clear continuity of the tumor in the adrenal gland tissue, and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma was diagnosed. No invasion into the right adrenal gland or right kidney was observed.\nFollowing surgery, the patient progressed without any major changes in blood pressure or other complications and the high urinary normetanephrine level returned to normal. After discharge, the patient continues to have follow-ups at her home hospital. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He had been treated 2 months earlier for a Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, when he presented with similar symptoms and had a troponin rise from 28 to 81 and a computerised tomographic coronary angiogram showed moderate to severe right coronary artery and mild left anterior descending artery disease. Other symptoms on this occasion included a productive cough and a significant unintentional weight loss over the past 6 months. He did not have any other previous medical problems, and he did not have any occupational exposures of note. His height was 165cm with a weight of 74 kg. He was afebrile on admission with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/77 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 93% on air with a respiratory rate of 23. He had bilateral temporal muscle wasting but no clubbing, palpable lymphadenopathy or peripheral oedema. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral coarse crackles up to mid-zones. His blood work showed a white blood cell count of 4.0 × 103/μl, haemoglobin 11.3 gm/dl, MCV 80fl, alkaline phosphatase of 306 U/L with normal calcium, renal and liver function tests. A chest X-ray revealed airspace opacities bilaterally in the mid and lower zones and diffuse sclerotic changes in the visualised bones. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli and general microbiology on smear and cultures.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest showed diffuse reticulonodular and ground-glass opacities involving both lung fields associated with interlobular septal thickening but no apparent EM [a,b]. The lung changes suggested a chronic pneumonitis type picture, nevertheless, the possibility of metastatic nodules/disease could not be excluded. Diagnostic bronchoscopy showed multiple tiny endotracheal and bronchial nodules in the anterior wall of the distal trachea and major bronchi [, a and b]. Histology of the endobronchial nodules on biopsies showed bronchial mucosa heavily infiltrated by a tumour characterized by cords, vague nests and vague acini consisting of small-sized tumour cells, some having hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli [, a].\nImmunohistochemistry was strongly positive for CK AE1/AE3 and PSA confirming metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma [b]. CT of abdomen and pelvis revealed a diffusely heterogeneous and enlarged prostate with postero-lateral bladder wall thickening and prominence of lymph nodes within the abdomen and pelvis. Coupled with this were extensive sclerotic bony lesions. His total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was more than 5000 ng/ml. A bone scan showed multiple deposits involving the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, clavicles, humeri, femora, skull and the bony pelvis. Subsequently, he was started on hormonal treatment by the Uro-oncology team with his last PSA dropping to 62 ng/ml. He was offered chemotherapy as well with Docetaxel which he declined. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> Mild proteinuria had been incidentally detected in a 22-year-old woman during a regular health check-up 2 years prior to presentation. She visited a local clinic for a follow-up check. She took medication to treat hyperlipidemia for 1 year and did not take any other drugs including diuretics or laxatives. She was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of persistent mild proteinuria.\nThe prenatal course was unremarkable. On physical examination, her height was 153 cm, her body weight was 49 kg and her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg. No edema was found, and normal muscle strength and reflexes were noted. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The laboratory examination revealed blood urea nitrogen of 10.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 2.59 mmol/L, chloride of 94.7 mmol/L, magnesium of 2.05 mEq/L, and bicarbonate of 31.2 mEq/L. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, trace protein, pH 8.0, and no red blood cells. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 0.95 g/g creatinine. Abdominal sonography revealed normal-sized kidneys, without nephrocalcinosis or stones. Plasma renin activity was elevated at 27.98 ng/mL/hr (normal range, 0.50 to 1.90 ng/mL/hr in a supine position), but serum aldosterone was 13.2 pg/mL within normal limits (normal range, 1 to 16 pg/mL in a supine position). The urine prostaglandin E2 level was elevated at 2,815 ng/day (normal range, 400 to 620 ng/day). These findings suggested BS or pseudo-BS/GS caused by vomiting or diuretics.\nLight microscopy of renal biopsy demonstrated 14 glomeruli, two of which were globally sclerotic. Most glomeruli appeared moderately increased in size and cellularity due to prominence of the mesangium and JGA. Five glomeruli showed marked enlargement with hyperplasia () and hypergranulosis of the JGA (). The mesangium was diffusely expanded due to mild to moderate increase in cells and matrix (). There was moderate tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with infiltration of lymphocytes. The interlobular arteries and arterioles displayed mild to moderate intimal fibrous thickening and medial sclerosis. Immunofluorescence revealed weak positive (1+) staining for IgG, IgA, and fibrinogen and trace (+/–) of staining for C3 and lambda in the mesangium (). Electron microscopy revealed mild increase in the mesangial cells and matrix with rare small mesangial electron-dense deposits and hyperplastic juxtaglomerular cells with increased electron dense renin and progranules ().\nGenetic analysis revealed a homozygous deletion of exon 1–14 and heterozygous deletion of exon 15–19 in the CLCNKB gene (). Her father had heterozygous deletion of exon 1–14 (), and her mother had heterozygous deletion of all examined exons of the CLCNKB gene ().

    "problem": "<Context> A 70-year-old male patient presented himself to the emergency department due to having had productive cough for one week. He has a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage III chronic kidney disease, hypertension, old pulmonary tuberculosis, and poliomyelitis. He also received a mechanical valve replacement for severe tricuspid regurgitation and has been taking warfarin for 10 years. He was admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.\nOn the second day after admission, the patient developed massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a remarkable decrease of hemoglobin from 11.1 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. He had a profound coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT) of 43.4 s, international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.07, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 63.2 s. The platelet count was 252,000/μL. Warfarin was discontinued. He received blood component therapy and Vitamin K1 to correct anemia and coagulopathy. He also received intravenous esomeprazole. The panendoscopic examination showed an ulcer on the duodenal bulb with an active oozing vessel on the ulcer crater (Fig. -). Hemostasis was performed with epinephrine injection and hemoclipping (Fig. -).\nThe patient had abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension one day after the endoscopic procedure. Hemoglobin was further dropped to 5.8 g/dL, and coagulopathy was worsened with PT of 60.4 s, INR of 5.69, and aPTT of 60.1 s despite of aggressive component therapy. Total serum bilirubin level was rapidly elevated from 1.68 mg/dL to 6.00 mg/dL. Acute pancreatitis was also suspected with a lipase level of 3743 IU/L. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a 14.4 cm × 7 cm intramural hematoma at the second portion of duodenum (Fig. -). The stomach was distended which indicated gastric outlet obstruction. He also had air retention in the portal vein and wall of esophagus, stomach and bulb (Fig. - to ).\nThe patient developed respiratory failure and shock, and he received support with mechanical ventilation. His bleeding tendency was corrected by vitamin K1 and blood component therapy. Hemodynamic instability was promptly resolved within two days. Abdominal ultrasonography taken six days later showed the finding of complete resolution of the duodenal hematoma, and was confirmed with endoscopy two weeks later (Fig. ). But, his renal function was progressively worsened, and the patient and his family declined hemodialysis therapy. The patient died of renal failure on the 40th day after admission.\nDepending on the involved site of gastrointestinal tract, clinical presentation of PI is usually nonspecific, varying from chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, to gastrointestinal bleeding, or even no symptom [, , ].\nGastric pneumatosis has been described in various circumstances, including patients who have hemorrhagic radiation gastritis after Argon plasma coagulation [], gastric ulcer [], corrosive injury of stomach, status post endoscopy, gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction, nasogastric tube placement [], hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction, obstructive pulmonary disease with bleb rupture [], and high-dose dexamethasone therapy []. It can be divided into two categories: first, gastric emphysema, implying benign condition and usually being managed by conservative treatment; and second, emphysematous gastritis, suggesting emergent condition, and surgical intervention being critical for life-saving. Mclaughlin et al. have proposed to use the term gangrenous PI/nongangrenous PI instead of emphysematous gastritis/gastric emphysema, to avoid misleading [].\nIDH is also a rare condition that mostly occurs after a blunt abdominal trauma because that the duodenum has rich submucosal vascular supply and is fixed in retroperitoneum []. IDH has also been reported as clinical finding associated with anticoagulant therapy, blood dyscrasia, pancreatic disease, collagen vascular disease [], and diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopy [] such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and biliary stone retrieval []. It tends to occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, coagulopathy and hemodialysis especially []. IDH is usually confined from the first portion to the second portion of the duodenum due to the barrier of pylorus and ligament of Treitz. Typical symptoms of IDH include epigastric pain, vomiting, and hematochezia. Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent comorbidity in those patients []. Thandassery et al. reported a rare case in a patient who developed intramural duodenal hematoma after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stone extraction with subsequent of acute pancreatitis, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction after ERCP []. Our patient also had the triad of above symptoms. We also observed rapid decline of hemoglobin level in our patient and this observation has been described in other case reports [, ]. We suggest that the patients should be suspected to have IHD if they have the tetrad of acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin after an endoscopic examination.\nIn uncomplicated cases, IDH usually resolves spontaneously with conservative treatment in 1–3 weeks []. Sadio et al. have reported a case in a patient with intramural gastric hematoma after endoscopic injection therapy, and have found that patient’s hematoma disappear six days later []. In our patient, the IDH was spontaneously resolved under abdominal sonography six days after the endoscopy.\nTo our best knowledge, less than 10 cases of patients with esophageal pneumatosis have been reported [, ], and no esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis has been reported. The mechanism of PI has been experimentally proved that dissection of the gas from intraluminal to the intramural compartment is due to increased intra-abdominal pressure combined with mucosal defect []. We hypothesize that the findings of our patient are derived from the similar mechanism. The air was inflated from the defect of the needle injection site after endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, and warfarin-associated coagulopathy precipitated the formation of IDH, which further dissected the duodenal wall, leading to inflated air entering into the duodenal, gastric and esophageal wall. The inflated air finally entered the portal vein through the portal circulation system.\nTraditionally, once the pneumoporta is recognized along with PI, surgical intervention is preferred due to the concern of having ischemic bowel. But, PI is a radiological finding with wide spectrum of clinical severity and outcome. Surgical or conservative treatment should be considered according to the underlying etiology []. In this patient, esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis and intramural duodenal hematoma were resolved spontaneously six days later. Therefore, we suggest that conservative treatment and close clinical assessment should be considered as an initial management for patients who complicate with IDH and PI after an endoscopic procedure. But, surgery is needed for those patients if the diseases progress or complications persist. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

WBC count at admission was 8400 with no shift, and hemoglobin and hematocrit were 8.8 and 25.8, respectively. Chest X-ray showed no acute pulmonary pathology. At the time of admission, the differential diagnoses were (1) drug-induced interstitial nephritis, (2) postinfectious glomerulonephritis, (3) acute tubular necrosis, and (4) pulmonary-renal syndrome including Goodpasture's syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, or Wegener's granulomatosis.\nCephalexin was stopped and she was started on IV hydration but responded poorly and remained oliguric. Additional laboratory studies revealed negative urine eosinophils, normal C3 and C4 levels, and negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, and ASO titers. ANCA at admission was positive at ≥1 : 20 with a perinuclear pattern, confirmed as MPO (myelo-peroxidase) ANCA on ELISA. Anti-GBM IgG antibody was positive with titer 234 au/mL (0–19 au/mL).

Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia ().\nShe was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L.\nFurther investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%.\nHer gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis.\nAnti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.\nShe was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly. Laboratory tests on 2-week follow up showed serum urea of 15 mg/ dl; creatinine, 0.4 mg/dl; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 102 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 30 mEq/L; calcium, 8.8 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.8 mg/dl; albumin, 3.1 g/dl; and magnesium, 1.9 mg/dl.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 127.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 127.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 1.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 17.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.8 (in g/dL)) = 22.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 22.5 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 63-year-old African American man was transferred to the neurological intensive care unit from a nearby hospital after presenting with an acute history of multiple falls. Earlier that day, he had fallen once while walking to the bathroom from his bed and had fallen again shortly thereafter while walking through his living room. The patient's family decided at that time to bring him to the nearby hospital for treatment. At that hospital, no focal findings were discovered, but his blood pressure was noted to be elevated at 272/139 mm Hg. At that point, the original hospital placed the patient on a nicardipine drip to treat his hypertension and transferred the patient to our medical center, where he arrived late that night.\nThe patient presented to the medical center complaining of dizziness and agonizing headache. He was also noted to be somnolent and experiencing some dysarthria. The family at the bedside reported that the patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hyperlipidemia. It was also determined that the patient was a former chronic smoker, did not consume alcohol, and used marijuana occasionally. Physical exam showed some lethargy, dysarthria, right gaze paresis and nystagmus, vertical gaze weakness, and dysmetria on the right side more so than on the left. There was no hemiparesis, and visual fields were normal to confrontation. The patient had 5/5 strength, intact sensation, and 2+ reflexes of the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. It was determined that the patient had 4 points on both the NIH Stroke Scale and the Modified Rankin Scale for Neurologic Disability at admission. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck revealed decreased attenuation throughout most of the cerebellar hemispheres suggestive of ischemic injury (Fig ), diminished caliber of the fourth ventricle indicating increased pressure, and an old watershed infarct on the right side between the territories of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The area of the brain that is perfused by the PCA was surprisingly completely spared from infarct. CT angiography of the head revealed diffuse abnormally decreased attenuation of the cerebellar hemispheres with sparing of the vermis, suggesting infarction of both SCAs, and a narrow irregular left vertebral artery with a risk for subtotal thrombosis. There was no evidence of stenosis or a blood clot in the basilar artery or either SCA at the time of the CT angiography. Furthermore, it was discovered that the patient had a partial fetal-type PCA (fPCA) originating from the internal carotid artery (ICA) on the right side as seen in Figure .\nDue to the fact that the patient was well out of the window for thrombolytic therapy, he was initially treated with aspirin. Neurosurgery was consulted because of the patient's declining mental status caused by a mass effect in the posterior fossa. They elected to immediately take the patient in for a decompressive craniotomy. During the procedure, the dura overlying the cerebellum was noted to be very taut and to have a blue discoloration. Upon incision of the dura, there was spontaneous protrusion of necrotic brain matter. Much of the left and right cerebellum hemispheres were necrotic, but the vermis appeared to be spared from damage. The necrotic tissue was cleared, and the patient's cranium was closed.\nOver the next 24 h after the operation, the patient was extubated and remained lethargic but arousable. He responded to verbal commands, and facial movements were symmetrical. His right lateral gaze weakness persisted, and movement was diminished somewhat in the left extremities. Additionally, CT of the head showed new hydrocephalus, and electrocardiogram monitoring revealed intermittent atrial fibrillation throughout the day. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed after discovery of the patient's arrhythmia, and it showed an ejection fraction of 55–60% as well as no evidence of residual thrombus. An amiodarone drip was administered in an effort to normalize the patient's heart rhythm. Anticoagulation with warfarin was not prescribed for another 3 weeks, as the patient experienced some bleeding in the posterior fossa after surgery. Neurosurgery placed an external ventricular drain to help decrease the intracranial pressure.\nPrior to the discovery of this patient's atrial fibrillation, the intensive care team had proposed that the cause of the stroke might have been an embolism from the diseased left vertebral artery. However, knowing that this patient was experiencing intermittent atrial fibrillation led the team to assess that the cause was more likely an embolism from the left atrium. Because it is unlikely that 2 separate emboli occluded both SCAs simultaneously, it was postulated that this was a single top of the basilar artery embolism that was large enough to occlude both SCAs. Such an occlusion should have led to ischemic injury of the regions of the brain perfused by the PCAs. Given this, the team determined that the bilateral PCA sparing may have been due to collateral perfusion supplied by the fetal origin of the PCA on the right side.\nThe patient remained lethargic over the next 24 h despite the placement of the external ventricular drain. The next morning, however, the patient woke up with markedly improved symptomatology. He was oriented to person and place, followed commands appropriately, and had 5/5 strength in all extremities along with intact sensation. Dysarthria and dysmetria of both upper extremities were noted, but overall the patient made a remarkable recovery from his condition the day before. The team continued to monitor and treat the patient over the next 3 weeks, and the patient was discharged for rehabilitation. At discharge, it was determined that the patient once again had 4 points on both the NIH Stroke Scale and the Modified Rankin Scale for Neurologic Disability. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 63 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 1 + 2 = 3. Because vascular disease history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 4.",

He was arousable on scene and was transported by the Emergency Medical Services to a local Emergency Department, where he remained awake and alert. He admitted to huffing the Dust-Off, as well as a history of recurrent and heavy hydrocarbon huffing. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and revealed sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc of 472 milliseconds (). The patient was transferred to a regional burn unit for frostbite on his hand due to refrigerant exposure.\nWhile in the burn unit, the patient had a generalized seizure and went into cardiac arrest. Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol was initiated. The patient was found to be in a torsades de pointes rhythm () and was given magnesium. He was intubated, resuscitated, and sent to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was placed on fentanyl and midazolam drips and continuously monitored. Episodes of hypotension and tachycardia were noted, as well as right bundle branch block on repeat ECG. He was started on multiple vasopressors and given amiodarone for dysrhythmias. Hypocalcemia (5.6 mg/dL) was treated with calcium gluconate boluses and resolved.\nPertinent medical history included multiple psychiatric admissions and tobacco and prior alcohol abuse. The patient was homeless and unemployed. Possible outpatient medications included multiple antidepressants and sedatives, but compliance was unknown.\nAt the time of toxicology consultation approximately 24 hours after presentation, physical exam revealed a young white male, intubated, arousable but easily agitated. Vital signs included a heart rate of 106, blood pressure of 110/67, respiratory rate of 14 per minute, and 100% oxygen saturation on the ventilator. Maximum temperature was noted to be 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit, with a temperature of 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit at consultation. His pupils were 3 mm and reactive to light. He was tachycardic with a regular rhythm. The remainder of the exam was benign with no appreciable neurological deficits, rigidity, or clonus.\nInitial chemistry panel revealed creatinine of 1.55 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, magnesium of 3.0 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 19.

    "Lower Limit": "0.831",
    "Upper Limit": "0.919",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 103.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 103.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 103.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 103.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 103.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 19.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.0 - 12 = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 7.0 mEq/L / 8.0 mEq/L = 0.875. The patient's delta ratio is 0.875.",

Her hemoglobin A1C was 13.7%. Urinalysis was positive for glucose and ketones.\nIt was obvious from the labs that the patient had diabetic ketoacidosis (high blood glucose, low bicarbonate, and positive ketones) with anion gap of 21. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Intravenous normal saline fluid bolus was given with maintenance intravenous fluid after that. She was kept on nothing per mouth and started on insulin drip with hourly blood glucose check and every four hours serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphorus) check.\nCT scan of the abdomen showed mild distension of the proximal small bowel and tiny amount of free fluids with wall thickening of distended small bowel loops. She was started on ampicillin/sulbactam after getting blood cultures. Stool sample was sent for analysis and the results were negative leukocytes and negative clostridium difficile toxin. Therefore, we decided to stop the antibiotics at this point and treat her as viral gastroenteritis. Later on, the patient's symptoms have improved and her anion gap closed, so we started her on liquid diet (which she was able to tolerate). She was switched to subcutaneous insulin injections (as insulin glargine at bedtime and sliding scale insulin before each meal) and transferred to medical floor. Her blood cultures did not grow any bacteria, and stool culture was negative. Insulin autoantibodies were negative, c-peptide was lower than normal (0.34 ng/mL), and her glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies were highly positive (>30 U/mL).\nAfter having diabetic education including a dietitian consult in the hospital, the patient was discharged home on subcutaneous insulin treatment with a diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adult. The patient was encouraged to do regular exercise.\nThe patient was concerned about her new diagnosis and its possible complications which required counseling about the importance of taking care of her diabetes and how this would help prevent future complications.\nThe patient was very compliant with the discharge plan and checked her blood sugar before each meal and at bedtime.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 132.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 5.71 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 5.71 mmol. To convert 5.71 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 5.71 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.006 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.006 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.168 g bun. To convert 0.168 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.168 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 168.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 168.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 16.8 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 5.71 mmol bun/L converts to 16.8 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 18.76 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 18.76 mmol. To convert 18.76 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 18.76 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.019 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.019 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.423 g glucose. To convert 3.423 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.423 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3423.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3423.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 342.3 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 18.76 mmol glucose/L converts to 342.3 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 132.0 + (16.8 / 2.8) + (16.8 / 18) = 289.017 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 289.017 mmol/L.

She was diagnosed with DS at 9 months of age. She was able to run, dance, and sing, and her daily activities were mostly independent. From the age of 40 years, her cognitive function gradually declined, resulting in progressive loss of autonomy. At the age of 50 years, she was admitted to our hospital. At the time, although she could not stand and walk, she spoke cheerfully and participated in play activities every day. While in our department, on general physical examination, her height and weight were 146 cm and 47 kg, respectively. Blood pressure was 118/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 117 beats/min, temperature was 36.9°C, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. A general examination revealed morphological features of DS including a small chin, slanted eyes, a flat nasal bridge, a single crease of the palm, and a protruding tongue. On neurological examination, she was drowsy and exhibited mutism. She did not follow any orders, and voluntarily moved her eyes, mouth, head, and extremities. All the while, myoclonic jerks appeared continuously once every 3–5 s in her upper body. Her lower limbs showed mild atrophy. No fasciculation or myokymia was found anywhere. Her muscle tone was slightly high with paratonia of the bilateral upper limbs. She could not walk and stand even with assistance, and she needed a trunk belt to sustain a sitting position in the wheelchair. Deep tendon reflexes, including the biceps, triceps, patellar tendon, and Achilles tendon reflexes, showed hyperreflexia in both upper and lower limbs. Babinski signs were negative on both feet. Laboratory testing revealed sodium, 143 mmol/L; potassium, 3.3 mmol/L; chloride, 106 mmol/L; glucose, 120 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.48 mg/dL; calcium, 8.0 mg/dL; serum albumin, 3.1 g/dL; and ammonia, 18 μg/dL. Thyroid function and thiamine and vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits. Video-EEG recordings showed generalized continuous slowing, generalized intermittent rhythmic sharp waves, and generalized polyspike-wave complexes consistent with myoclonic jerks on the monitor (Fig. ). Intermittent photo-stimulation within 9–24 Hz induced polyspike-wave complexes and myoclonic jerks (Fig. ). Brain MRI showed severe cortical atrophy and ventricle enlargement (Fig. ). On diffusion-weighted image, no high-intensity lesion was found (Fig. ). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed a significant hypoperfusion around the Sylvian fissure, parietal region, and cingulate gyrus (Fig. ). Chromosome analysis detected a female karyotype denoted by 46, XX, idic(21)(q22.3) with a normal chromosome 21 and an isodicentric chromosome 21, which had 2 copies of the long arm of chromosome 21 with inverted fusion at the q22.3 band (Fig. ). She was started on perampanel at 2 mg/day. A week later, blood concentration of perampanel was 176 ng/mL. Her myoclonus completely resolved, and she returned to her baseline mentation.

The parents reported that she began to gain weight rapidly at 1.5 years of age. There was no consanguinity between the parents. The patient had two healthy siblings (of ages 11 years and 9 months). Body weight was 61 kg (±3.9 SD) and height was 130 cm (±1.8 SD) with a body mass index (BMI) of 36 kg/m2 (±3.3 SD). She had a plethoric facial appearance, axillary acanthosis nigricans, pale/blue fingers and toes and stage 2 thelarche, bilaterally. The patient was admitted to hospital for further evaluation. During follow-up, it was observed that she had episodes of excessive sweating and a body temperature as low as 35.4 °C. Blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg (95 percentile: 120/80 mm/Hg). Laboratory evaluation showed the following results: sodium (Na), 156 mmol/L [normal range (NR): 135-145 mmol/L]; aspartate transaminase, 87 U/L (NR: 8-45 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 57 U/L (NR: 7-55 U/L); urine density, 1024. The remaining liver function tests, serum electrolytes, lipids kidney function tests and complete blood count were normal. The patient had no polydipsia; thus, hypernatremia was considered to be due to insufficient intake. Oral fluid replacement was given and the hypernatremia was corrected (Na: 141 mmol/L). Impaired glucose tolerance (141 mg/dL at two hours) was detected in the oral glucose tolerance test performed due to morbid obesity and acanthosis nigricans; and the patient was started on metformin. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, due to the elevated transaminase levels, which revealed grade 3 hepatic steatosis.\nIn terms of hormonal problems that may present in the patient’s follow-up hormonal evaluation revealed the following results: free T4, 0.7 ng/mL (NR: 0.98-1.6 ng/mL; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 4.8 µIU/mL (NR: 0.5-4.3 µIU/mL); adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 24 pg/mL (NR: 10-60 pg/mL); cortisol, 1.5 µg/mL (NR: 3-21 µg/mL); LH, 1.3 mIU/mL (prepubertal NR: <0.3 mIU/mL); estradiol, 12.9 pg/mL (prepubertal NR: <12 pg/mL); prolactin (PRL), 33 ng/mL (NR: 4.7-23.3 ng/mL). Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was <25 ng/mL and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) 1870 ng/mL. Bone age was advanced at 10 years. Peak cortisol response to low dose ACTH stimulation test was low (9.9 µg/mL).\nA diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency, central hypothyroidism and central precocious puberty was made and treatment was initiated with hydrocortisone, thyroxine and leuprolide acetate. No further evaluation or treatment was considered for GH deficiency, due to the patient’s normal height. However, a predisposition to neural crest tumor was considered despite the low IGF-1 and IGFBP3 levels of the patient. Brain and pituitary magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were found to be normal. The IQ score was 65. The pale appearance of the fingers was considered to be due to Raynaud’s phenomenon (). Alterations in body temperature and Raynaud’s phenomenon were attributed to autonomic dysfunction.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 156.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 156.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 156.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 156.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 156.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 156.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 141.0 mg/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 156.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (141.0 - 100) = 156.984 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 156.984 mEq/L.",

Her previous medical history included development of diffuse erythematous rash following a course of minocycline prescribed for acne three months prior to ED presentation. The minocycline was discontinued, and she was treated with 30 milligrams (mg) daily oral prednisone with improvement of the rash. Initial vitals included blood pressure of 81/68 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), heart rate of 121 beats per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. She was afebrile (36.7ºC oral temperature) and had pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 100% on room air. Physical exam was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right bundle branch block and normal ST-T segments, but no previous ECG was available.\nWhile in the ED the patient had an episode of syncope during peripheral venous catheter placement, and intravenous (IV) fluids were administered due to concern of vasovagal event. She was also administered 5 mg IV dexamethasone due to possibility of adrenal suppression from steroid use. Her systolic pressure improved. However, the patient complained of worsening chest pain and then became unresponsive with pulseless electrical activity arrest (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support were initiated. She received two doses of 1 mg IV epinephrine with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in normal sinus rhythm of 70 bpm and blood pressure of 72/48 mmHg. Due to persistent hypotension, norepinephrine infusion was administered with improvement of blood pressure to 88/56 mmHg. She was intubated for airway protection.\nDue to concern for massive pulmonary embolus, computed tomography chest angiography was performed but was unremarkable. Point-of-care echocardiogram demonstrated no right heart strain and grossly reduced heart function. Telemetry demonstrated QRS widening and increasing bradycardia to 41 bpm. The patient then developed a second PEA arrest with ROSC after CPR and one dose of 1 mg IV epinephrine. She remained hypotensive with blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion. Initial troponin-T measured was 8.56 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.0–0.02 ng/mL) and complete blood count with differential showed leukocytosis of 17.5 × 103 cells/mL (reference range 4.0–10.0 × 103 cells/mL) and eosinophilia of 1.6 × 103 cells/mL r (reference range 0.0–0.4 × 103 cells/mL). The cardiology service was consulted and a formal echocardiogram demonstrated a severely reduced ejection fraction of 15% (normal range 55–70%).\nThe dermatology service was also consulted at bedside in the ED; concern for ANEM in setting of DRESS given the rapidity of onset of her cardiac dysfunction was discussed. Also, the differential diagnoses included coronary vasculitis, viral myocarditis, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and sepsis. (She was administered 4.5 g piperacillin/tazobactam and 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) vancomycin, and 500 mg azithromycin IV.)\nWhile in the ED the patient developed further hypotension with blood pressure of 61/40 mmHg despite multiple vasopressors (IV vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions) and had severe acidemia and hypoxemia despite high ventilator support. Ventilator settings were tidal volume of 360mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 centimeters of water (cmH2O), and fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.06, carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) of 78 mmHg (reference range 33–43 mmHg), low arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 61 mmHg (reference range 80–100 mmHg), and normal bicarbonate. Basal metabolic panel was within normal limits. Due to continued decline, she received cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) within the ED. ECMO cannulation occurred within three hours of initial cardiac arrest. Once placed on ECMO she had significant improvement in her acidosis and hypoxemia on repeat ABG (pH 7.39, pCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2 135 mmHg) and was rapidly weaned from her vasopressors.\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. Due to concern of DRESS-induced myocarditis, dexamethasone with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was administered intravenously. On hospital day (HD) eight, cardiac biopsy demonstrated diffuse active myocarditis with coagulative myocyte necrosis and mixed infiltrate including eosinophils consistent with DRESS myocarditis. She was decannulated from ECMO on HD 16. She was eventually discharged after 20 days in the ICU and 62 total days in the hospital with a life vest and continued cardiac follow-up.

A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombi and deep venous thrombus in the lower limb (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a right ventricular thrombus (Fig. ). She was referred to our hospital at 28 weeks of gestation after insertion of IVC filter and heparin administration. Fetal development was normal. Due to the mobility of right ventricular thrombus and the risk of cardiac arrest, an emergency thrombectomy was planned. An intracardiac echography probe (AcuNav™; Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) was inserted via the right femoral vein to monitor the umbilical artery pulse wave via Doppler, in addition to transabdominal fetal monitoring. After induction of anesthesia, the patient’s blood pressure was undetectable; hence, emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed via median sternotomy, followed by cardiac resuscitation. While switching to extracorporeal circulation approximately 10 min after the hemodynamic collapse, the fetal heart rate decreased to approximately 80 beats per minute. Immediately after establishing extracorporeal circulation, the fetal heart rate recovered rapidly and remained stable throughout the procedure, while the CPB average perfusion pressure was maintained above 70 mmHg. Thrombectomy and tricuspid valve plication were performed under cardiac arrest (Fig. ). Catecholamines and nitric oxide were administered at a concentration of 20 ppm to treat hypotension and pulmonary hypertension, respectively, during withdrawal from CPB. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit without chest closure. Total time for surgery, anesthesia, cardiopulmonary, and aortic cross clamp was 345, 483, 208, and 147 min, respectively. The total volume of hemorrhage, transfusion, infusion, urine, and water balance was 1470, 3600, 2150, 1520, and +657 ml, respectively. Chest closure was performed on postoperative day 3 and extubation on postoperative day 6. Heparin administration was resumed after confirming postoperative hemostasis. At 32 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess the fetal brain function; no remarkable changes were observed. The patient was discharged with subcutaneous injection of heparin calcium, due to persistent lower limb thrombus.\nShe was readmitted at 38 weeks of gestation. Labor was induced at 40 weeks using oxytocin, after discontinuation of heparin. Epidural anesthesia was administered to protect the thoracic wound site and reduce the cardiac load. An epidural catheter was placed between the L3-L4 vertebrae, after confirming the recovery of hemostatic function by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time. Continuous epidural ropivacaine 0.1% with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl was administered through patient controlled epidural analgesia. Analgesia was adequate throughout labor, with no hemodynamic changes. A healthy male infant weighing 3446 g (+1.07 SD) was delivered by vacuum extraction with an Apgar score of 8/8. Total delivery time was 3 h and 37 min, with total blood loss of 928 ml.

The DMSA scan revealed a split renal function of 51.8% on the right and 48.2% on the left kidney. The MAG3 diuretics renogram showed a decrease in both the flow and function of both kidneys. Abdominal MRI showed large, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, fusiform dilatation of the common bile duct, and small, round, and tubular dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts (). Needle biopsy of the liver revealed fibrotic changes, a finding that suggested congenital hepatic fibrosis (). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of Caroli's syndrome with ARPKD was made.

The routine biochemical tests revealed hyponatremia (126,6 mmol/L, normal: 135-145), hypokalemia (2.59 mmol/L, normal: 3.5-5.5), low ionized calcium (3.18 mg/dL, normal: 4.2-5.4), magnesium (1.37 mg/dL, normal: 1.9-2.7) and phosphate concentrations (1.2 mg/dL, normal: 2.6-4.5), severe hypoproteinemia (4.78 g/dL, normal: 6.4-8.3), hypoalbuminemia (1.2 g/dL, normal: 3.5-5.5), elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (298 U/L, normal: 38-155) and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (127 U/L, normal: 7-32). The other biochemical results were within normal limits and routine urine examination was normal. The patient had a 24-hour urinary protein collection, which showed a 24-hour protein measurement of 67.50 mg. This was confirmed on a repeat sample. Thyroid function tests showed FT3 level of 0.62 pg/mL at the lower limit of the normal range (normal: 0.60-1.95), decreased FT4 level of 4.40 ng/dL (normal: 5.00-11.50) and normal TSH concentration of 1.14 μIU/mL (normal: 0.30-4.00). The concentrations of PTH (230 pg/mL, normal: 10-65) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (4 ng/mL, normal: 10-40) were also measured. Electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes revealed elevated levels of liver isoenzyme. To view the status of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function synachten test was performed, which excluded the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The serological tests for various infectious agents (HBsAg, anti HBC, anti HIV 1+2, Treponemal tests, Brucella Ig G/M antibody levels, TORCH titers) were found to be negative. Ig G, A, M levels were within normal limits. AMA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, anti-LKM-1 were not detected. She was found to have positive ANA in a titer of 1/80 with granular and homogeneous pattern. Positive IgA endomysial antibody (1/80 titer) and IgG antigliaden antibody (98.50 RU/ml) levels were also detected.\nRadiographs of involved joints revealed no evidence of bony erosions, chondrocalcinosis or deformity. Findings on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and chest radiograph, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography images were all normal. Abdominal ultrasonography displayed enlarged liver (155 mm in maximum cranial-caudal extent) and increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma (Grade 1). On thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomographic examination multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, with a largest diameter of 18 × 10 mm, were detected. DEXA scan of the lumbar spine and right hip showed low bone mineral density (BMD) with a total T score of - 5.7 and 4.9, respectively.\nTo examine the upper part of the gastrointestinal system esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which revealed grade 1 esophagitis, hypotonic LES, gastritis, erosive bulbitis and hyperemia in the postbulbar duodenum. To confirm the initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease colonoscopy was performed. Findings other than nonspecific hyperemia of the ileal mucosa were not present. Multiple biopsies were obtained from both upper and lower gastrointestinal tract at the time of endoscopic evaluation. CD was histologically confirmed by duodenal biopsies, which revealed total villous atrophy of duodenal mucosa and regenerative hyperplasia. Increased cellularity of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the lamina propria and surface epithelium were observed. Histological examination of the excised tissue also revealed amorphous eosinophilic deposition in the lamina propria and in the wall of some vessels and glands, which was previously found typical for amyloid (Figure ). However, congo-red and crystal violet staining prosedures and immunohistochemical studies showed no amyloid protein. Neither kappa nor lambda monoclonality was detected in lymphoplasmocytoid cells, immunohistochemically. Loose light-green staining of the deposition by trichrome staining was the unique positive finding (Figure ). In the light of these findings, collagenous sprue due to long-standing celiac disease was the last diagnosis, histologically. Specimens obtained from terminal ileum revealed chronic inflammation and subtotal villous atrophy of ileal mucosa.\nOur patient suffered from anorexia and poor oral intake. To increase caloric intake to gain weight total parenteral nutrition was administered by cyclic infusions. After several days diarrhea improved. She was asked to avoid taking gluten and her complaints abated and did not persist. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

His headache started two weeks prior, and he noted temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius in the preceding five days. He denied neck pain, visual complaints, respiratory symptoms, or arthralgias. He denied recent travel, eating unpasteurized milk products, and sexual activity for the last several years. Two days prior to presentation, he was evaluated by the Emergency Department and was discharged with a presumed viral illness. Because of persistent fever and headache, he returned to the Emergency Department where he was admitted for further evaluation.\nHis medical history was significant for open-angle glaucoma and seasonal allergies. Outpatient medications included travoprost and dorzolamide ophthalmic drops. Multiple family members had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and his father had a diagnosis of leukemia. He denied use of tobacco or illicit drugs. He drank alcohol rarely.\nOn examination, his temperature was 39.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 117/78 mmHg, heart rate 75 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 95% on ambient air. He appeared ill, and skin examination was remarkable for a lightly erythematous macular rash on his chest and arms (). The examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nLaboratory data revealed a leukocyte count of 3700/μL (3500 to 10,000/μL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 15 mm/hour (0 to 10 mm/hour), C-reactive protein of 12.3 mg/dL (0.0 to 0.8 mg/dL), ferritin of 1320 ng/mL (18 to 464 ng/mL), aspartate aminotransferase of 66 units/L (13 to 40 units/L), and alanine transaminase of 94 units/L (9 to 51 units/L). Serologic tests for viral hepatitis, HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, syphilis, and Bartonella were nonreactive. Anti-nuclear antibody, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. Chest radiograph and computed tomography of the head, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for lesions suggestive of malignancy or focal infectious process.\nThroughout hospitalization, the patient continued to have daily fevers with temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius. A careful revisitation of his history revealed exposure to opossums around his yard and home. This historical information in combination of his symptoms, rash, and mild transaminitis rendered murine typhus a likely diagnosis. Doxycycline was initiated and was followed by complete resolution of his symptoms within 48 hours. Although an immunofluorescence IgG assay for typhus group antibodies was nonreactive, the patient was discharged to complete a seven-day course of doxycycline.\nOne month after discharge, the patient returned to clinic and was free of symptoms. Serum obtained for an immunofluorescence IgG assay for typhus group antibodies was reactive at a dilution of 1 : 1024, confirming the diagnosis of murine typhus. </Context> <Question> What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? </Question>",

She began to feel thirst, frequent palpitations, and body weight loss from around June 2006, and hyperthyroidism was detected. Her serum free triiodothyronine (T3) was more than 20pg/mL, free thyroxine (T4) was 7.7ng/dL, TSH was less than the detectable level and anti-TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) was 77.5% (normal range, less than 10%). The 24-hour uptake of iodine-123 to the thyroid gland was 38.47% in the right lobe and 44.16% in the left lobe (total 82.63%). A head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast medium revealed thickening of the bilateral ocular muscles, but no evident tumor in the sella turcica (Figure a). The diagnosis was established as Graves’ disease, and propylthiouracil (PTU) was administered. TRAb had fallen to the normal range, and a euthyroid state was achieved in June 2008. However, occasional elevation of free T3 was detected, so PTU administration was continued. Re-elevation of TSH was seen in December 2010 (Figure ). A head MRI revealed abnormal findings in the sella turcica, and she was introduced to the neurosurgical department of Kohnan Hospital in May 2011.\nOn admission her blood pressure was 152/112mmHg. Electrocardiography recorded her heart rate as 70 beats/minute but she complained of frequent palpitations. Her consciousness was clear, and no abnormal neurological signs were detected. Endocrinological examinations in the morning with oral intake of 100mg of PTU revealed free T3 of 2.77pg/mL, free T4 of 1.09ng/dL and TSH of 2.433μIU/mL. Because of her frequent palpitations the thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) loading test without discontinuing PTU was performed, which revealed no abnormal response. All other pituitary hormones were within the normal ranges, and head MR imaging with contrast medium showed an area of less enhancement in the left lateral wing of the sella turcica with a diameter of 5mm (Figure b), and transsphenoidal surgery was planned under a diagnosis of TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.\nThe milky-white soft tumor was enclosed within a thin cellulose-like membrane. Total removal was achieved in addition to medical fixation of the cleavage with pure ethanol. Postoperative histological examination showed diffuse cell arrangement with mild variation in size but without atypism or mitosis of the nucleus (Figure a,b). Immunohistochemical examination disclosed plurihormonal expression of pituitary hormones including TSH-β, and the diagnosis was established as TSH-secreting plurihormonal adenoma (Figure c,d).\nAdministration of PTU was discontinued from the day of surgery. Diastolic blood pressure did not exceed 100mmHg for six days after the operation. Pituitary and thyroid hormones were re-evaluated at 11 days after the operation, showing free T3 was 3.31pg/mL, free T4 was 1.00ng/dL and TSH was 1.567μIU/mL. Additional TRH loading test found no abnormal responses, and she was discharged at 12 days after the operation.

The frequency of emesis had increased to after almost every feeding, and he had decreased urine output. He otherwise had no fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, diarrhea, or sick contacts. He was born at term via uncomplicated vaginal delivery and had previously been well.\nOn initial physical examination, his weight was 3.9 kg, temperature was 36.5°C, heart rate was 147 bpm, blood pressure was 78/44 mmHg, respiratory rate was 70 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. He had mild tachypnea and mild abdominal distention with the liver edge palpated below the costal margin. The remainder of the exam including heart and lungs was within normal limits.\nAn abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of pyloric stenosis. Therefore, an oral feeding trial was attempted. Upon reassessment, however, the infant was found to be in moderate respiratory distress. He was placed on oxygen, and a chest X-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. A capillary blood gas revealed a pH 6.84, PCO2 64 mmHg, HCO3 11 mEq/L, and base deficit of 24. The infant was intubated, and two normal saline fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg were given.\nAn echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart but with severely decreased right and left ventricular systolic function and a left ventricular shortening fraction of 13% (normal range: 28–44%). The cardiac size was normal with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 2 cm (Z score −0.6). Because of the finding of severe ventricular dysfunction, the patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and started on inotropic support with dopamine and milrinone infusions.\nUpon admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 150 bpm. A short PR interval of 50 ms was seen as well as a delta wave resulting in a prolonged QRS duration of 110 ms (). These findings were consistent with ventricular preexcitation, and a diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome was made. Due to the lack of tachycardia observed at initial presentation, however, a diagnosis of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy was suspected but could not be confirmed. Laboratory testing to evaluate inborn errors of metabolism and specific viral serology, and PCR was therefore ordered to possibly delineate an additional underlying diagnosis.\nA follow-up echocardiogram was done on hospital day (HD) 2 that showed complete normalization of ventricular function with an LV shortening fraction of 44%. The patient was therefore weaned off inotropic support and successfully extubated the next day. Later on HD 3, however, the patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) to rates of 260 bpm (). Vagal maneuvers (application of ice to the face) did not affect the rhythm, and IV adenosine was needed to terminate the SVT. Thereafter, multiple recurrences of sustained SVT occurred over the next 24 hours requiring intervention with ice and/or adenosine.\nOral propranolol was initially started, but, due to persistent episodes of SVT, oral flecainide was initiated on HD 6 (~100 mg/m2/day). Except for one very brief self-limited episode of SVT, there were no further sustained tachycardia episodes observed after starting flecainide, and the patient was discharged home on HD 10. He has not had any recurrences on flecainide therapy and has been feeding well without respiratory symptoms. Follow-up echocardiograms have continued to show normal biventricular function. This course confirmed the diagnosis of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to supraventricular tachycardia in a patient with underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

There were also nodes palpable in the left axillar and bilateral inguinal region. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, thorax, and abdomen showed multiple adenopathies involving retroperitoneum, inguinal, iliac, left axillar and left cervical regions, signs of pronounced bone metastasis, and bilateral hydronephrosis (Figures and ). A biopsy of the neck lymphadenopathy was performed and interpreted as probable adenocarcinoma, strongly positive for prostate specific antigen in immunohistochemical study. Full blood count, biochemical investigation, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were abnormal: creatinine 3.9 mg/dL (reference range (RR) 0.7–1.4 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 93 mg/dL (RR: <50 mg/dL), PSA 583 ng/mL, alkaline phosphate 1592 U/L (RR: 40–130 U/L), and LDH 1086 U/L (RR: 135–225 U/L). Following consultation by urology, a digital rectal exam revealed a firm, fixed, and enlarged prostate, highly suspicious of prostate cancer. The patient denied family history of malignant neoplasms, including prostate cancer, and was never subjected to prostate exam or PSA test. He was then submitted to urgent bilateral ureteral stenting due to obstructive acute renal failure secondary to invasion of the ureteral meatus by prostate carcinoma. Transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy revealed bilateral adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score 3 + 5 = 8. The Tc-99m whole body scan confirmed the previous tomography suspicion of axial, sternum, and cranium bone metastasis (). The patient initiated complete androgen blockage and zoledronic acid. Three months later his cervical lymph node enlargement had regressed and serum PSA had decreased to 3.48 ng/mL. Unfortunately 5 months after initiation of hormonal treatment the patient presented with complaints of left red eye, exophthalmos, and sudden decrease in visual acuity (). Head CT showed an intracranial mass originating in the sphenoid bone and compressing the left eye ball. PSA had increased to 80.82 ng/mL and testosterone remained within castration level (<50 ng/dL). Chemotherapy with docetaxel associated with prednisolone was initiated after failure of standard hormonal manipulations and the patient presented clinical improvement with reduction of exophthalmos and pain complaints. After 5 cycles of docetaxel the PSA level increased to 370 ng/mL. The docetaxel, prednisolone, and zoledronic acid therapy was then substituted for denosumab and cabazitaxel, with good clinical and analytical response (current PSA level of 37 ng/mL). </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 17-year-old girl was admitted to a university hospital with lymphadenopathy on the right side of the neck lasting for a week, and she was treated with antibiotics. However, she complained fever, sore throat, and otalgia beginning on the fourth day of hospitalization, and she was transferred to Seoul St. Mary's Hospital at her request on the seventh day of hospitalization.\nThree years prior she had experienced fever with lymphadenopathy on the left side of the neck. She was admitted to the same hospital, treated with antibiotics, and recovered. At that time, she was investigated for nonfunctioning goiter. Thyroid function tests were normal and the levels of antithyroid antibodies were close to the upper limits of normal. The thyroid scan showed diffuse distribution of the radioisotope. Her mother and maternal grandmother have hypothyroidism.\nShe was conscious at the time of transfer to our hospital. Her blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, heart rate was 78 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and body temperature was 38.4℃. She had multiple tender lymph nodes on the right lateral side of the neck and in the right supraclavicular area, and the largest lymph node was 3×2 cm in size. She also had a tender goiter.\nHer laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.6 g/dL), leucopenia (white blood cell count 2,700/µL), and elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 70 mm/hr, C-reactive protein of 0.93 mg/dL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 688 U/L. Laboratory tests for anemia revealed iron deficiency. The test for EBV infection, tuberculin skin test and blood culture were negative. She was negative for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were detected (titer=1:100). Thyroid function tests were normal, but antithyroid peroxidase antibodies and antithyroglobulin antibodies were elevated (). Computed tomography of the neck revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes at levels II, III, IV and V on both sides of the neck and in the right supraclavicular area of the neck ().\nOn the second day of hospitalization, she complained of pruritic skin rashes on her lower extremities. Despite antibiotic and analgesic treatment, the fever persisted, the skin rashes spread to her trunk and upper extremities, her cervical lymph nodes continued to enlarge, and the lymphadenopathy spread to the occipital area. On the sixth day of hospitalization, an excisional biopsy of the enlarged cervical lymph node was performed, and the histopathologic findings were consistent with KFD (). Her fever persisted after the excisional biopsy, so we started the administration of oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) on the seventh day of hospitalization. On the ninth day of hospitalization, the fever disappeared and the skin rashes began to subside. Ultrasonography of her thyroid showed heterogeneous echogenicity of the thyroid gland and a solitary nodule.\nWe diagnosed her with autoimmune thyroiditis on the basis of her family history and the laboratory results. Thus, she was ultimately diagnosed with KFD and autoimmune thyroiditis. Her hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL after one month of iron supplementation. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.4 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 78.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 2700.0 count/µL. To convert 2700.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 2700.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 2700000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.

    "problem": "<Context> A 22-year-old African American male presented to the ER with acute onset of “pressure-like” substernal, nonradiating chest pain. His symptoms started while playing basketball. The pain was associated with shortness of breath and nausea. He had no significant past medical history or family history of coronary artery disease or sudden deaths. He denied excessive caffeine use, smoking, or alcohol intake. There was no reported use of any illicit drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines and was physically very active. Vital signs on admission included blood pressure of 138/89 mmHg, heart rate of 94/min, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. His BMI was 28. Physical examination was unremarkable with no chest tenderness on palpation and no jugular venous distention. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs or additional sounds. The electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in leads II, III, aVF, and V4–V6 (). On subsequent EKGs, the patient had new ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads with dynamic changes. Laboratory studies were pertinent for a troponin-I level of 0.83 ng/ml. The patient was given aspirin and ticagrelor loading doses, metoprolol succinate 25 mg, intravenous morphine, intravenous heparin drip, and sublingual nitroglycerin which did not relieve his chest pain.\nThe patient was taken for emergent cardiac angiography within 60 minutes of presentation and revealed acute dissection with thrombosis of the distal left main coronary artery (LCA) leading into the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Figures and ). An EBU 3.5 guide catheter was advanced over the wire with repeat injection of the left main performed revealing persistence of acute occlusion. Repeat angiography after balloon inflation revealed significant improvement in flow from TIMI 2 to TIMI 4. An extending thrombus was noted in the distal LAD which was suctioned out. Following this, a bare metal stent was inserted in the distal LCA ostial and the proximal LAD (Figures and ).\nAfter catheterization, the patient was pain-free and hemodynamically stable. He was on epitifibatide infusion for a total of 18 hours. Other medications including carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, ticagrelor, and atorvastatin were initiated. The patient's peak troponin went up to 48.56 ng/ml in less than 24 hrs of initial laboratory studies and subsequently was trending down. Additional laboratory studies including hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile were normal. He was also worked up for thrombotic conditions which might lead to arterial thrombi such as homocystinemia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome both of which were negative. Transthoracic echocardiography performed revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function normal with ejection fraction estimated to be 0.50 to 0.54%. There was no patent foramen ovale that might have led to paradoxical embolus. A urine and serum toxicology screen was also done on the patient who came back as negative for cocaine or methamphetamine.\nAfter the procedure, the patient was further questioned to elicit any history that might shine light to the etiology of his STEMI. He admitted to the use of two different weight-loss products (Performix™ stim-free; Performix SST) for the past 1 year, taking one capsule up to three times a day as indicated on the product label. However, he took Performix SST for the first time on the afternoon of presentation, drinking 3 scoops mixed with water, approximately 2 hours before started playing basketball. On reviewing, the contents of the supplement, it was noted to contain synephrine, an epinephrine analogue. Other contents of the mixture consisted of anhydrous caffeine, sensoril ashwagandha extract, bitter orange extract, n-methyltyramine, hordenine, tyramine, octopamine, huperzine A, yohimbine HCL, mucuna pruriens, and Bioperine.

The patient was on triple immunosuppression with steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine and had stable graft function. He was followed-up regularly in the renal transplant clinic and the immediate post-transplant period was uneventful. In 2001, the serum creatinine was gradually increased to 3 mg/dl. He underwent an allograft biopsy, which revealed an interstitial nephritis/tubular atrophy grade II. The cyclosporine dosage was reduced (150 mg/day given twice daily) to minimize the chronic nephrotoxicity and MMF (2 g/day in two divided doses) was substituted for azathioprine to control chronic allograft nephropathy. At that time, the patient was afebrile and had a normal physical examination. After conversion, serum creatinine level fell to 2.5 mg/dl. However, he presented with complaints of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever requiring hospital admission twelve days later. MMF was withdrawn but cyclosporine and prednisolone were continued.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a moderately dehydrated patient with temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure of 105/55 mm Hg, heart rate of 110 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. Abdominal examination showed a moderately distended abdomen with epigastric tenderness, but no mass or rigidity. Laboratory tests demonstrated a serum amylase level of 1550 U/L (normal range, 30 U/L to 110 U/L), and a serum lipase concentration of 364 U/L (normal range, 5.6 U/L to 51.3 U/L). There was a mild rise in serum creatinine value (2.8 mg/dl). A complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 11.4×109/L with 65% neutrophils, a hematocrit level of 32.6%. Liver transaminases, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, lipid profile and electrolytes tests were within the normal ranges. Evaluation for infectious etiology revealed a negative work-up for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen. Blood testing for CMV and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), by PCR was also negative. The electrocardiogram showed normal QRS complexes. Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated an enlarged and heterogeneous of his pancreas with poorly delineated borders, consistent with acute pancreatitis. His gallbladder, biliary duct system and spleen were normal. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed on the basis of laboratory data and imaging findings during hospital admission. He had no history of pancreatitis or other its risk factors. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluid and cyclosporine was withdrawn. However, he developed hypotension and respiratory failure requiring transfer to the intensive care unit for ventilatory and inotropic support. Unfortunately, his symptoms worsened, and despite an intensive care, his clinical state deteriorated and he died one week later and autopsy findings demonstrated acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 34 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 3.1 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 174.0 cm, which is 174.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.74 m. The patient's weight is 74.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 74.0 kg / (1.74 m * 1.74 m) = 24.442 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.4, indicating they are normal weight. Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 69.559 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).

Chest X-ray showed right pulmonary opacity mainly at the basal region with some streaky left retro cardiac opacities (Figure ).\nHe was able to talk in full sentences. Chest examination revealed bilateral basal crackles. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds and regular rhythm, the abdomen was soft, non-tender with normal bowel sounds, and the examination of the nervous system did not reveal any abnormalities. He was started on prophylactic low dose molecular weight heparin (LMWH) subcutaneous injections, two units of convalescent plasma for COVID-19, parenteral remdesivir, and oral dexamethasone 6 mg per oral daily. Over the next seven days, the patient’s oxygen requirement increased gradually despite the treatment, and he ended up on continuous bilevel positive pressure support (BiPAP) with 100% fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). On the ninth day of admission, his work of breathing continued to worsen even on BiPAP. His Chest x-ray showed worse diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, new pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema (Figure ).\nLaboratory findings were notable for leukopenia with white blood cell count of 3.7 per microliter (range: 4.5 to 11.0 X 109 /L), worsening serum creatinine of 1.23 mg/dl (admitted with serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl), d-dimer 827 ng/ml (normal less than 500 ng/ml), serum ferritin 1836 ng/ml (range: 20 to 250 ng/ml), lactate dehydrogenase 363 units/liter (normal range: 140 to 280 units/ liter) and C-reactive protein of 5.3 mg/liter (normal less than 10 mg/liter). He was subsequently intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Given large pneumomediastinum and initiation of invasive ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ranging from 8 to 10 centimeter of water, chest tubes were also placed preemptively. An X-ray taken the next day incidentally showed free air under the diaphragm apart from the pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral chest tubes (Figure ) with similar findings in computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure ). However, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any evidence of bowel perforation but did show a large pneumoperitoneum (Figure ).\nGeneral surgery was consulted for the pneumoperitoneum. They recommended managing the patient conservatively due to the absence of evidence for bowel perforation on computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. The patient’s abdomen started getting softer and less distended in the next few days. Pneumoperitoneum resolved after five days of diagnosis with the improvement of pneumomediastinum (Figure ). </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 47 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 1.23 mg/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 1.23^(-1.154) * 47^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=63.074. Hence, the patient's GFR is 63.074 mL/min/1.73m².",

    "problem": "<Context> In January 2018, an 85-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with vascular purpura on her lower limbs, chest, and abdomen. She was a housewife and reported no recent travel history. There was no history of urticarial or other allergic symptoms, and she had no familial history. She had no history of smoking tobacco and alcoholism. She had a previous history of hypertension treated with amlodipine besylate for 20 years and no other medication (she was not administered new drugs). She described no trigger factors for purpura. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature, 37.2 °C; pulse, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 120/78 mmHg; and respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute.\nA physical examination revealed significant pitting edema in both lower legs, and the confluence of palpable purpura that formed several patches of different sizes in her lower limbs, chest, and abdomen (Fig. ). There were no remarkable features in her heart, lungs, or abdominal examinations. A neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. She was afebrile and there were no signs of an infectious focus in examinations of each system. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 23.3 × 109/L, eosinophil cell count of 13.5 × 109/L, red blood cell count (RBC) of 299 × 1010/L, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 152 × 109/L (Table ). The serum total protein level was 8.2 g/dL (normal range, 6.9–8.2 g/dL), the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 280 IU/L (normal range, 106–211 IU/L), the aspartate transaminase level was 50 U/L (normal range, 5–40 U/L), the alanine transaminase level was 40 U/L (normal range, 5–35 U/L), the alkaline phosphatase level was 1564 U/L (normal range, 104–338 U/L), and the C-reactive protein level was 6.6 mg/dL (normal range, below 0.3 mg/dL). The serum creatinine level was 2.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.40–0.80 mg/dL) and nephrotic-range proteinuria was noted. Hypocomplementemia with elevated C1q levels was observed. Serum antinuclear antibodies, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all negative. Cryoglobulins and the hepatitis B and C panels were negative. The serum β2-microglobulin level was 13.5 μg/dl (normal range, < 2.0 μg/dl), and immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and κ-light chain concentrations were 43.8 g/L (normal range, 8.7–17 g/L), 2455 IU/mL (normal range, 10–340 IU/mL), and 515 mg/dL (normal range, 3.3–19.4 mg/dL), respectively. Serum protein electrophoresis disclosed a monoclonal spike in the γ-globulin region and urine electrophoresis also revealed a monoclonal spike. Serum immunofixation electrophoresis confirmed the presence of an IgG-κ chain monoclonal M component. A bone marrow (BM) examination showed that plasma cells and eosinophils were 16.2% and 28.6%, respectively (Fig. ). A karyotype analysis showed 46,XX (20/20 cells). Interphase fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization (FISH) of BM cells revealed no gene abnormalities in 1q21, RB1, P53, D13S319, or IgH. A skeletal survey X-ray found no osteolytic lesions. A biopsy sample of accessory salivary glands showed no amyloidosis. A skin biopsy sample revealed LV showing angiocentric, neutrophilic segmental inflammation with endothelial cell swelling and fibrinoid necrosis on blood vessel walls (Fig. ). A cellular infiltrate around the vessels showed leukocytoclasia of neutrophil nuclei. IgG or IgA deposits around the vessel walls were not clear. Although hypocomplementemia was noted, no manifestations suggesting autoimmune diseases and cryoglobulinemia were observed. Allergic purpura was less likely because of the absence of abdominal pain and arthralgia. Drug-induced purpura was also not suspected because no causative drug was being taken.\nThe serum level of IFN-γ, which was secreted by Th1, was lower than 0.1 IU/ml (normal range, lower than 0.1 IU/mL) (Table ). Serum levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 secreted by Th2 were 50.3 pg/mL (IL-4 normal range, lower than 6 pg/mL), 56.1 pg/mL (IL-5 normal range, lower than 3.9 pg/mL), and 76.2 pg/mL (IL-6 normal range, lower than 4 pg/mL), respectively. IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-10, and TGF-β levels were lower than 31 pg/mL (IL-3 normal range, lower than 31 pg/mL), lower than 8 pg/mL (GM-CSF normal range, lower than 8 pg/mL), 45 pg/mL (IL-10 normal range, lower than 5 pg/mL), and 8.74 ng/mL (TGF-β normal range, 1.56–0.24 ng/mL), respectively.\nOur patient was diagnosed as having MM IgG-κ chain type, stage IIIA according to the Durie-Salmon system and stage II according to the International Staging System. Following a definite diagnosis, she received a VRD regimen: bortezomib, 1.0 mg/m2, days 1, 4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide, 15 mg/day, days 1–21, and dexamethasone 20 mg/day, days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. After one course of the treatment, the cutaneous manifestation rapidly improved (Fig. ). Laboratory tests showed a WBC count of 5.4 × 109/L, eosinophil cell count of 0.2 × 109/L, RBC count of 305 × 1010/L, Hb concentration of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 286 × 109/L (Table ). The serum total protein level was 7.6 g/dL, the LDH level was 204 U/L, the aspartate transaminase level was 15 U/L, the alanine transaminase level was 12 U/L, the alkaline phosphatase level was 332 U/L, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.13 mg/dL. The serum creatinine level was 0.82 mg/dL and serum levels of complement bodies were normalized. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgE, and the κ-light chain decreased (13.2 g/L, 218 IU/mL, and 24.2 mg/dL, respectively). The serum level of IFN-γ was elevated (6.5 IU/mL). Serum levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-β decreased (< 6 pg/mL, < 3.9 pg/mL, 3.4 pg/mL, < 5 pg/mL, and 0.48 ng/mL, respectively). In the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the ratio of Th1/Th2 increased. A BM examination showed decrease of plasma cells (3%). She achieved and maintained a very good partial response (VGPR) following VRD regimen for nine cycles without recurrence of LV and eosinophilia. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 85 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (2.1/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**85 * 1.012 = 22.664. Hence, the GFR value is 22.664 ml/min/1.73 m².",

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old male was admitted to the Department of Cardiology, Daejeon St. Mary’s Hospital (Daejeon, Korea), for the evaluation of exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III), palpitations, and bilateral leg pitting edema for several months. His electrocardiography and Holter monitoring showed atrial fibrillation and rare premature ventricular complexes. He underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which showed RCM with biatrial enlargement and small pericardial effusion (A–D). His coronary artery angiogram was normal and other secondary causes of RCM were not found. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images revealed normal left ventricle (LV) chamber size, borderline diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy and very large atria. Contrast enhanced CMR images demonstrated extensive transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the apical wall and mid myocardial patchy LGE in the ventricular septum (E–H).\nWe recommended clinical evaluation and genetic counseling for his family members because he presented a family history of heart disease, with two affected daughters. The proband’s second daughter had mild exertional chest discomfort. Her TTE showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy of the LV and a mildly dilated left atrium (LA) (A–D). Her diastolic dysfunction was grade I according to the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging criteria []. The proband’s fourth daughter also had asymmetric septal hypertrophy of the LV, with mild enlargement of the LA (E–H). CMR images of the two daughters showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy of the LV, consistent with a diagnosis of HCM. LGE was not found in either daughter.\nTo resolve the potential genetic cause of cardiomyopathy in a Korean family (I-1, II-2, and II-4 in A), the proband’s genomic DNA was analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). The exomic DNA of the proband was enriched using Agilent’s SureSelect XT Human All Exon v5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and paired-end sequencing was conducted on an Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for the detection of variants, given the suspicion of familial disease. Base calling, alignment, variant calling, annotation, and quality control reporting were performed using a GATK Best Practices workflow for germline short variant discovery and were manually reviewed by medical laboratory geneticists. In particular, the annotation of the identified variants with respect to the results of their mutation in the reported genes was estimated using the dbNSFP [] and Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor []. By estimating sequence quality along all sequences, 5973 million reads were generated from the proband. A percentage of bases above the average of 30× was achieved for 92.3% of the target region, and the mean read depth (×) was 110. WES of the proband identified five heterozygous variants within the coding region of each gene as candidate causes of autosomal dominant inherited heart diseases with a population allele frequency within the Genome Aggregation Database < 0.001. To determine which variant was the cause of cardiomyopathy in the affected family members, Sanger sequencing was performed additionally. As a result, Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of a heterozygous frameshift mutation (NM_000256.3:c.3313_3314insGG; p.Ala1105Glyfs*85) in MYBPC3 in the proband (I-1) and his affected daughters (second (II-2) and fourth (II-4)), but not in his unaffected granddaughter (III-3) (B). The variant is not listed in public genome databases from gnomAD (; accessed on 8 November 2020) and the Korean Reference Genome Database (; accessed on 8 November 2020). Although the four remaining variants (KALRN: NM_007064.5: c.1702C>T, p.Pro568Ser; KCNH2: NM_000238.4:c.442C>T, p.Arg148Trp; SKI: NM_003036.4: c.30T>G, p.Cys10Trp; TTN: NM_133378.4: c.54293T>C, p.Ile18098Thr) were the likely candidates, there was no exact correlation between the genotype of these variants and the clinical phenotype in the proband and his family members as determined by Sanger sequencing.

    "problem": "<Context> A 62-year-old man presented to his local hospital after 1 month of mucous and bloody stool and 2 weeks of worsening abdominal pain. He had leukocytosis (1.4 × 104/μL), thrombocytopenia (6.4 × 104/μL), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 71 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (2.56 mg/dL) levels. The patient was admitted with a suspicion of sepsis secondary to intraabdominal infection, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated. However, his condition deteriorated, and after 7 days, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Chiba University Hospital.\nOn admission to the ICU, the 165.3 cm tall patient weighing 99.3 kg was fully conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale E4V5M6), but he had a tendency to somnolence. His blood pressure was 154/103 mm Hg, heart rate 115/minutes, respiratory rate 30/minutes, body temperature 37.9 °C, and SpO2 96% on room air. The conjunctiva and skin were icteric. The chest was clear to auscultation. There was abdominal distention with mild hypogastric tenderness but no sign of peritoneal irritation. There was pitting edema in the upper and lower extremities. The white blood cell count was 1.2 × 104/μL, C-reactive protein level was 23.9 mg/dL, and procalcitonin level was 8.92 ng/mL, which were consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial infection. The platelet count had dropped to 3.8 × 104/μL, and the prothrombin time was 41% with a fibrin degradation product level of 53.1 μg/mL, indicative of coagulopathy. The lactate dehydrogenase level was 392 IU/L, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were 50 and 17 IU/L, respectively, and also total and direct bilirubin levels were 6.2 and 4.6 mg/dL, respectively; however, other indicators of hemolysis, including anemia and schistocytosis, were absent. The BUN had increased to 92 mg/dL and the creatinine level was stable at 2.09 mg/dL. The CH50 level was 40.6 U/mL (normal range: 30–50 U/mL), the C3 level was 85 mg/dL (normal range: 65–135 mg/dL), and the C4 level was 23 mg/dL (normal range: 13–35 mg/dL).\nThe patient's clinical course is summarized in the Fig. . Since a stool culture test on ICU admission identified Enterococcus species and Corynebacterium striatum, a diagnosis of severe sepsis derived from bacterial enteritis was established and wide-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Continuous hemodiafiltration was initiated on ICU day 3 but oliguria progressed to anuria, thrombocytopenia persisted, and laboratory values did not improve. Blood, urine, and spinal fluid cultures taken on admission to the ICU were all negative, which eliminated the possibility of additional foci of infection. Two polyps (one each in the sigmoid colon and the rectum) were discovered on lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, which were diagnosed at histopathology as early-stage nonhemorrhagic adenocarcinoma. The polyps did not appear to be the cause of the bloody stool. Additional laboratory evaluations were negative for other hematological disorders or connective tissue diseases. On ICU day 9, schistocytosis (0.5%) was noted on the peripheral blood smear, and a diagnosis of TMA was established. The Hct level also had dropped to 23.5% on the same day and the declining trend continued, therefore red blood cell transfusion was performed days later when he complained dyspnea. Plasma exchange (PE) therapy was initiated on ICU day 11. The patient had only a slight remission of thrombocytopenia after a total of 8 PE sessions (2.1 × 104/μL before the 1st PE and 5.9 × 104/μL after the 8th PE), but there was no notable clinical improvement and the anuria persisted (Fig. ). The level of ADAMTS13 activity in a plasma sample collected from the patient prior to initiation of PE was 25.1%, and the sample was negative for ADAMTS13 inhibitor. These findings eliminated the possibility of TTP. Furthermore, the stool was negative for Shiga toxin-producing-strains of Escherichia coli, and the serum titer for anti-Shiga-toxin antibody was also negative, eliminating the possibility of HUS. Although we considered TMA secondary to colorectal cancer in the differential diagnosis, the endoscopic findings of intramucosal carcinoma and negativity for tumor markers eliminated this possibility. Careful consideration of other possible causes, previous history, and drug history failed to identify an extrinsic etiology of TMA in this patient, and we ultimately suspected aHUS as the cause. Accordingly, intravenous eculizumab treatment (900 mg, once a week) was initiated on ICU day 26. An increase in urine output was observed on the next day, and renal support was successfully discontinued on the same day. And also marked recovery of the platelet count was obtained in combination with the effectiveness of supportive therapy including PE. Biweekly eculizumab infusion was repeated 4 times and then discontinued.\nAfter approval by the institutional review boards of Chiba University, the University of Tokyo, and National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, an anticomplement factor H (CFH) antibody assay and an analysis of complement factor H-related (CFHR) genes were performed using a blood sample collected from the patient prior to initiation of PE. Also written informed consent was obtained from the patient before the assays. The anti-CFH antibody level was 6.16 AU/mL, which indicated negativity for anti-CFH antibody. We performed the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to screen the copy numbers of CFHR1/3 on chromosome 1q32 using a commercially available kit (MLPA kit P236-A2; MRC-Holland, The Netherlands),[ and found that CFHR1/3 did not show gene deletions. However, moderate hemolysis was induced in concomitant hemolytic assays using sheep red blood cells (RBCs), and analysis for mutations potentially associated with aHUS identified a nonsynonymous mutation (p.Ala311Val) in the gene encoding membrane cofactor protein (MCP). All screened genes are presented in the Table .\nThe patient was discharged from the ICU on day 37 and was discharged to home on day 58. He was followed up regularly as an outpatient and was receiving 40 mg/day of prednisolone.

She exhibited no clinical signs suggestive of hyperlipidemia such as tendon xanthomata, eruptive xanthomata, or other skin lesions. According to her family history, her mother had diabetes mellitus, and her father also had diabetes mellitus with hyperlipidemia. Her first pregnancy 1 year prior was influenced by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and severe hyperlipidemia. Her first pregnancy progressed uneventfully, and other antenatal obstetrical examinations throughout her pregnancy were within normal limits. Labor was induced at the 38 weeks of gestation, and a healthy male infant weighing 4,050 g was delivered.\nDuring the laboratory examination of her first pregnancy, functional tests of her liver, kidney, and thyroid were normal. At gestational week 25, she underwent a 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for screening of GDM; after 1 hour, her plasma glucose was 198 mg/dL. Next, 100-g OGTT was administered to the patient, and her plasma glucose levels at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours were 79, 145, 175, and 169 mg/dL, respectively. Therefore, GDM was diagnosed by the Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Lipid levels indicated that her total cholesterol was 451 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 154 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 60 mg/dL, triglyceride was 1,128 mg/dL, and β-lipoprotein was 1,421 mg/dL. Supernatant samples exhibited a turbid, cloudy appearance. GDM and hyperlipidemia were managed by strict dietary control and the administration of omega-3 acid ethyl ester, which was started at 1 g/day. At 35 weeks of gestation, her lipid levels had increased with a cholesterol level at 622 mg/dL and triglyceride level at 3,360 mg/dL. Therefore, the omega-3 acid ethyl ester dose was doubled to 2 g/day. After delivery, the patient's medication was switched to fenofibrate (130 mg/day) at 6 weeks after delivery, her total cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased to 195 and 413 mg/dL, respectively ().\nAt 21 weeks into her second pregnancy, extreme hyperlipidemia and GDM recurred with more severe laboratory findings. Upon administration of 100-g OGTT, her plasma glucose levels at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours were 101, 158, 197, and 166 mg/dL, respectively. And lipid profile showed total cholesterol 693 mg/dL, LDL-C 99 mg/dL, HDL-C 42 mg/dL, triglyceride 3,108 mg/dL, β-lipoprotein 3,066 mg/dL, apo A1 188 mg/dL, and apo B 105 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was managed by strict dietary control and omega-3 acid ethyl esters at 2 g/day until labor. Her pregnancy progressed uneventfully, and labor was induced at the 38th week of gestation; a healthy male infant weighing 3,650 g was delivered. On the following day, she complained of epigastric pain. Peripheral blood tests showed that her cholesterol level was 1,137 mg/dL, triglyceride level was 6,600 mg/dL, amylase level was 179 U/mL (compared with normal ranges, 25 to 115), and lipase level was 133 U/L (compared with normal ranges, 13 to 60). Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed swelling of the pancreas with adjacent fluid collection consistent with acute pancreatitis (). After 4 days of complete parenteral nutrition and fluid therapy, her amylase and lipase levels were normalized. She was discharged 7 days after labor, with improved status of lipid levels with cholesterol 489 mg/dL and triglyceride 702 mg/dL ().\nThe patient experienced recurrent severe hyperlipoproteinemia limited to the gestational period. We performed lipoprotein electrophoresis, apoE genotyping and LPL gene analysis. Furthermore, we measured postheparin plasma LPL activity to elucidate the underlying etiology of the extreme gestational hyperlipidemia. Lipoprotein electrophoresis showed the increase of pre-β region and the decrease of β region (), and her apoE genotype was E3/2. We evaluated the LPL gene on chromosome 8q22, and detected no gene mutation. This test analyzed the entire exon, and the adjacent intron of the LPL gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (Model 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with direct gene sequencing using an automatic nucleotide sequencer (ABI 3130xl, Applied Biosystems). LPL activity was measured using an LPL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (American Diagnostica GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), performed in her nonpregnant state. A blood sample was collected from the patient after overnight fasting, and an intravascular injection of heparin was given (30 U/kg), with 5 mL of postheparin blood samples obtained 15 minutes after the injection []. LPL in samples was trapped on the plate due to the antigen-antibody reaction with the antibovine milk LPL mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-LPL monoclonal antibody) that was coated on the plate. Subsequently, antibovine milk LPL chicken serum (anti-LPL serum) was added, with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antichicken immunoglobulin G goat serum (enzyme-labeled antibody) applied to initiate the antigen-antibody reactions in each sample. The substrate o-phenylenediamine was then added for color development. The absorbance of the developed color was measured to determine LPL levels, which indicated an LPL activity level of 152 ng/mL (compared with normal values, 164 to 284).\nAfter treatment for pancreatitis, her medication was switched to fenofibrate (130 mg/day), and her cholesterol level normalized, ranging from 130 to 200 mg/dL. In contrast, her triglyceride levels were mildly elevated, ranging from 139 to 567 mg/dL. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

There was no other pathology in his physical examination except central cyanosis (72% with pulse oximetry). Normal sinus rhythm with a right axis and right ventricular (RV) dominance were present in the electrocardiographic evaluation. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated TGA and an atrial septal defect of 10 mm in diameter with color Doppler ultrasonography. There was no left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction or outflow obstruction (). There was a banana-shaped LV involution. The LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness was 3 mm (z score: -1.59), end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness was 6 mm (z score: 0.6), end-diastolic LV diameter was 20 mm (z score: -4), and LV mass index (LVMI) was 24.7 gram/m2 (z score: -2.7). The measured LV/RV pressure ratio was 0.5 at the angiography. It was decided to proceed with an arterial switch procedure.\nThe operation was conducted with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) through aortic and bicaval cannulation. Mild hypothermia and del Nido cardioplegia were utilized. Following the preparation of coronaries as small buttons, the LeCompte maneuver was done and ascending aorta was reconstructed via an end-to-end anastomosis. Then, the aortic cross-clamp was released, allowing the neo-aortic root to distend. The ideal locations for the coronary arteries on the neo-aorta were marked with a sterile pen. Stab wounds were made at these marks, taking care not to injure the previously marked anterior neo-aortic commissure, which was marked with a Prolene® suture. Following this, the aortic cross-clamp was reapplied. The location of the anterior neo-aortic commissure was confirmed through the holes, and the openings were enlarged to accommodate the coronary buttons. Pulmonary artery reconstruction was performed after the removal of the cross-clamp with a single autologous pericardial patch that had been treated with glutaraldehyde for three minutes. Ultrafiltration during bypass and modified ultrafiltration after bypass were used. A left atrial pressure monitoring line was inserted through the right superior pulmonary vein before weaning from CPB support.\nThe perioperative scores of the patient were 4, 12, and Class II (adequate minor residua) in the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) score, the Aristotle Comprehensive Complexity (ACC) score, and the Technical Performance Score (TPS), respectively.\nDue to insufficient LV contractions and hypotensive progress following weaning from CPB, the patient was switched to ECMO support at the postoperative 2nd hour in the intensive care unit. Neck cannulation was performed. He was cannulated from the right carotid artery, for the arterial flow, and from the right atrium, for the venous flow. An additional 50 to 100 IU/kg of heparin was introduced according to the initial activated clotting time (ACT). Continued heparin infusion was initiated at a dosage to maintain the ACT at 180 to 200 seconds, and the dosage was titrated. The ECMO pump flow was initiated at 100 ml/kg/min. The pump flow was rearranged after the maintenance of end organ perfusion was ensured, along with the increase in systemic venous oxygen saturation (SO2) and decrease in lactic acidosis.\nInotropic support was administered as milrinone (0.5 µg/kg/min) and a low dose of epinephrine (0.05 µg/kg/min) for the first few postoperative hours. Noradrenaline treatment was added if the coronary perfusion pressure was less than 20 mmHg. Fentanyl and dexmedetomidine were used for sedation and analgesia.\nCardiac functions were evaluated daily by echocardiography. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for oxygenation and to prevent atelectasis. Generally, the frequency was set at 10 to 12 breaths/min, fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 0.35 to 0.45, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 to 10 cmH2O to provide a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) <20 cmH2O.\nThe patient was monitored with daily echocardiographic examinations, electrocardiography (ECG), and hemodynamic findings. The ECMO support was reduced gradually, and the patient was disconnected from it at the end of one week. On the 10th day postoperatively, the general condition of the patient was good, and the LV had returned to the normal shape from the original banana shape (). There was no systolic dysfunction, as confirmed by ECG. The pro B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level decreased from > 35,000 pg/L to 2,100 pg/L.\nAs the patient’s hemodynamic variables progressed to normal values, medical inotropic support was gradually reduced and discontinued completely. Echocardiographic examinations on the 16th day postoperatively demonstrated normal systolic functions with mild insufficiency of the neo-aortic valve and a small left-to-right shunting through the opening left on the atrial septum. The patient was discharged without any neurological sequelae on the 20th day postoperatively ().\nIn the follow-up conducted one month after discharge, the patient was hospitalized again with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Echocardiography revealed moderate mitral and aortic regurgitation with a reduced contraction fraction (20%). The mean pulmonary artery pressure measured by pulmonary regurgitation was 50 mmHg. The patient was treated with antibiotics for three weeks. After treatment, sildenafil, enalapril, and furosemide were initiated due to ongoing pulmonary hypertension and heart failure findings. At the seven-month follow-up, it was observed that regurgitations were reduced, pulmonary artery pressure decreased, and cardiac function normalized (contraction fraction: 30 to 35%, ejection fraction: 60%). One year after the operation, the patient had no issues. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Emergency medical services were called. En-route to the emergency room, she was found pulseless and initial rhythm showed ventricular fibrillation. The patient received CPR for 45 minutes, direct current cardioversion counter shocks of 360 J each, total of 1080 J were implemented and multiple boluses of epinephrine, amiodarone, lidocaine, and magnesium were given to restore effective cardiac rhythm. After the third attempt of defibrillation she converted to sinus rhythm. She was then transferred to the ICU. Her initial arterial blood gas was suggestive of respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.14, Pco2 of 84, and Po2 of 98. She was intubated with pressure support mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 of 100 %, respiratory rate of 32, tidal volume of 400 mL, and positive end expiratory pressure of 5. Her vital signs after the event were as follows; blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, pulse was 110/min, and oxygen saturation was at 95% with the ventilation setting. Electrocardiogram after the event showed sinus tachycardia. Chest roentgenogram was suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Her troponin level was 0.18 ng/mL (normal range <0.04 ng/mL) followed by 0.44 ng/mL and 0.43 ng/mL. On examination the patient was minimally following command. Her breath sound was coarse bilaterally with no other remarkable physical examination findings. Her initial laboratory work up showed potassium of 4 mmol/L (normal reference 3.7-5.1 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen of 35 mg/dL (normal reference 6-24 mg/dL), and creatinine of 1.70 mg/dL (normal reference 0.50-1.10 mg/dL). Echocardiography of the heart showed ejection fraction of 50%-55% and motion wall abnormality of basal, mid anterior, and inferior wall suggestive of underlying MI, which was a new finding as compared to the old report. Cardiac catheterization could not be performed due to her critical condition. On second day of her hospitalization, she started became anuric (urine output <100ml/24 h) and her creatinine started rising up causing acute kidney injury (AKI). Her further laboratory works up during the hospital course are listed in the table (Table ). Her urinalysis showed no red blood cells, pyuria or bacteria, but did show some granular casts. A renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction, and her fractional sodium was found to be 4.5%. The patient’s CK level peaked at 6380 U/L (normal range 26-192 U/L), myoglobin was >20,000 ng/mL (normal range 9-83 ng/mL), and myocardial bound (CK-MB) isoenzyme of CK was 4.5 ng/mL (normal range 0-3.6 ng/mL). The patient’s renal function did not improve with fluid loading as a part of resuscitation post CPR initially considering it to be prerenal cause or with stress dose furosemide (1 mg/kg) after the diagnosis of intrinsic AKI was made. However, her plasma creatinine rose to 5.71 mg/dL. She was started on hemodialysis. However, her kidneys continued to show minimal renal recovery and the patient was transferred to a long-term care facility. Elective left heart catheterization was done after a month later as per cardiology recommendation. She was found to have total occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) and received percutaneous coronary intervention to RCA. However, her renal recovery has been minimal and the patient still receiving hemodialysis three times a week. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 69 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 5.71 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (5.71/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**69 * 1.012 = 7.538. Hence, the GFR value is 7.538 ml/min/1.73 m².",

He fell ill after heavily consuming alcohol for a day. Three and a half hours prior to his arrival, he experienced discomfort in his chest followed by vomiting. Two hours and 20 min prior to his arrival, he felt nauseated, describing a feeling of sudden stiffness throughout his entire upper body. On arrival, he was alert, his blood pressure was 139/98 mmHg, pulse rate was 64/min and regular, body temperature was 36.5 °C, respiratory rate was 20/min, and oxygen saturation was 95%. He was 173 cm tall and weighed 73.1 kg. No abnormalities other than cold sweat and epigastric tenderness were noted on physical examination. Chest radiography of the lateral view (seated position) showed several areas of free-air just below the diaphragm (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed free-air, bilateral pleural effusion, and a dilated esophagus and stomach (Fig. ). Based on these findings, an esophageal rupture with mediastinitis was the definitive conclusion and he was thus diagnosed with Boerhaave syndrome. A subsequent esophagogram further confirmed the diagnosis. Nine hours after the onset of the rupture, an emergency operation was performed as follows. Through a left thoracoabdominal incision, closure of the perforation and drainage of both the mediastinum and thoracic/abdominal cavities were performed in succession. The penetrating laceration was approximately 3 cm in length vertically on the left posterior wall of the distal esophagus and was patched with the patient’s omentum.

The swelling appeared round with an approximate diameter of 3 cm; it was near the foramen cecum; it had a reddish color; and it had an irregular nonulcerated surface. Fiberoptic endoscopy identified the swelling in the glossoepiglottic area (). It was mobile during deglutition. A thyroid scintigraphy, with technetium-99 pertechnetate, showed a single contrast enhancement in the sublingual region, instead of in the normal anatomical position of the thyroid ().

She was a housewife and frequently worked with potting soils in her garden. She also had orange-coloured sputum (Figure ). Her vital signs upon admission were as follows: temperature, 36.1°C; blood pressure, 109/69 mmHg; pulse rate, 111 beats/min; respiratory rate, 30/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on 9 L/min of oxygen mask with reservoir bags.

Blood gas analysis showed the following: pH 7.397, pCO2 34.4 torr, pO2 46.5 torr and HCO3\n− 21.8 mEq/L (with room air).\nHer chest x-ray showed consolidation in the upper and middle lung fields bilaterally (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed consolidation of the right upper, middle and lower lobes and the left upper, and atelectasis of the left lower lobe (Figure ). Sputum Gram stain showed very few epithelial cells and some neutrophils, but not satisfactory to estimate causative bacteria. Both the BinaxNOW™ pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen test (Abott) were negative.\nWe suspected severe pneumonia and started with intravenous levofloxacin (500 mg q24h) and meropenem (500 mg q6h) empirically. Given her history of RA and SLE, and immunosuppressive state, we thought that viral/fungal infections, alveolar haemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia were important differential diagnoses. Thus, she underwent BAL by bronchoscopy under intubation. The colour of BALF was also orange (Figure ) and the cellular pattern was neutrophil predominant (90.0%) suggestive of bacterial infection. But, Gram stain of the BALF results was negative. Cytology of BALF revealed numerous neutrophils and a few macrophages which were not hemosiderin-laden. Because it has been clinically suggested that the colour of sputum obtained from patients with pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila is orange, we suspected non-pneumophila Legionella species pneumonia. We switched meropenem to azithromycin (500 mg q24h) and increased levofloxacin to maximum dose (750 mg q24h) targeting Legionella species pneumonia. Acid-fast bacillus cultures of sputum resulted negative. Two sets of blood cultures were negative. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for Pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were all negative. On the fifth day, mass spectrometry analysis of colonies obtained by culturing in BCYEα medium from BALF identified the presence of Legionella longbeachae.\nOn the sixth day, her respiratory condition deteriorated and contrast-enhanced CT showed exacerbation of ground-glass opacity (GGO) without pulmonary thromboembolism. We suspected organizing pneumonia secondary to L. longbeachae and started high-dose pulse intravenous steroid treatment with 1 g methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by prednisolone 1 mg/kg (60 mg/day) alongside levofloxacin that was administered 21 days in total.

Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 111.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 30510.0 count/µL. To convert 30510.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 30510.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 30510000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 30.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 34.4 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met. Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3.",

Arterial blood gas was metabolic acidosis (pH 7.29, PO2 76 mm Hg, PCO2 34 mm Hg, HCO3 18 mEq/L). Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) angiography was performed to test for thromboses, which revealed a thrombosis in the infrarenal aorta (), and thorax CT angiography revealed pleural effusions of 2.8 cm in the right hemithorax and 1.6 cm in the left hemithorax, prevalent ground-glass areas in the parenchyma of both lungs, and reticulonodular infiltrates showing nodule formation, which were dominant in the upper lobe of the left lung but prevalent in both lungs.\nPatient was presented with instantaneous severe lower limb pain, coolness, paleness, and absence of pulses and CT angiography confirmed infrarenal aorta thrombosis. Therefore, we decided to perform emergency surgery. Under local anesthesia bilateral common femoral artery exposed and femoral embolectomies were performed after the administration of heparin, and a large amount of fresh thrombus material was retrieved. Immediately after femoral circulation was restored. After the operation the patient was transferred to intensive care unit.\nIn the postop laboratory evaluations the following results were obtained: glucose 139 mg/mL, BUN 41 mg/dL, CRE 4 mg/dL, ALT 103 IU/L, AST 641 IU/L, CK 11915 IU/L, LDH 2625 IU/L (135–225 IU/L), sodium 129 mEq/L, potassium 6.0 mEq/L, INR 2.2, leucocyte count 17000/mm3, Hb 10 gr/dL, Htc 30, and Plt 187 000 mm3 (lymphopenia presence 3%). Urinalysis was not performed because the patient was anuric. Enoxaparin treatment was initiated due to thrombosis. Empirical moxifloxacin treatment was given owing to the prediagnosis of pneumonia. No growth was reported in the blood culture. The patient was diagnosed as having anuric acute kidney injury (AKI), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 3 and taken into hemodialysis after catheterization. Autoantibody analysis was requested because of the AKI etiology and the results (P-ANCA, C-ANCA, anti-Ds DNA, and ANA) were negative with negative components and negative rheumatoid factor. In the analyses requested to evaluate thrombosis, anti-thrombin III and protein C values were normal, protein S 50% (55–160) was slightly low, and anticardiolipin and antiphospholipid antibody results were negative. Serum Legionella pneumophila was negative in the patient who had hyponatremia (sodium 129 mmol/L) and pneumonia.\nPCR analysis conducted on nose and throat swap samples was positive for H1N1. Oseltamivir was added to the patient's treatment. Four units of erythrocyte suspension were given upon a decrease in the patient's Hb value. Fever was detected in the follow-up examination conducted two weeks after the initiation of treatment and cultures were taken from the patient. Piperacillin-tazobactam was added to the treatment.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are reported to be present and so three points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 3 = 3. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 3 + 3 = 6. The patient's heart rate is 108.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 6 + 1.5 = 7.5. Because the patient did not have an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient had a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 7.5 + 1.5 = 9.0. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 9.0. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 9.0. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 9.0.

She had being lived on cow milk products for 24 years in Inner Mongolia before she married a man in Guilin. As an aboriginal inhabitant, fresh milk and milk products were her favorite. She had 1-year history of renal biopsy-proven MGN with persistent proteinuria (2.5–5.5 g/24 hours). The lady was admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University in March 2014.\nThe patient was first admitted to the People's Hospital of Guilin with complaints of generalized edema in her face and legs in March 2013. No other abnormalities had previously been detected on her annual physical examinations.\nThe results of physical examination revealed normal, except for 2+ pitting pretibial edema and lower eyelids swelling. Laboratory measurements were as follows: total serum protein, 44.8 g/L (normal 60–80 g/L); albumin, 24.6 g/L (normal 35–50 g/L); total cholesterol, 7.91 mmol/L (normal 3.1–6.0 mmol/L), triglycerides, 1.22 mmol/L (normal 0.48–1.6 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein, 1.49 mmol/L (normal 1.0–1.9 mmol/L); and low-density lipoprotein, 4.43 mmol/L (normal 2.1–3.36 mmol/L). The levels of liver enzymes, blood electrolytes, and the results of blood routine examination were basically within the normal ranges. Urinalysis showed the presence of urine dipstick protein of 3+, 24-hour urine protein level of 5.5 g/day (normal 0.04–0.23), blood urea nitrogen of 2.65 mmol/L (normal 3.2–7.5 mmol/L), and creatinine of 55.5 μmol/L (normal 44–115 μmol/L).\nShe was hospitalized to have percutaneous kidney biopsy performed on the 21st March, 2013.

Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "240.711",
    "Upper Limit": "266.049",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's LDL cholestrol, apply the following formula: LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL - (triglycerides / 5), where the units for total cholestrol, HDL cholestrol, and triglycerides are all mg/dL. The concentration of total cholestrol is 7.91 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 7.91 mmol. To convert 7.91 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.91 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.008 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.008 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 3.093 g total cholestrol. To convert 3.093 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.093 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 3093.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3093.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 309.3 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 7.91 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 309.3 mg total cholestrol/dL.  The concentration of hdl cholestrol is 1.49 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 1.49 mmol. To convert 1.49 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.49 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.387 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.387 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.387 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 1.49 mmol hdl cholestrol/L converts to 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL.  The concentration of triglycerides is 1.22 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of triglycerides from mmol to mg. The mass of triglycerides is 1.22 mmol. To convert 1.22 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.22 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 0.861 g triglycerides. To convert 0.861 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.861 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 861.0 mg triglycerides. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 861.0 mg triglycerides/10.0 dL = 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL. The concentration value of 1.22 mmol triglycerides/L converts to 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL.  Plugging in these values will give us 309.3 mg/dL - 38.7 mg/dL - (86.1/5) mg/dL = 253.38 mg/dL. The patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 253.38 mg/dL.",

He had gradually progressive symptoms of involuntary, hyperkinetic movements and weakness of both upper and lower limbs. Autonomic dysfunction had manifested in the form of excessive sweating and insomnia. Behavioral abnormalities along with auditory hallucinations were also present.\nGeneral examination findings revealed signs of autonomic dysfunction as his resting pulse rate remained consistently above 110 beats/min, whereas his blood pressure was found to be frequently elevated above 160/100 mm of Hg. Wasting of muscles of all four limbs was also evident.\nLaboratory investigations initially unveiled hypokalemia (serum potassium: 3.2 mEq), with hypoproteinemia(total protein: 5.8 g/dl, albumin: 3.8 g/dl, and globulin: 2.0 g/dl).\nHe was further evaluated for possible causes of neuromyotonia. The patient had a positive serum anti-CASPR2 antibody, a subtype of VGKC complex detected by using immunofluorescence method and considered to be the hallmark of Morvan syndrome.[]\nInitial treatment with high-dose steroids and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for 2 weeks offered no improvement in his condition. Given progression of the disease, decision to carry out therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was considered. As per the latest ASFA guidelines (2016), <100 cases have been reported in the literature,[] where TPE has been used as a treatment option for reducing antibodies against VGKC. Morvan syndrome also falls under this broad category of neurological disorders and a Category II indication for carrying out TPE. A thorough review of literature was carried out and considered in context of McLeod's criteria, which states if the disorder's pathophysiology is understood and the apheresis procedure could modify it, the risk–benefit ratio of carrying out TPE should be evaluated. The same was done for this patient and as the potential benefits outweighed the risks, the decision to carry out the procedure was considered appropriate.[]\nA double-lumen femoral line was placed under strict aseptic precautions for carrying out TPE, using MCS plus 9000 (Hemonetics, Unites States) apheresis platform. Another peripheral venous access was established for infusion of calcium. Patient's potassium levels were corrected before the start of the procedure. FFP and saline were chosen as the replacement fluid (in the ratio of 70:30). Although albumin is considered the ideal replacement fluid, it could not be used in this case due to financial constraints of the patient. The procedure was carried out in an Intensive Care Unit in view of abnormal vital parameters. Patient's total plasma volume was calculated as per his body weight, and 100% of this total plasma volume was exchanged (1 plasma exchange) on alternate days for five sessions of TPE.\nThe process of carrying out TPE proved to be very challenging from the 1st cycle. Persistent hyperkinetic movements of all the limbs caused recurrent hindrance to the flow through femoral line and tubing. The process had to be paused intermittently to manually rectify the obstruction and restore normal flow. Constant vigil on tubing was required to avoid kinks and maintain a normal flow rate. Later, the patient had to be restrained by cuffing the limbs, after obtaining consent from his relatives. Tablet methyl prednisolone was also given to the patient as part of the management along with tablet clonazepam for its antiepileptic as well as sedative effect.\nThe patient developed an allergic reaction to FFP during the first sitting itself in the form of rashes over entire body which subsided on treatment with antihistamines. Rest of the TPE sessions were carried out after premedicating the patient with antihistamines, and allergic reaction to FFP was not observed again.\nDue to persistently elevated blood pressure (>160/100 mm of Hg) and tachycardia (>110 bpm), any further rise in his vital parameters during the procedure could have been detrimental. To ensure optimum safety of the patient, the entire procedure was carried out in an Intensive Care Unit, and an intensivist was on standby in case of any eventuality.\nHis serum protein was on lower side (5.2 g/dL) before the start of TPE. The patient was also transfused with four units of FFP postprocedure, after each TPE session. This enhanced FFP support rectified his total serum proteins (7.2 g/dL) before the fourth TPE commenced. Flow rate and amount of fluid exchanged were kept at lower levels during each exchange cycle, using apheresis bowl of a lower volume (125 ml) to ensure that the patient remained hemodynamically stable. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

She usually had a dry cough after a cold, which did not last for more than 2 months. Following a diagnosis of acute eosinophilic bronchitis and focal pneumonia, the patient was administered antibiotics. However, her pneumonia did not improve and she was transferred to our hospital for further examination.\nShe had no disease and no operation history. She was nonsmoker and social drinker. She had no family history and her occupation was teacher.\nBlood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, respiration rate was 20 per minute, and body temperature was 36.8℃. General findings indicated no pain, but chest auscultation revealed minor rales in the right middle lobe. Heart auscultation revealed a normal beat without cardiac murmur. No edema was observed in the abdomen or extremities, and no lymph node enlargement was apparent.\nThe results of an arterial blood gas examination performed at the time of admission were PH 7.43, PaCO2 33 mm Hg, PaO2 78 mm Hg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L.

Electrolytes and blood glucose levels were normal, and urine examination revealed specific gravity of 1.025, pH 6.0, no proteinuria, and a red blood cell count of 30-49 per high-power field. Subsequent examination revealed no worsening of hematuria. Empirical antibiotic treatment, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) sputum smear, and sputum eosinophil tests were performed, in order to differentiate community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Sputum bacteria examination did not yield specific findings, and very few sputum eosinophils were observed.

Electrocardiography and echocardiography yielded normal results, and pulmonary function examination revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.83 L (90% of reference), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) 2.27 L (93% of reference), FEV1/FVC 92%, and diffusion capacity adjusted by the alveolar volume 97%, indicating mild obstructive ventilation disturbance.\nSimple chest radiography revealed nodular lesions around the pulmonary hilum of the right upper lobe (). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 1.8-cm speculated nodule around the inferior margin of the right upper lobe, and the differential diagnosis of focal pneumonia or lung cancer was required (). A bronchoscopy revealed no abnormalities in the bronchi. Kidney ultrasonography and a gastroscopy that were performed to confirm the amyloidosis lesions did not yield specific findings; so video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)-assisted pulmonary wedge resection was conducted for early differentiation of lung cancer.

The blood test revealed a blood glucose level of 26.8 mmol/L (482 mg/dl), pH 6.902, base excess (BE) of − 29.3 mmol/L, HbA1c of 12.9%, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.11 mEq/L and ketone level of 6.1 mmol/L. The patient was treated according to the recommendations of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes and the Polish Diabetes Association [, ].\nInitially the patient received 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl IV infusion. Next, a continuous IV infusion of short acting insulin was commenced with 2,5 U/ h dose, taking into consideration that the patient weight was 40 kg. IV Insulin infusion was sustained for 51 h with dosages ranging from 1,5 U/h to 4 U/h. Overall the patient received 81,75 units of IV insulin during the first 24 h of treatment. Moreover, potassium was supplemented intravenously accordingly to changes in electrolytes results. Although she remained in a serious condition during the first 24 h of treatment, she stopped vomiting and showed gradual improvement in blood test results, with pH normalization and a decrease in the level of ketones. The glucose level was maintained between 8.3 and 13.9 mmol/L (150–250 mg/dl) with intravenous insulin and glucose infusions. The neurological status was checked hourly, and was reported as stable. An ECG was performed within the first few hours of admission, which did not reveal any crucial abnormalities aside from tachycardia. The patient received 65 units of IV insulin during the second 24 h f treatment. During the whole continuous insulin infusion the patient fluid input was 7850 ml (4750 ml IV, 3100 ml orally) and diuresis was 3400 ml.\nThe patient’s overall condition improved during the second day of treatment, despite the fact that she was still receiving intravenous insulin. That day irregular heartbeats were noticed on auscultation during the physical examination and on the ECG monitor. A second ECG showed premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; also known as trigeminy) with LBBB (left bundle branch block) morphology and a normal axis (Fig. ). Continuous ECG monitoring was subsequently implemented, and the patient underwent a cardiac consultation. The echocardiogram showed no abnormalities in the structures of the heart and great vessels. The consultant cardiologist confirmed the diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia (PVCs). The blood results revealed hypokalemia (nadir at 2.9 mmol/L) and hypophosphatemia (nadir at 0.45 mmol/L).\nThe ECG performed after the first recognition of the patient’s the irregular heart rhythm (Fig. ) showed: sinus rhythm at 100/min, normal cardiac axis, with premature ventricular complexes. Normal PQ interval (0,14 s), normal QRS duration (0,08 s), normal QT interval (0,31 s)and QTc 0,40 QTd 0,04 s. Normal T wave and repolarization. The biochemistry results at that moment were: Na 134 mmol/L Na 134 mmol/l [132–145]; K 3,56 mmol/l [4,1-5,3]; Ca 2,70 mmol/l [2,1-2,6]; Mg 0,83 mmol/l [0,53-1,11]; Phosphate 0,45 mmol/l [1,1-2,0] (assessed for the first time); pH 7,34 [7,35-7,45]; BE-11,5 mmol/l [− 2,0/+ 3,0]; HCO3 14,2 mmol/l [22,5-30,0]. CK level was not determined. The pattern visible in the ECG was not typical of hypokalemia, which is connected with initial T-wave decrease, followed by ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, PR interval prolongation and increased P-wave amplitude, observed with further decreases in serum potassium levels. Severe hypokalemia may be associated with giant U-waves created by T- and U-wave fusion. Tachyarrhythmia and rarely atrioventricular block may evolve [–]. In our case we did not observe such abnormalities typical to low potassium level in the ECG. Moreover, the ECG was not typical of hypercalcaemia, which causes prolonged PQ interval and shortening of QT interval [, ]. Taking above into consideration we propose possible association between hypophosphatemia and premature ventricular complexes reported in the ECG.\nPotassium was supplemented both orally and intravenously. Overall the patient received 123 mEq of potassium during the continuous insulin therapy. As far as phosphorus is concerned, the patient was fed with liquid dairy products that were rich in phosphate, as she was only able to swallow small amounts of non-solid foods due to odynophagia. She was also started on oral phosphate supplementation (phosphate mixture containing 17.8 g Na2HPO4 and 4.88 g NaH2PO4 in 100 ml of distilled water, containing 1.6 mmol of inorganic phosphate per 1 ml). As 1 mmol of inorganic phosphate weighs 31 mg, our patient was receiving 62 mg Pi/kg body weight every 24 h from the phosphate mixture. She continued to present an irregular heart rate, thus a 24-h ECG Holter monitor examination was performed. The results showed 38,000 monomorphic PVCs, 1615 occurrences of ventricular bigeminy, 1230 of ventricular trigeminy and 453 of ventricular quadrigeminy, which comprised 38% of all the heart electrical activity recorded.\nThe patient was started on intensive subcutaneous insulin regimen at the 3 day of treatment, after the biochemistry results improved. In the beginning she was receiving 15 units of ultra- long acting basal insulin and 27,5 units of rapid acting insulin for meals and correction doses.\nThe patient’s serum phosphate level normalized over the few next days of treatment (Table ), and ventricular arrhythmia ceased almost completely. Subsequent ECG Holter examination showed 1760 PVCs, 13 episodes of ventricular bigeminy and 79 episodes of ventricular trigeminy. Additionally, we noticed hypocalcaemia after 3 days of phosphate supplementation. Taking into consideration the patient’s severe vitamin D3 deficiency (25(OH)D3 level 9.83 ng/ml), we supplemented both calcium and vitamin D3.\nGradually the patient regained insulin sensivity and entered a partial remission phase. C- peptide level was 0,84 ng/ml.\nThe patient was discharged in an overall good condition receiving intensive functional insulin therapy. The regimen included 10 units of basal insulin administered once daily in the evening and rapid acting insulin with insulin: carbohydrate ratio set for each meal and also with recommended correction doses.\nA cardiac check-up at the outpatient clinic following discharge revealed no signs of cardiac arrhythmia. The patient is currently on an insulin pump therapy regimen, and her growth and development are within the normal range. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "143.71",
    "Upper Limit": "158.838",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of glucose is 26.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 26.8 mmol. To convert 26.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 26.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.027 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.027 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 4.864 g glucose. To convert 4.864 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 4.864 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 4864.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 4864.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 486.4 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 26.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 486.4 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 142.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (486.4 - 100) = 151.274 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 151.274 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> We report a case of a 37-year-old male with PWS who suffered from ESKD. At 3 years of age, he started overeating and developed obesity. At 5 years of age, PWS was suspected based on the patient’s body type, facial expression, and overeating. Dietary restriction was instructed; however, at 17 years of age, he was diagnosed with type 2 DM (T2DM). At 30 years of age, a diagnosis of PWS was confirmed by genetic testing. At age 32 years, he suffered from nephrotic syndrome, and diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed at the same time.\nBy June 2015, renal function had continuously deteriorated and his serum creatinine reached 8.9 mg/dL (eGFR at 5.0 mL/min/1.73 m2). Therefore, the patient was admitted to the hospital for initiating RRT. At admission, physical examination revealed: 150.8 cm height, 80.3 kg BW, BP 112/64 mmHg, HR 110/min, SO2 99% (room air). He showed systemic edema and urine volume decreased to 800 mL/24 h. The patient’s IQ was inferred 40–60. Blood chemistry showed: TP 6.4 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, CRP 10.9 mg/dL, BUN 83 mg/dL, UA 6.4 mg/dL, Na 136 mEq/L, K 5.4 mEq/L, Cl 110 mEq/L, Ca 7.1 mg/dL, P 12.7 mg/dL and HCO3− 14.7 mEq/L. Complete blood count was: WBC 16,770/μL, RBC 354 × 104/μl, Hgb 8.1 g/dL, Ht 27.6%, MCV 78 fl, MCH 22.9 pg, MCHC 29.3% and Plt 54.2 × 104/μl. Urinalysis showed massive proteinuria (4839 mg/24 h) without hematuria or pyuria. He had been receiving insulin injection 4 times a day. Random blood glucose level was 156 mg/dL and HbA1c was 6.8%.\nAfter admission, restricted fluid intake, nutritional management, and temporary HD was performed 6 times for 2 weeks since massive edema prevented insertion of PD catheter. The reasons for choosing PD were as follows: vessels in his both forearms looked premature for creating A-V fistula at that time, suspecting intolerance in hemodialysis session for long hours and difficult cessation of fluid and food intake which are necessary for hemodialysis. Negative aspect of PD was specifically considered as a difficulty in maintaining sanitary in inlet of PD catheter. In either modality, family burden for supporting his dialysis was also considered.\nSubstantially his body weight decreased to 64 kg (− 16 kg from admission; BMI 28.4 kg/m2) and a catheter for PD was inserted using the non-stylet method under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia at the 14th day of admission. We selected the JBS-2 semi-long PD Catheter with the exit site placed in the left upper abdomen (Fig. ). The catheter position was not ideally located initially but it functioned well for the following PD session after the surgery (Fig. ). From the third postoperative day, nocturnal intermittent PD (NIPD) was started. Since he could not sufficiently understand the procedure of PD, instructions for PD as well as insulin self-injection were provided to his father. He was discharged at the day 35 of hospitalization.\nAt the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 13th month after NIPD introduction, a subcutaneous tunnel infection occurred (Fig. ). Since additional antibiotic therapy could not terminate infection, he underwent subcutaneous pathway diversion and PD catheter replacement for three times consequently. However, that was the last infection episode and infection-free PD was observed until the present time for next 27 months. With regard to the dialysis modality, NIPD was chosen first because he desired to continue his daytime job for handicapped person. At the 7th month after NIPD introduction, the treatment was switched to continuous cycling PD (CCPD) and 7.5% icodextrin solution (Extraneal™, Baxter, Tokyo, Japan) was added daytime because urine output gradually decreased, and ultrafiltration volume became insufficient. At the 10th month after NIPD introduction, glucose concentration in peritoneal dialysate increased from 1.5 to 2.5% (Reguneal™, Baxter, Tokyo, Japan). “Hybrid dialysis”, which combined daily PD with once-a-week HD, was started by creating A-V fistula at the 16th month after NIPD introduction. Owing to this “hybrid dialysis”, adequate ultrafiltration volume was maintained for following 17 months. Dialysis efficiency has been checked by blood tests and chest X-ray once a month and revealed adequate dialysis without major problems; accordingly, BUN level was below 50 mg/dL and serum potassium level below 5 mEq/L. Blood sugar was well maintained by daily intensive insulin therapy with oral dulaglutide initially and then this regimen was successfully replaced with once-weekly GLP-1 agonist associated with once a day ultralong-acting insulin finally. HbA1c had been maintained under 7% since NIPD introduction. His maximum body weight without overhydration reached to 71 kg (BMI 31.6 kg/m2) during this period. Finally, he lost his A-V fistula twice and returned to PD (CCPD) alone at the 38th month of NIPD introduction because of difficulty in creating another vascular access. For evaluating efficacy of PD, serum β2-microglobulin level was monitored every 2 months and revealed between 34 and 40 mg/L during the latest CCPD alone period. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

There was no relevant family history, and the general examination was unremarkable. Breast examination revealed bilateral hard 50 mm masses in each breast's centre, denoting grade IV capsular contracture (as per Baker scale []) and likely failed breast implants, with no other palpable suspicious lumps or axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\nBilateral mammogram and ultrasound scan showed an impalpable, right breast, 10 mm, suspicious mass, which was cored and clipped under ultrasound scan guidance. They also showed bilateral failed collapsed breast implants (Figures -).\nAfter discussing her care in our multidisciplinary meeting, we preceded with right breast radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag-guided wide local excision (Figure ), patent blue and radioactive directed sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and bilateral explantation surrounded by a rim of normal breast tissue (Figure ).\nThe patient had smooth postoperative recovery and was discharged the following day, seen in the clinic the following week with good aesthetic results and no postoperative complications were noted.\nFinal histology revealed a fully excised, right breast, 17 mm, invasive ductal carcinoma, grade II, with intermediate-grade solid and comedo ductal carcinoma in situ, estrogen receptors (ER) 8, progesterone receptors (PR) 8 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, and SLNB 0/2.

There was no family history of bleeding diathesis or hematological diseases. On physical examination, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.8°C, blood pressure 108/69 mm Hg, pulse rate 58 beats/min, and respiratory rate 12 breaths/min. A firm mass was palpable over the left lateral abdominal wall and it was tender. The skin color of the area was normal.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 58.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 174000.0 count/µL. To convert 174000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 174000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 174000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.

    "problem": "<Context> We present the case of a 49-year-old female with restricting-type anorexia nervosa who was voluntary admitted for treatment at the Villa Garda Hospital Eating Disorder Unit, Italy, on 21 December 2015. The treatment based on an adapted inpatient version of CBT-E—an enhanced form of CBT designed to treat patients with eating disorder psychopathology—has a standard duration of 20 weeks, comprising 13 weeks of inpatient therapy followed by 7 weeks of day hospital [, ].\nThe patient reported no psychiatric disorders nor family history for eating disorders or any other significant psychiatric conditions. Her eating disorder had begun at the age of 30 years, when she had a body weight of 49 kg and a body mass index (BMI) of 19.6 kg/m2. After the death of her mother, the patient adopted a strict diet and excessive exercising (i.e., walking for long distances for a duration of 4-5 hours a day), which determined a progressive weight loss of about 10 kg over a few months and the onset of secondary amenorrhoea. In the years that followed the patient maintained a body weight of around 39 kg through extreme and rigid dietary rules and excessive daily exercising. At the age of 48 years, following the loss of her job and the breakup of a relationship, the patient stepped up both her dietary restriction and the duration of exercising and lost roughly 6 kg over the course of one year. At this point she was referred by her general practitioner to our eating disorder unit, which, after an initial assessment and consultation, she agreed to attend as an inpatient.\nAt admission the patient had a body weight of 33 kg, height of 1.57 m, and BMI of 13.4 kg/m2 as well as an oral temperature of 35.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, with no evidence of orthostatic changes. Her eating disorder psychopathology, assessed using the Italian version of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE.170D) [], was characterized by overvaluation of eating control, severe dietary restriction, and excessive exercising (about 4 to 5 hours of walking) so as to interfere with weight gain. The patient reported a persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of her current low body weight and no episodes of binge eating or purging behaviours (i.e., self-induced vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse) over the past three months. Her EDE global score was 1.83, which is slightly higher than 1 standard deviation (SD) above the community mean (i.e., above 1.74) [].\nLaboratory tests at admission, before refeeding commenced, showed marked reductions in natremia (123 mEq/L; normal range 136–144 mEq/L) and chloremia (89 mEq/L; normal range 101–111 mEq/L) and very high values of serum creatine kinase (3,238 IU/L; normal values: 38–234 IU/L). In association with the high serum creatine kinase levels, the patient also reported generalised skeletal pain, which was judged to be compatible with muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis due to excessive exercising.\nAt physical examination, the patient displayed no clinical signs of dehydration or distress (i.e., neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, etc.) and neither her blood pressure nor her pulse rate increased when passing from a clinostatic to an orthostatic position. This, in association with her normal blood haemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, total protein, urea nitrogen, and creatinine values and the absence of reported self-induced vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse, was taken as indicative of nonhypovolemic hyponatremia []. Her urine specific gravity (1.011; normal range 1.005–1.030) was within the normal range and the serum osmolality (256 mOsm/kgH2O; normal range 275–295 mOsm/kg) was suggestive of the diagnosis of hypoosmolar hyponatremia [].\nThe medical team judged the patient to be at a high risk of severe complications (i.e., cerebral and pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure) of hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis secondary to excessive exercising, concluding that the best treatment option was inpatient CBT-E to address the patient's eating disorder psychopathology, including her excessive exercising, with some minor adaptations to treat the associated medical comorbidity.\nIn brief, inpatient CBT-E, described in detail elsewhere, has four main goals [, ]: (i) to engage the patient in treatment and change; (ii) to remove the eating disorder psychopathology; (iii) to correct the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the psychopathology; and (iv) to ensure the changes brought about are lasting. In this specific case, a major focus of the first part of the treatment was to help the patient to see the need to interrupt her excessive exercising, accept rest, and avoid movement, a strategy that would simultaneously manage her eating disorder psychopathology, rhabdomyolysis, and exercise-associated hyponatremia. To encourage the patient to make the decision to interrupt excessive exercising herself (rather than have it imposed on her), a fundamental principle of CBT-E, the patient was educated about the adverse effect of excessive exercising. We informed her that such behaviour was a potent maintenance mechanism of her eating disorder psychopathology [] and current conditions, interfering with weight regain, likely underlying her muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis [], and hyponatremia [], and potentially causing overuse injuries, fractures, and adverse cardiac events, not to mention taking up time that could be used in other, more positive ways (e.g., doing enjoyable things with others).\nAs part of the engagement process, the patient was then involved in drawing up a personalized formulation including the main expressions of her eating disorder psychopathology (i.e., overvaluation of eating control, strict diet, excessive exercising, and low body weight) and the main mechanisms maintaining them. We then discussed with her the implications of the formulation on her treatment, the effects of her overvaluation of eating control, dietary restriction, and weight regain, and, in particular, the need for immediate interruption of exercising for skeletal healing and normalising exercise-associated hyponatremia. The patient was then assisted in creating a table outlining the “Pros and Cons of Change” and evaluating her reasons for and against excessive exercising. Since the patient remained reluctant to rest, we suggest that she try to stop exercising on a trial basis, which she voluntarily agreed to do, adopting a more collaborative approach. A similar procedure, described in detail in previous publications [, ], was used to help the patient to see her low weight as a problem and make the decision to address weight regain.\nIn order to manage her acute medical conditions, the patient was offered a two-week protocol that included the following strategies and procedures:Careful supervised water restriction (1.5 litres per day) to manage the euvolemic hyponatremia. The patient agreed to drink 500 mL water three times a day under a nurse's supervision and to refrain from drinking any more []. Vitamin-B complex supplements to be prescribed for 21 days from the start of feeding to reduce the possibility of Wernicke's encephalopathy [] as a consequence of refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia. Specific cognitive and behavioural procedures strategies to address the patient's excessive exercising, focusing on promoting rest, movement avoidance, and resisting the urge to exercise. These included real-time self-monitoring of the urge to exercise, considering the impulse to exercise as a tolerable temporary phenomenon and undertaking distracting activities with others. The patient was also encouraged to move only when necessary, in order to promote skeletal muscle healing and normalisation of the exercise-associated hyponatremia. Daily physical activity was monitored objectively by means of a SenseWear armband []. A diet plan of 1500 kcal for the first week and then 2000 kcal in the second week, implemented as agreed upon with the patient, who had been informed that adequate caloric intake is highly recommended in muscle injury to promote healing and adequate solute repletion (sodium and protein) []. Daily clinical examinations and regular laboratory tests (2-3 days), conducted during the first two weeks of feeding () to monitor for refeeding syndrome and the potential onset of severe manifestations such as cerebral and/or pulmonary oedema and/or acute renal failure.\nThe patient was compliant with the protocol, which brought about a rapid improvement in her clinical conditions. Indeed, after only 48 hours, CK levels had been reduced by almost 50% and these normalised within eight days (). This prevented the occurrence of acute renal failure and was accompanied by the remission of muscle pain (). Laboratory tests also showed a gradual increase in serum sodium levels, which rose to normal levels in about 15 days (), thereby preventing the onset of severe hyponatremia-related complications (). The patient, despite being extremely underweight, did not develop any signs of refeeding syndrome ().\nHaving completed the 13 weeks of inpatient therapy followed by 7 weeks of partial hospitalization, the patient was discharged on 11 May 2016 with a body weight of 48 kg, a BMI of 19.0 kg/m2, and a global EDE score of 0.48, which is less than 1 SD above the community mean (i.e., below 1.74) []. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).\nThe patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.\nThe patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.\nThe patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).

The other two siblings are completely healthy and there is no family history of genetic disease. The mother is healthy and became pregnant at age 23. There were no complications during the pregnancy. She was positive for group B streptococcus and was adequately treated with antibiotics. The child is a product of full-term pregnancy, delivered through emergent cesarean section due to meconium-stained amniotic fluid and fetal distress. His Apgar score was nine at one minute and nine at five minutes. 3.1 kg (25th percentile), 49 cm (25th percentile), and 34 cm (25th percentile) are the weight, length, and head circumference measurements at birth, respectively. On initial examination, it showed dysmorphic features like deep-seated eyes, small palpebral fissure, low set of ears, high arched palate, short neck, and right-hand polydactyly. The patient was hypertonic on all four limbs. At 12 hours of life, precordial examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border. On pulmonary auscultation, he was ventilated on Assist-Control mode with equal bilateral air entry and no pathological sounds. Abdominal examination revealed umbilical hernia which resolved at seven months of age without any intervention, and normal male genitalia with both testicles present in the scrotum. Chromosomal analysis performed on a cultured peripheral blood sample revealed a mosaic result. Five cells showed an additional chromosome 13 (47, XY, +13). Another five cells showed numerical and structural normal male chromosomes (46, XY).\nThe patient stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a month because of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, pericardial effusion, and respiratory distress. He was treated with polycose and diazoxide, and the goal was to maintain blood glucose level as 5-6 mmol/L. The pericardial effusion resolved on its own and did not need pericardiocentesis. Intubation was performed for respiratory distress because of worsening oxygen saturation. During his stay in the NICU, he was followed up by endocrinology and cardiology. Head and abdominal ultrasounds were normal and chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram showed patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, both closed by themselves. Patent ductus arteriosus closed few days after birth and the patent foramen ovale closed at the age of nine months. MRI of the brain done on the 12th day of life showed no evidence of structural malformation and no masses or collections. At 15 months of age, he was referred to plastic surgery for removal of the postaxial polydactyly in the right hand.\nThe patient is currently being followed by a pediatrician for his asthma which is under control. At the age of 12 months, he presented to the emergency room (ER) for bronchopneumonia with hyperactive airway disease exacerbation. His hyperactive airway disease was controlled since. He is on salbutamol, taken as needed, and fluticasone 50 mcg twice daily with no day or night symptoms, no exercise-induced symptoms, and no ER visits. He used to follow with endocrinology for transient congenital hyperinsulinemia and he was on diazoxide. It resolved at the age of 18 months. Currently, he is being followed by otolaryngology because of snoring. Prescribed mometasone with the possibility of surgical removal of adenoid hypertrophy if not improved with medication.\nAt the age of two months, he was active, moving all four limbs, mildly holding his head. At age of seven months he was able to sit by himself. At 12 months he was able to cruise around furniture, holds a bottle, and say mama and dada. He was referred to physiotherapy because of balance issues when standing and walking, he showed poor knee control with partial flexion and bowing. According to the mother, his balance issues improved with physiotherapy sessions. At 15 months, he was able to get objects from the floor while standing without losing control and walk a long distance with no support. At 25 months, he was able to say multiple words but unable to form a sentence, he could run and climb up and down the stairs with on and off-balance issues. At four years and five months, he began care with developmental pediatric clinic. They have noticed that his motor activity improved with physical therapy, and he still used single words and no phrases, did not know body parts, was good with non-verbal expression, responds to name, and follows commands. He was noted to be a risk-taker with no sense of danger. The developmental pediatrician assessed his speech and motor skills to be at the level of a two-year-old child. At the age of six years, he continued to make slow progress and he gained new skills like using two to three words phrases and knows some colors and numbers.

    "problem": "<Context> An 83-year-old man was admitted to our unit for rapidly worsening renal function 3 weeks following angioplasty of the left internal carotid artery. During this 3-week period his serum creatinine increased from 2.0 to 5.4 mg/dl. The patient had suffered from hypertension within the last 20 years and had chronic kidney disease with unremarkable urinalysis and diffuse peripheral vasculopathy. At the time of admission, he was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, aspirin and rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), which was prescribed following the carotid angioplasty. At admission the patient was afebrile, eupneic and mildly hypovolemic, showed normal diuresis and had a blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg and a heart rate of 88 bpm. Laboratory tests were normal except for elevated serum creatinine (5.4 mg/dl) and BUN (73 mg/dl). Urinalysis showed no active sediment with mild proteinuria (500 mg/day). ANA, ENA, C3, C4, CH50, ANCA, cryoglobulinemia, rheumatoid factor, serum and urine protein immunofixation and free light-chain concentrations were all within the normal range. Kidney ultrasonography showed elevated echogenicity of the parenchyma and an increased renal resistance index (0.76) in the absence of renal artery stenosis. The ARB was discontinued and the patient received intravenous crystalloids for the next 72 h. At this time, the possibility of atheroembolic renal disease was excluded since the recent carotid angioplasty was performed through a femoral artery catheter, during which both an ophthalmologic examination for retinal cholesterol crystal emboli and dermatological manifestations were negative and did not show eosinophilia. However, because renal function did not recover (serum creatinine: 5.9 mg/dl), an echo-guided biopsy of the left kidney was performed. Light microscopy showed interstitial edema with lymphocyte infiltrate associated with tubulitis (fig. ). Electron microscopy evaluation was negative. Immunofluorescence was aspecific and not consistent. Based on these results, a diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis was made.\nSince rosuvastatin was the most recently introduced drug, a possible relationship between the drug and AIN was considered. Thus, rosuvastatin was withdrawn, and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was prescribed but rapidly tapered over a period of 4 weeks. The patient was discharged with conservative therapy, and after 8 weeks renal function values returned to baseline (serum creatinine 2 mg/dl, BUN 30 mg/dl, proteinuria 150 mg/24 h and urinalysis at polarized light microscopy was unremarkable).\nOne month later, the same ARB was reintroduced and, because of the high cardiovascular risk of the patient, a different statin (atorvastatin 20 mg/day) was prescribed. The patient is being regularly followed up at our outpatient service and, 6 months after the beginning of atorvastatin, has not shown any deterioration in renal functions. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

She appeared chronically ill and the findings of a physical examination of the thorax, heart, and abdomen were unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8,110/μL (neutrophils, 78.5%; and lymphocytes, 17.5%) and a hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.5 g/dL. Serum biochemical values were as follows: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; serum creatinine (Cr), 0.8 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase, 21/14 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; and amylase 2,460 U/L. Electrolyte levels were as follows: Na, 139 mmol/L; K, 4.0 mmol/L; and Cl, 102 mmol/L. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were 37.0 U/mL.\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2-cm mass near the ampulla of Vater with mild dilation of the intrahepatic and common bile ducts as well as the pancreatic ducts (). There was no evidence of invasion of other organs. Both kidneys were normal sized without apparent abnormalities.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 2-cm adenoma-like protruding lesion in the ampulla of Vater. EUS showed a well-defined isoechoic homogeneous mass without bile or pancreatic duct invasion (-). The mass was resected using a snare and a plastic stent was inserted into the bile duct; insertion of a plastic stent into the pancreatic duct failed. No specific complications, including severe bleeding or perforation, were observed (). Six hours post-procedure, the patient vomited 50 mL of blood and complained of abdominal pain. A second episode of hematemesis (<30 cc) occurred approximately 5 hours later. Immediately after the second episode, treatment with 1 g of tranexamic acid and 2 KU of hemocoagulase administered three times per day along with ceftriaxone (2 g intravenous) and a proton pump inhibitor for suspected bleeding at the resection site was initiated. Her vital signs were unremarkable. The WBC count was 7,090/μL, Hb was 10.1 g/dL, BUN was 14 mg/dL, Cr was 0.8 mg/dL, and amylase/lipase was 69/54 U/L. After the initial two episodes of hematemesis, no further hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia was observed and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. Her Hb level remained >10 g/dL. Four days after the papillectomy, the patient’s daily urine volume abruptly decreased to <100 cc and she complained of dyspnea. Her blood pressure was 103/86 mm Hg, heart rate was 134 bpm, respiratory rate was 30/minute, and body temperature was 37.0°C. Laboratory studies were as follows: Hb, 9.1 g/dL; amylase/lipase, 415/418 U/L; BUN/Cr, 73/3.9 mg/dL; and brain natriuretic peptide, 5,000 pg/mL. Venous blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH, 6.92: pCO2, 37 mm Hg; and HCO3, 7.6 mmol/L. Pulmonary edema was observed on a chest radiograph and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was performed to treat metabolic acidosis and pulmonary edema caused by acute renal failure. Although there were no signs of bleeding at that time, 2 units of packed red blood cells were transfused.\nApproximately 10 hours after the CRRT was initiated, the patient was noted to have melena mixed with a small amount of hematochezia. Melena continued to occur 2–3 times/day with a total daily volume of 200–400 cc. Her vital signs were relatively stable: blood pressure, 120–175/65–100 mm Hg; heart rate, 90–120 bpm; respiratory rate, 20–25/minute; and body temperature, 36.0°C–37.8°C. The daily serum Hb level was 7.1–9.5 g/dL and the tranexamic acid with hemocoagulase were continued. The patient received a total of 13.5 g of tranexamic acid and 36 KU of hemocoagulase and received three additional units of packed red blood cells until the sixth day post-procedure, when no further signs of bleeding were observed. However, her daily urine output was nearly zero despite the CRRT. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan was performed on day 12 to assess the cause of her anuric acute renal failure and showed normal-sized kidneys with enhancement of the renal medulla but not of the renal cortex, a finding consistent with acute RCN (). Histopathology revealed a villotubular high-grade adenoma with clear resection margins. Conventional hemodialysis was continued, but renal function did not improve and the oliguria persisted post-discharge.

    "Lower Limit": "1.008",
    "Upper Limit": "1.114",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 139.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 139.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 139.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 102.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 102.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 102.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 102.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 102.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 7.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 7.6 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 7.6 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 7.6 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 7.6 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 7.6 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 7.6 mEq/L) = 29.4 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.4 mEq/L. Plugging in 29.4 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 29.4 - 12 = 17.4 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 17.4 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 17.4 mEq/L / 16.4 mEq/L = 1.061. The patient's delta ratio is 1.061.",

She had not taken any medications prior to the emergence of symptoms. She had climbed a mountain about two weeks prior to our hospital admission and had no memory of insect or tick bite. The patient was admitted to another hospital due to fever after 7 days of climbing. She had a fever with a maximum temperature of 39 °C, aggravating nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal CT revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital seven days after the onset of symptoms. The patient was alert with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse of 84 beats/min, and body temperature of 37.6 °C on admission. Physical examination revealed no palpable lymph nodes, and there were mild macular rashes on the trunk and both thighs but no eschar. The patient stated that the skin lesions tended to improve 1–2 days before admission. Mild tenderness of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen was noted.

She had increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The blood test findings are shown in .\nBased on the patient’s outdoor activity history and laboratory findings, an SFTSV infection or other tick-borne diseases were suspected. Since SFTSV infection and other tick-borne diseases cannot be differentiated based on clinical characteristics alone, and the relevant serological test results take time, ciprofloxacin (400 mg intravenously twice a day) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day) were administered empirically while waiting for the test results (). The patient’s fever and vomiting gradually improved, and the white blood cell and platelet counts approached normal levels. Since the patient’s LDH remained elevated, she underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT on the eighth hospitalization day to exclude other malignant lymphomas. She had increased FDG uptake by the lymph nodes, including the neck, left axilla, and left supraclavicular lymph nodes (a,b). The 18F-FDG PET/CT results of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the lymph nodes were as follows: left level III lymph node (SUVmax; 4.4), left level IV (SUVmax; 8.2), left level V (SUVmax; 5.2), left supraclavicular area (SUVmax; 10.0), and left axillary lymph node (SUVmax; 25.3). Additional evaluation was conducted to exclude lymphoma secondary to enlarged axillary lymph nodes due to a high SUVmax value on 18F-FDG PET/CT. A core needle biopsy of lymph nodes was also performed to exclude lymphoma. The real-time RT-PCR targeting the M and S segments of SFTSV in the blood was positive on the same day. On pathologic examination, the left axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes exhibited extensive necrosis with atypical lymphoid hyperplasia (). These findings were similar to those of Kikuchi disease. There were no immunohistochemical staining findings suggestive of lymphoma.\nAs the prevalence of tick-borne infectious diseases such as Q fever, brucellosis, anaplasmosis and Lyme disease is low in South Korea [], these were not considered during initial evaluation. Additional tests for Q fever and brucellosis were planned in cases where the patient’s clinical symptoms did not improve or the initial tests could not demonstrate any significant results. However, the results of SFTSV real-time RT-PCR on blood samples were confirmed to be positive in this case, and the patient’s condition gradually improved without steroids or antiviral agents. She was therefore discharged without further evaluation on hospital day 14.\nThe axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes were of a normal size on CT one month later (a,b). She was clinically diagnosed with necrotizing lymphadenitis caused by SFTSV. SFTSV-PCR was performed on the remaining lymphoid tissue and the test was negative. However, the tissue sample was expectedly insufficient. In this case, the patient’s 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and necrotizing lymphadenitis mimicked malignant lymphoma.

He had difficulties in swallowing and eating; did not have melena, epigastralgia, or hematemesis; and had a history of hypertension and no known allergies. At the time of admission, he was taking at lansoprazole 15 mg/day and olmesartan medoxomil 10 mg/day. He did not drink alcohol but used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day for 45 years. His environmental and employment histories were unremarkable. His family history was remarkable for colon cancer in his father and lung cancer in his brother. On admission, his height was 161 cm, body weight was 56.5 kg, blood pressure was 126/62 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, temperature was 36.9 °C, and oxygen saturation was 98% while he was breathing ambient air. His conjunctiva was not icteric but slightly anemic. On chest examination, his heart rhythm was regular with no murmur, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. His abdomen was soft, not distended, and not tender. A soft and movable mass was palpable around the epigastrium. The legs and feet showed no edema. Laboratory tests showed a creatinine level of 0.89 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen level of 12.6 mg/dl, total bilirubin level of 0.3 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase level of 17 IU/L, and alanine transaminase level of 19 IU/L. The patient’s white blood cell count was 8930 per cubic milliliter, hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dl, and platelet count was 438,000 per cubic milliliter. An esophagogastric fiber (EGF) showed type 3 gastric carcinoma in the antrum. The tumor caused pyloric stenosis and invasion to the duodenum, so the patient was admitted to the hospital (Fig. a–c). Staging laparoscopy was performed to assess the extent of tumor spread, and laparoscopic bypass was performed. Staging laparoscopy revealed peritoneal dissemination, and peritoneal lavage cytology revealed tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. We diagnosed L, type 3, circ, cT4a(SE), cNx, pP1, pCY1, M0, stage IV (the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma). The patient was initially treated with docetaxel 40 mg/m2 on day 1, cisplatin (CDDP) 60 mg/m2 on day 1, and TS-1 120 mg/day on days 1–14, followed by a 2-week recovery period (DCS regimen). Dexamethasone 9.9 mg and palonosetron 0.75 mg were administered on day 1, and dexamethasone 6.6 mg was administered on days 2 and 3 as premedication. The patient had grade 3 diarrhea (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria) after one course (Fig. a, b). Then TS-1 was reduced (100 mg). After two courses of the DCS regimen, EGF and computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor had shrunk (Fig. c–e), and then staging laparoscopy was performed to evaluate a response. Peritoneal dissemination disappeared, and peritoneal lavage cytology revealed no tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. Then salvage operation, laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ dissection, was performed. Pathological findings were ypT2(MP), ypN2(3/15), ypP0, ypCY0, M0, ystage II (Fig. ). TS-1100 mg/day on days 1–14, every 3 weeks was started as adjuvant chemotherapy. After 15 months, CT revealed multiple peritoneal nodules (Fig. a). They were highly suspected as a recurrence. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 was started as a second regimen. Dexamethasone 6.6 mg, famotidine 20 mg, and granisetron 3 mg were administered on days 1, 8, and 15 as premedication. This regimen achieved partial response (Fig. b), but its efficacy did not last. After 3 months, CT revealed progressive disease (Fig. c). The original gastric carcinoma was HER2-positive (Fig. ). The patient’s Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 2; his body weight was 50.7 kg; and he complained of appetite loss. We concluded that the patient could not tolerate doublet therapy. Therefore, TS-1100 mg on days 1–14 with Herceptin 6 mg/kg (Roche/Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) on day 1 every 3 weeks was introduced. This regimen was substantially effective and achieved CR after 9 months based on CT findings (Fig. d, e). The patient had no adverse effects while receiving this regimen (Fig. a, b). Since then, the patient has been treated with only Herceptin 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks without any side effects, and no radiological findings of recurrence had yet occurred for 6 years, 7 months after surgery (Fig. f). </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

The thoracoscopic operation time was 299 min, and blood loss was 20 ml. During lymph node dissection around the right RLN, an unusual blood vessel was found running along the right subclavian artery (RSA). We assumed that the blood vessel was the RVA, which was very long at 7.02 cm (Fig. ). Because this anatomical abnormality was clarified, we could recognize that the right RLN coursed around the RVA and the RSA and thus was running in a larger arch than usual.

She had complaints of increasing shortness of breath, orthopnoea, fatigue and generalized pruritus. Her complaints also included daytime sleepiness, sudden awakening at night without witnessed apnoea. She had been on haemodialysis three times weekly for 3 years. At admission, she appeared non-distressed, blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, heart rate was regular 78 bpm, she was afebrile and had 3/6 systolic ejection murmur on mitral region. There were diminished breath sounds at the lung bases; she had pedal oedema +/+ bilaterally. She had 5 kg above her dry weight. Thyroid gland was normally palpable. The urine output was ∼100 ml/day.\nInitial biochemistry revealed BUN: 117 mg/dl, Cre: 5.9 mg/dl, Na: 141 mEq/l, K: 3.3 mg/dl, Cl: 83 mEq/l, albumin: 2.9 g/dl, TSH: 29.3 mU/l and free T4: 0.54 pmol/ dl. On complete blood count, haemoglobin was 9.7 g/dl, WBC 8700/mm3 and platelets 160 000/mm3. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH: 7.637, HCO3: 45 mmol/l, PaCO2: 43 mmHg, PaO2: 53 mmHg and oxygene saturation: 93%.\nHer medications included insulin glargine, l-thyroxine, quetiapine, sertralin, enalapril, furosemid and bisoprolol.\nThe patient had severe metabolic alkalosis. However, there were no conditions that could lead to metabolic alkalosis, i.e. vomiting, nasogastric suction or alkali administration. On further inquiry, she revealed that she had been taking baking soda occasionally for ∼6 years in order to relieve dyspepsia. During the last month, she increased the amount of ingestion to 4–5 packs per day due to severe dyspeptic complaints. She underwent upper endoscopy for dyspeptic complaints a few months prior to current admission, and the procedure revealed chronic gastritis.\nWe attributed the presence of metabolic alkalosis to oral alkali intake, because she did not have sufficient renal function to excrete excess alkali load. She was not hospitalized previously for any reason at our institution, and routine ABG analysis was not done at her dialysis centre. Thus, we do not exactly know her acid–base status prior to this admission. We performed haemodialysis with a haemodialysis solution whose bicarbonate concentration was 8 mEq/l below standard bicarbonate value, i.e. 26 mEq/l. We also monitored ABG values. After three consecutive haemodialysis sessions with this bicarbonate value, subsequent ABG analysis revealed pH: 7.338, HCO3: 19 mmol/l, PaCO2: 37 mmHg and PaO2: 74 mmHg. l-thyroxine dose was increased to attain euthyroid state.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 83.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 45.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 45.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 45.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 45.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 45.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 45.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (83.0 mEq/L + 45.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 13.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 13.0 - 12 = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 1.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 1.0 mEq/L / -21.0 mEq/L = -0.0476. The patient's delta ratio is -0.0476.",

Due to Crohn's disease and liver dysfunction, the patient was scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to treat acute cholecystitis. It was decided to perform the operation with thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) due to severely impaired liver function and hematologic problems. The patient had been diagnosed as having Crohn's colitis ten years prior to our clinic admission, following several episodes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The diagnosis had been confirmed by radiology, endoscopic examination and biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract. Azathioprine was also used for treatment of Crohn's disease.

She had normal physiological development during her infancy and childhood, and also has a normal sexual life with no other medical history. Her menarche was at 18 years old, and her menopause at age of 56. She had a normal menstrual history before menopause and had no postmenopausal bleeding. She had two healthy children and no miscarriages. She denied taking estrogen, progesterone or health care products. There are no similar patients in her family.\nOn physical examination, she was 153 cm tall and weighed 53 kg with body mass index of 22.6 kg/m2. Increased hair was observed in her upper lip and armpit (Ferriman- Gallwey score of 8), and a physical examination of genital revealed clitoromegaly. There was no acne, deepening of the voice or other virilization signs. Findings on examination of the head and neck, breasts and abdomen were unremarkable. She had no signs of Cushing syndrome, or acanthosis nigricans syndrome.\nThe hormonal test showed high total testosterone levels (714.8 ng/dL, reference value 14–56). Serum DHEAS (145.8 ng/mL, reference value 25.9–460.2), androstenedione (2.4 ng/mL, reference value 0.3–3.3) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (1.7 nmol/l, reference value 0–11.5) levels were within normal range. The serum values of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin were also within the normal range for the menopause. The levels of anti-mullerian hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), plasma renin activity and aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, 24-h urinary free cortisol, and 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test were in normal range. The ovarian tumor markers (Ca 125, CEA, Ca 199) were in normal reference range. The repeated samples confirmed that her high testosterone levels were within the tumor range. We excluded overt Cushing Syndrome on the basis of normal cortisol suppression after 1 mg dexamethasone and normal urinary free cortisol levels, as recently proposed by Ceccato F []. Then a middle dosage dexamethasone test (0.75 mg, 4 times a day for 5 consecutive days) without testosterone inhibition strongly suggested the potential androgen-producing tumor, further examinations were needed to distinguish ovarian or adrenal origin of hyperandrogenemia.\nInitially, the lack of co-secretion of DHEAS and androstenedione indicated that her elevated testosterone might be of ovarian origin. However, pelvic ultrasound disclosed that there was no ovarian mass, while adrenal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule in the left adrenal gland. Further pelvic magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed submucous myoma of uterus, but no abnormal of ovarian, and adrenal CT scan was also performed and a left adrenal mass of about 1.5 cm in diameter was revealed (Fig. a and b). PET-CT confirmed a round nodule in the external branch of the left adrenal gland with slight increase in FDG metabolism (the SUV max of the nodule was 2.56), considering the possibility of benign adenoma. No ovarian abnormalities or other ectopic tumors were found by PET-CT.\nBased on the clinical characteristics, hormone detection and imaging appearances of the case, pure testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent a laparoscopic resection of left adrenal tumor. Histological examination (Fig. a) and immunohistochemistry also confirmed the diagnosis of benign adrenocortical adenoma with immunohistochemistry positive for inhibin α, melan A, β-captenin (Fig. b-d), SYN (focal), Ki-67 (< 3%), and negative for chromogranin (CgA), cytokeratin (CK), S-100, P53. The level of testosterone decreased to 15.8 ng/dl on the 3rd day after operation, and the symptoms of virilization were alleviated during the follow-up, which further confirms the adrenal etiology of the testosterone production. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Initial neurological examination revealed global aphasia with right-sided hemiparesis. He was noted to be incontinent of urine.\nHis medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His medications included warfarin, tamsulosin, seretide, felodipine and candesartan. He has no physical disability, independent prior to hospital admission. On presentation, he was hemodynamically stable with a GCS of 11/15 (E4/V1/M6). Initial blood parameters including inflammatory markers were within normal limits. Each episode of seizures lasted less than a minute. They were all self-terminating. He was commenced on phenytoin infusion. CT brain revealed an old lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia. He was transferred to the stroke ward for further observation and treatment. It was noted he had been developing further seizure clusters despite IV phenytoin. Each seizure episode lasted between 3 and 5 min. Nursing documentation revealed at least 20 stereotypical movements within the first 24 h.\nOn the second day of his admission, his CRP had risen and he was commenced treatment for aspiration pneumonia. MRI brain was unremarkable with no evidence of temporal or meningeal enhancement (). Lumbar puncture was delayed in view of his abnormal INR. His random blood sugar measurement was recorded at 30 mmol/L with HbA1c measurement of 14.8%. He was commenced on IV insulin with subsequent reduction of seizure frequency. He was seizure free within 24 h and discharged uneventfully with oral metformin.

    "problem": "<Context> A 77-year-old man presented with a complaint of a lump on the upper abdominal wall for several weeks. His performance status (PS) was Grade 2 (Height, 168 cm; Weight, 58 kg; BMI, 20 kg/m2). He had a history of appendicitis that was operated upon. On physical examination, the tumor was located on the upper left side of the abdominal wall measuring around 5 cm with poor mobility and partial ulceration but without pain (Fig. ). At a nearby hospital, he had previously undergone physical examination and computed tomography (CT) for his symptoms. Advanced gastric cancer with invasion to the skin of the abdominal wall was suspected and, for more specific investigation and therapy, he was referred to our department. We obtained informed consent from all participants, and all procedures therapy were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nHis blood investigation revealed the following: hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 6,060 /μL, platelets 321,000 /μL, prothrombin time-international nomarized ratio (PT-INR) 1.05, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chlorine 105 mmol/L, creatinine 0.91 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 13 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 10 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 249 U/L, γ-guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (γ-GTP) 14 U/L, LD 156 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 0.41 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen-S (CEA-S) 1.6 ng/mL, alpha-fetoprotein 1.83 ng/mL and carbohydorate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) <2 U/mL. There was moderate anemia but there was no organ failure and or elevation of tumor marker.\nOn Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a Type 3 tumor that measured around 40 mm was observed occupying from the angle of the stomach to the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach (Fig. ).\nOn biopsy, the histological type was revealed as tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1) and immunostaining for HER2 was negative.\nThoracoabdominal enhanced CT revealed invasion of the tumor from the anterior wall of the stomach to the lateral region of the liver and infiltration from the abdominal wall to the skin. There was no evidence of metastasis or ascites (Fig. ).\nOn the basis of these findings, we diagnosed advanced gastric cancer (L-Less, Gre, type 3, 40 mm, tub1), cT4b (SI; liver, skin) N0M0 c Stage IIIA. Initially we anticipated chemotherapy considering that the patient's PS was Grade 2 and the defect of abdominal wall was too large for surgery. In addition, the patient did not want to undergo surgery. S-1+Cisplatin (SP) therapy was performed as first-line therapy every 3 weeks [].\nObvious shrinkage of the tumor invasion to the skin was observed, and we determined that PR was obtained at the end-point of 4th course of SP therapy. However, because of malaise (Grade 2), we had to set a 1-month interval. During the interval, the invasion to the skin gradually increased again; hence, another two courses of SP regimen were added with decreased dose. After six courses of SP therapy had been completed, PR was obtained again by the re-shrinkage of the skin tumor on physical examination and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT (Fig. , ). At this point, the patient was not amenable to surgery or chemotherapy; hence, we adopted a “wait-and-see” approach. During this period, the skin tumor underwent re-growth gradually for which RAM/PTX therapy (3-week administration at 1-week intervals) was introduced as the second line chemotherapy, 2 months after the previous one []. Over the course of therapy, anemia (Grade 3) and neutropenia (Grade 2) were observed and we were compelled to skip one administration each of PTX in course 2 and 3but RAM dosage was completely administrated through all five courses (Fig. ). Throughout the second line of therapy, the skin tumor kept decreasing visually and enhanced abdominal CT revealed the shrinkage of the primary tumor and the invasion to the lateral area of the liver and skin. Similar findings were observed on gastrointestinal endoscopy; and hence, we determined that PR was obtained again (Fig. ). Since his general condition was observed have improved, we planned to perform surgery with the aim of reaching a chemotherapy-free status.\nWe performed open total gastrectomy with D2 lymph nodes dissection (Roux-en-Y reconstruction) with combined partial resection of the skin, abdominal wall, and liver. There were no findings of the peritoneal dissemination, metastasis to the liver, or ascites (Fig. ). The components separation method was performed for abdominal wall closure with the defect of the skin by exposure of the anterior sheath of abdominal rectal muscles and resection of partial aponeurosis of the right external abdominal oblique muscle. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "52.981",
    "Upper Limit": "58.557",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 77 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 0.91 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 58.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 58.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 20.55 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.6, indicating they are normal weight. Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 58.0 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 77) * 58.0 * 1) / (0.91 * 72) = 55.769 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 55.769 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 29-year-old man presented at a emergency room in a stupor.\nThe patient had started psychiatric treatment after being diagnosed with personality disorder and hypochondriasis by the department of psychiatry in our hospital 4 years ago. After about 1 year of treatment, olanzapine was administered due to the patient's symptoms of social withdrawal and distrust of people. After the initiation of olanzapine, the patient's body weight increased by ≥30 kg, and hyperthermia occurred together with nausea and vomiting 1 week prior to the visit to our hospital. The patient received a prescription from a neighboring hospital and had taken antipyretics, but did not show any improvement. Then the patient showed mental deterioration and was admitted to our hospital via the emergency room.\nBoth parents were moderately built, and none of the family members, including siblings, had a metabolic disease such as diabetes.\nThe patient was on medication due to incidences of personality disorder, hypochondriasis, and psychotic tendency, taking olanzapine 10 mg, valproic acid 500 mg, clonazepam 0.5 mg, and lorazepam 1 mg on a daily basis. The aforementioned medication regimen was maintained for over 1 year without any dosage change, and the intake period of olanzapine was 32 months. There was no other underlying disease than the aforementioned, and there were no abnormal test results based on blood assay, including an assay for fasting plasma glucose, which was performed prior to administration of antipsychotics.\nThe patient had no history of smoking or alcohol drinking and was unemployed since completion of military service as social service personnel.\nIn physical examination, the patient showed acute signs of illness and was in a coma. His vital signs measured at the time of visit to our hospital were 110/70 mm Hg for blood pressure (BP), 120 beats per minute for pulse rate, 24 times per minute for respiratory rate, and 37.2℃ for body temperature. The patient's height was 181 cm, weight was 104 kg and body mass index (BMI) was 31.7 kg/m2. His consciousness state was stupor with normal light reflexes, and senses as well as spontaneous motions of extremities were maintained. Chest auscultation revealed that the heart rate was fast, but there was no murmur, and the patient had tachypnea, but had no crackles or wheezing sound auscultated. There was neither notable tenderness nor rebound tenderness from the abdomen. The patient's skin was dry overall.\nPeripheral blood assay showed the following results: white blood cell 6,560/mm3 (neutrophil 72%), hemoglobin 20.2 g/dL, hematocrit 60.8%, and platelets 228,000/mm3. Taking the findings of physical examination into account, dehydration-induced hemoconcentration was suspected. The results of serum biochemical assay revealed that the plasma glucose level had increased to 1,216 mg/dL, the blood urea nitrogen level was 31 mg/dL, and creatinine level was 2.4 mg/dL. The result also showed the following: sodium, 149 mEq/L; potassium, 4.5 mEq/L; chloride, 96 mEq/L; total protein, 8.7 g/dL; albumin, 5.0 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 28 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 44 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; calcium, 11.5 mg/dL; phosphate, 6.1 mg/dL; and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 80 U/L (reference range, 30 to 170). Dipstick-utilized urine assay showed a positive reaction to ketone, and increases in amylase and lipase to 545 IU/L (reference range, 28 to 100) and 1,435 U/L (reference range, 13 to 60), respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed that the pH was 7.25, pCO2 was 18.9 mm Hg, pO2 was 86.1 mm Hg, HCO3- was 8.2 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation was 95.7%, presenting metabolic acidosis with 44.8 mEq/L of anion gap. The glycosylated hemoglobin level was 13.8%, while the serum C-peptide level tested during the administration of insulin were 0.38 ng/mL. So the patient was presumed to be in DKA and acute renal failure.\nElectrocardiography findings showed sinus tachycardia with rate of 150 beats per minute.\nThere were no specific findings from the chest X-ray examination, and there was no evidence of ileus other than fecal impaction shown on abdominal X-ray examination. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed no findings of edema or necrosis or fluid retention in the pancreatic parenchyme and its periphery ().\nAlthough there was no sign of BP reduction, the patient showed severe dehydration induced by extreme hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. We administered ≥4 L per day of fluid through intravenous infusion and immediately began insulin pump therapy. Within 24 hours of insulin therapy, the plasma glucose level was reduced to less than 300 mg/dL (), the anion gap level was reduced to normal range and ABGA showed that the patient was out of metabolic acidosis. But, in spite of fluid infusion of ≥2 L per day, hyperthermia occurred and the levels of CPK and creatinine began to increase rapidly to 16,161 U/L and 4.1 mg/dL, respectively, on the 3rd day of hospitalization. Also, the urinary myoglobin level was 1,879 ng/mL. In addition, the patient was in a confused mental state with severe muscle stiffness and rigidity, and increased uptake at upper and lower proximal limb was shown on bone scan (). Even with fluid treatment for acute renal failure, the level of creatinine continued to increase, so we started continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on the 5th day of hospitalization (). After initiation of CRRT, the patient showed remarkable improvement in fever and consciousness, so we converted dialysis modality to intermittent hemodialysis 3 days later and maintained the treatment until the 12th day of hospitalization. The urine output was normalized and there was no additional elevation in creatinine and CPK concentrations, so we discontinued hemodialysis (). The patient presented consciousness deterioration, muscle stiffness, and high fever that did not respond to antipyretics and fluid infusion with history of taking antipsychotics, so we determined that the patient had NMS, and implemented supportive therapy including discontinuation of causative medication. We used the insulin pump for glycemic control in the early stage, and changed to multiple daily injections of insulin to manage the patient's condition. We could discontinue the administration of insulin on the 41st day after the first visit to our hospital as the insulin demand had gradually decreased. And we changed to metformin monotherapy. We stopped the administration of oral hypoglycemic agents on the 52nd day. On follow-up examination, we confirmed a notable reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin and a remarkable restoration of the serum C-peptide level (). Currently, the patient is maintaining very good glycemic control only by life style modification and is under prognostic observation as an outpatient. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "40.648",
    "Upper Limit": "44.926",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 149.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 96.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 8.2 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 149.0 mEq/L - (96.0 mEq/L + 8.2 mEq/L) = 44.8 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 44.8 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 5.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. Let's first convert the mass of albumin from mg to g. The mass of albumin is 5.0 mg. To convert 5.0 mg of albumin to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 5.0 mg albumin * 0.001 g/mg = 0.005 g albumin. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mg albumin/dL converts to 0.005 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 44.8 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.005 (in g/dL)) = 54.787 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 54.787 mEq/L. Plugging in 54.787 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 54.787 - 12 = 42.787 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 42.787 mEq/L.",

There was a history of cocaine and alcohol ingestion the previous evening. The exact timing of his collapsed state in relation to the cocaine ingestion was unclear. His Glasgow Coma Score on arrival was 4. He was hypoxic (oxygen saturation 80%), with a respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min, heart rate of 120 and blood pressure of 90/43. Initial management consisted of oxygen and rapid fluid infusion. He required a rapid sequence induction, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The ECG was interpreted as showing a broad complex tachycardia (). Initial blood gas showed a PaO2 8.8 KPa, PaCO2 7.52 KPa, pH 7.0 and base excess was -12 with a serum lactate of 7.2. Biochemistry revealed a serum potassium 8.9 of mmol/l, Alanine Transaminase of ~6500, Creatinine of 395, Troponin of 0.7 and creatinine kinase was unrecordably high. He was given insulin and dextrose (10 units in 50 ml 50% glucose) to treat the hyperkalemia followed by synchronized cardioversion (50 J, 100 J × 2) in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm. He remained hypotensive and was therefore commenced on a dobutamine infusion in the emergency department. Initial echocardiogram revealed severe systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%. Because of the high risk of coronary vasospasm from cocaine and a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease he was taken for urgent coronary angiography. However the coronary vasculature was normal. Computed tomography of the brain was also normal. His cardiac rhythm normalised over the next 2 hours with a sinus tachycardia once the serum potassium levels were corrected to 5.1 mmol/l (). He remained intubated and ventilated and was transferred to intensive care. His oxygenation rapidly deteriorated and a chest X-ray showed a bat’s-wing appearance of pulmonary oedema. The metabolic acidosis persisted and he was noted to be anuric. The working diagnosis was rhabdomyolysis leading to renal failure and hyperkalemia. He required prone ventilation and continuous haemofiltration. Over the next 8 days his condition slowly improved and following a tracheostomy he was successfully weaned from ventilatory support but continued to require intermittent haemodialysis. He was discharged to the ward but 2 weeks later he suffered a grand mal convulsion and was found to have bilateral basal ganglia and internal capsule infarcts possibly secondary to the cocaine ingestion. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

He was hospitalized in a rural health facility where his clinical picture was initially considered as due to prolonged seizure activity for which he received multiple anti-epileptic drugs. As he was progressively deteriorating, he was referred to a tertiary center. As per the caregiver’s description and medical records received from the previous hospital, he was having abnormal, involuntary, rapid, brief and jerky movements involving face and upper limbs (predominantly right sided). Although there was no history of headache, fever, vomiting, and any focal weakness, the patient had significant involuntary weight loss in last 4 months. Family history and drug history were non-contributory.\nClinical examination revealed the patient was drowsy, dehydrated, cachectic, afebrile, tachycardic (130/min), normotensive (100/60 mmHg) and tachypneic (36/min). He had faciobrachial myoclonic jerks with asymmetric involvement of right upper limb more than left upper limb (distal more than proximal), with tonic neck deviation to left side withoutany abnormal movement of bilateral lower limbs (). The myoclonic jerks were not associated with any external cues or voluntary action. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of upper limbs could not be assessed due to persistent abnormal involuntary movements. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of lower limbs were normal; the plantar reflexes were flexor. Complete assessment of cranial nerves, sensory, cerebellar and autonomic functions could not be done. There was no sign of meningeal irritation and papilledema.\nAcute onset multifocal myoclonus associated with encephalopathy with a background of addiction and recent onset progressive involuntary weight loss had narrowed the differential diagnoses to toxic-metabolic and neuro-infectious etiologies. Bedside CBG was measured immediately and was found to be 695 mg/dL (normal, <200). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH- 7.28 [normal, 7.35–7.45], HCO3- -18 mEq/L [normal, 22–26], Na+- 117 mEq/L [normal, 135–145] [131 mEq/L when corrected for hyperglycemia], anion gap- 18 mmol/L (normal<12), with normal serum osmolality, pO2, pCO2, K+, and ionic Ca2+). Urine examination showed glycosuria (3+) and ketonuria (2+); plasma beta-hydroxy-butyrate level was found to be 3.6mmol/L (normal, <1.5). Thus, a diagnosis of DKA was confirmed. Adequate hydration was ensured with normal saline followed by treatment with continuous intravenous regular insulin (at a rate of 8 IU/h)., Once CBG came down to less than 400 mg/dL, approximately 3 h after therapy, all movements disappeared. His metabolic derangements were completely corrected by next 2 days and CBG was fairly controlled with basal-bolus regimen.\nAfter stabilization he had absolutely normal hemodynamic and hydration status. Detailed neurological and other systemic examinations were within normal limits. His HbA1c was 10.62% (normal, <5.6), fasting and post-prandial blood glucose were 137 mg/dL (normal, <100) and 250 mg/dL (normal, <140) respectively. C peptide level was low [0.1 ng/ml (normal, 0.5–2.7)] with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65 antibodies that established the diagnosis of T1DM. The patient’s oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2, by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay, was negative.\nAll other tests of the metabolic panel (complete hemogram, lipid profile, renal, liver, thyroid function tests) were within normal limits.

She also had a history of positive hepatitis B surface antigen. A total bilirubin of 6.9 mg/dL was higher than her usual baseline. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen was unremarkable except for chronic cholecystitis (Figures , ).\nA hepatitis panel was also checked along with other viral antibodies (Table ). The findings were not consistent with a reactivation of hepatitis B infection.\nGiven the patient's significant cardiac history, a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed that revealed mildly depressed biventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction 45%-50%), prosthetic mitral valve well seated, but at least mild paravalvular insufficiency. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 55%), a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with a significant PVL and likely moderate mitral regurgitation with some pulmonary flow reversal, and no pericardial effusion (Figure ).\nCardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation secondary to multiple PVLs, and normal cardiac output/index.\nGiven these findings, hemolytic anemia was suspected. This was further evaluated with a hemolysis panel (Table ).\nThese findings were suggestive of hemolytic anemia. The differential diagnosis was of hemolysis occurring either secondary to mechanical shearing due to valvular pathology or an autoimmune etiology. Serum protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulin levels, as shown in Table , and direct Coombs test were unremarkable, eliminating autoimmune etiology as the cause for hemolysis. Cardiothoracic surgeons did a third time re-operation, a right mini-thoracotomy Heartport mitral valve re-replacement with a mechanical valve was performed without complications. A post-operative TEE demonstrated a normally functioning prosthesis with no PVL, and low normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 50%). The hyperbilirubinemia resolved, with a total bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL at discharge. Hemoglobin improved to 12.7 g/dL at the 6-month follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Onset of the pain was four days before; however, he had been experiencing other symptoms for approximately three months. He reported productive cough, pyrexia, chills, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. He denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, and rectal manipulation. Vital signs revealed temperature of 99.8°F, blood pressure 105/67 mmHg, pulse 91 bpm, respiratory rate 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation 99%. Labs revealed sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate 22 mEq/L, creatinine 0.54, WBC 9.3 k/μl, hemoglobin 11.0 g/dl, and platelet 416 k/μl.\nOn physical examination, there was palpable right lower quadrant tenderness accompanied by abdominal rigidity and involuntary guarding. The patient was not amenable to digital rectal examination due to reported pain. However, illuminated visual examination of the rectum did not reveal any abnormalities. Due to the constellation of travel history, cough, and constitutional symptoms, a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. It revealed biapical pleural thickening associated with parenchymal scarring, bronchiectasis, nodularity, and superimposed infiltrates (). Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was highly suspected, and the patient was placed in an isolation room. Further imaging was accomplished with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast. This revealed acute appendicitis in the right lower quadrant congruent with earlier physical examination findings (). It also revealed a 3.1 × 1.9 cm dumbbell-shaped loculated fluid collection anterior to the anus consistent with perirectal abscess () confirming the etiology of his rectal discomfort. Finally, CT gave more insight into suspected pulmonary TB as it revealed nodular and patchy consolidation in both lung bases along with dense consolidation, fluffy airspace infiltrates, distended, and distorted bronchi ().\nThe patient was taken to the operating room expeditiously where he underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), laparoscopic appendectomy, and incision and drainage of the perirectal abscess. By postoperative day one, cultures from BAL, sputum, and perirectal abscess were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Cultures from the perirectal abscess were also positive for beta-hemolytic group C streptococcus. Gross pathology of the appendix revealed a dusky, congested, red-brown serosa. When sectioned, we appreciated a dilated lumen measuring approximately 0.5 cm in diameter and an appendiceal wall thickness averaging at 0.3 cm. The mucosa was noted to be tan-pink, glistening, and congested. The lumen of the appendix contained abundant gray-pink semisolid contents. A discrete perforation was not appreciated. Histologic analysis revealed a focally effaced mucosa albeit where present, the epithelium was without atypia. Foci of acute and granulomatous inflammation were appreciated () along with epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells (). Initial acid-fast staining was negative, but a repeat stain revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the cytoplasm of a multinucleated giant cell ().\nThe patient was started on antitubercular drugs that included a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Based on sensitivities, he was also started on antibiotics for management of the streptococcal infection. The patient did well postoperatively and tolerated both antibacterial and antitubercular treatments without complication. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Upper Limit": "3.15",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 99.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 15.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 15.0 - 12 = 3.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 3.0 mEq/L.",

His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 147 mg/L (< 5), and white cell count (WCC) was 8.7×109/L (4 – 11×109/L). He received 5 days of meropenem for sepsis, presumed to be due to cellulitis or an infective collection, and underwent ultrafiltration with HD. A Doppler ultrasound scan (DUSS) excluded a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a collection, but demonstrated edema of the superficial tissues. Blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics were negative.\nThe patient’s continued discomfort prompted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This revealed an abnormal signal from the anterior and medial left thigh muscle compartments on T1-weighted imaging (). This, in conjunction with fat suppression through short tau inversion recovery (STIR), was reflective of an inflammatory or infective process. Orthopedic and rheumatology specialist opinions were sought; prompting an autoimmune screen (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA); all of which returned negative) and the suggestion of a muscle biopsy. However, a subsequent review by the diabetes multidisciplinary team concluded that the findings were consistent with DMN, and the biopsy was avoided. He was managed with gentle physiotherapy and oxycontin 5 mg twice a day, with another 5 mg as needed for break-through pain.

The patient had no growth chart until he came to our hospital. The patient did not gain weight as well as his monozygotic twin brother ().\nA physical examination revealed the following: pulse, 120 beats per minute; blood pressure, 140/80 mmHg; weight, 50 kg; height, 173 cm; body mass index (BMI) 16.7 kg/m2; and BMI percentile according to age, 6.1. No abnormalities in the heart, lung, abdomen, or nerve were detected. However, he presented signs of hand tremor at rest, and an enlarged thyroid gland was detected with a firm density. No eye abnormalities due to hyperthyroidism and no signs of acromegaly, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea were detected. He had normal secondary sexual characteristics, with his genitalia and pubic hair (Tanner stage 3). The patient had no history of prior thyroid disease. The monozygotic twin brother presented no clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, with a normal thyroid function test.\nThe test results revealed secondary hyperthyroidism, with elevated FT3 levels at 23.08 pmol/L, FT4 levels of 86.32 pmol/L, and TSH levels of 8.25 mUI/L. Investigations of other hormones, including cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and prolactin, showed normal results ().\nThyroid ultrasound revealed that the thyroid gland was heterogeneous, without increased vascularity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary showed a pituitary lesion with mild hyperintensity on the T2-weighted image (), which was less enhancing than the surrounding pituitary parenchyma () and measured 5 × 6 × 7 mm in size. This lesion was suspected to be a pituitary microadenoma.\nThe patient could not afford the cost of somatostatin analog; therefore, thyroid hormone levels were normalized by methimazole (20 mg per day) and propranolol (10 mg three times per day) before performing an endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor. When the patient was admitted to the hospital for surgery, he received a short-term treatment with sandostatin (0.1 mg three times a day), propylthiouracil (PTU), and propranolol. Because the patient was treated with oral methimazole 20 mg per day for 5 months and still had high serum FT4 before surgery, we switched to PTU to prevent thyroid storm during surgery. Postoperative pathology results revealed an adenoma of the pituitary gland ().\nAfter surgery, the doses of PTU and propranolol were gradually reduced. Two weeks following the operation, the patient was stabilized, PTU and propranolol were discontinued, and he was discharged from the hospital. Serum TSH and FT4 levels were evaluated and showed a decreasing tendency after treatment ().\nAfter discharge, the patient presented no clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

In the emergency department, the patient was febrile with 100.7F, blood pressure being 89/60 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, resting tachycardia to 110 beats per minute, and low oxygen saturation to 90% on room air which worsened to 86% on minimal exertion. On physical exam, the patient appeared tired, had scleral icterus, triceps wasting, dry mucous membranes, and abdominal tenderness to palpation over all quadrants, most pronounced in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant.\nComplete blood count and comprehensive panel were obtained on initial labs, which were significant for hemoglobin of seven grams per deciliter (g/dl) and borderline normocytic anemia with poikilocytosis and occasional target cells, normal leukocyte and platelet count; elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and severe hypercalcemia to 14.2 milligrams per deciliter. Given hypoxia at room air, the patient was sent for computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed submassive pulmonary embolism with extension to segmental and subsegmental vessels bilaterally. In the emergency department, the patient was given boluses of normal saline with calcitonin, zoledronic acid, therapeutic low molecular weight heparin, and oxygen delivery optimized with the nasal cannula. The patient was admitted to the medicine floor for further optimization. Given the concern of malignancy or chronic inflammatory process, CT abdomen/pelvis obtained showed large heterogenous mass extending from gallbladder's fundus and invading liver parenchyma with peripheral enhancement and central hypo-enhancement with contrast measuring 105 x 145 x 154 mm in anteroposterior and craniocaudal dimensions suggestive of a tumoral mass with extensive necrosis or liver abscess. There were also perihepatic ascites, and a satellite lesion in the left hepatic lobe measuring 12 x 13 x 15 mm noted on imaging (Figures , ).\nGiven systemic signs, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures were sent. Interventional radiology was consulted for pigtail drains, and around 300 mL output was obtained, which was sterile with no bacterial growth, serosanguineous, and exudative by nature. Biopsy was also sent from the invasive mass of the gall bladder. Antibiotics were discontinued after successive negative blood cultures, but low-grade fever persisted. MRI liver was also obtained after interval placement of pigtails to delineate the mass further, which confirmed the aforementioned findings demonstrating large centrally necrotic heterogeneous mass and nodularity along with the omentum anteriorly with soft tissue signals representing peritoneal carcinomatosis, making it metastatic carcinoma of the gall bladder. Few porta hepatis nodes were measuring up to a centimeter on the short axis (Figures , ).\nPathology results resulted in neoplastic cell proliferation with intercellular bridges and focal individual cell keratinization, with rare keratin pearls. Core biopsy did not show any glandular or hepatic parenchyma component. Immunohistochemical stains showed diffusely positive staining on neoplastic cells for p63, CK5/6, CK17, and CK19, while negative for hepatocyte, glypican-3, and arginase-1, supporting the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (Figure -D).\nGiven the current diagnosis, oncology, general surgery, and radiation oncology were taken on board. General surgery deemed the mass inoperable in this particular setting. Oncology recommended a trial of dose modified gemcitabine and cisplatin regimen versus dose reduced gemcitabine regimen for the patient. Given the severe risk of myelosuppression and the patient's attestation as Jehovah's witness and thus refusal of blood transfusion and considerable anemia below seven g/dl during the hospital course, oncological treatment was deferred.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin and antifungals were started. The patient later was hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/46 despite aggressive intravenous hydration. Due to septic shock, intravenous norepinephrine drip was started in the intensive care unit. Laboratory studies were significant for pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 2.79 x 103 cells/µL. Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\nThe infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\nTwo months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\nInitially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\nSix months later, he had a repeat CT of the chest as seen in Figure . This CT showed the presence of permanent pneumatoceles from the focal loss of lung parenchyma.\nOur patient was readmitted on several occasions mainly due to bouts of community-acquired viral pneumonia (adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza) along with a secondary Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. He did not have recurrent CA-MRSA pneumonia. His chest CT scan as seen in Figure from 2.5 years after the original MRSA infection demonstrated bronchiectasis and persistent pneumatoceles from his original infection with CA-MRSA.\nHis initial recurrent community-acquired pneumonias with secondary MRSA and his recent recurrent episodes of pseudomonas infection suggest the patient was likely chronically colonized. </Context> <Question> What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? </Question>",

The patient's heart rate is greater than or equal to 100 beats per minute, and so we increment the perc critieria met by 1, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The saturated oxygen percentage in the room is 91.0 percent. The saturated oxygen is less than 95%, and so we increment the perc critieria met by 1, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient note does not report a status on 'unilateral leg swelling'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 2. The patient note reports 'hemoptysis' to be present for the patient and so we increment the criteria count by 1, making the current total 2 + 1  =  3. The patient note reports 'recent surgery or trauma' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 3.

She stated that the symptoms initiated one day earlier with muscle cramping of the bilateral posterior thighs and had gradually progressed to an inability to walk or lift her legs. The patient initially attributed her symptoms to dehydration as she had worked several 12-h shifts in a row as a registered nurse. She reported some urinary hesitancy although denied urinary or bowel incontinence, any sensory deficits of the lower extremities, or severe headaches. The patient mentioned several stressors, including marriage in the next week to a man to whom she had been previously married, working overtime, minimal sleeping at night, and long commute to work. Past medical history was significant for anxiety, depression, and migraines. The patient denied a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Two years earlier, the patient was hospitalized for 24 h following complaints of right hemiparesis and chest pain. She was diagnosed with conversion disorder due to a psychological stressor.\nThe physical examination revealed 1/5 power in the lower extremities bilaterally, with distal strength greater than proximal. Sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle tone of the lower extremities were normal. There was an absence of atrophy or hypertrophy of the muscles, rigidity or spasticity, and tremors or abnormal movements. Serial cervical, thoracic, and lumbar MRI scans with and without gadolinium contrast demonstrated no significant stenosis, neural compression, or other etiologies of her symptoms. The brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast was normal. The initial impression was conversion disorder due to the patient's multiple work and familial stressors. She was hospitalized and treated with methylprednisolone and hydromorphone.\nA lumbar puncture and a CSF pathogen panel were performed, the latter utilizing a multiplex nested PCR followed by a melting analysis to detect nucleic acid sequences. The sensitivity was greater than 95%, and the specificity was greater than 99.6%. The panel detected HSV-2 and was negative for crypococcal antigen. The following findings were also observed in the CSF: glucose 90 mg/dL (40–70 mg/dL), protein 55 mg/dL (12–60 mg/dL), WBC 434/μL (0–5/μL), RBC 9/μL (0–2/μL), lymphocytes 94% (40–80%), and monocytes 6% (15–45%). The culture CSF/Gram stain revealed rare WBCs and no organisms, and the HIV-1 and -2 antibody/antigen combination was nonreactive. Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies (Lyme disease), syphilis total antibodies, hepatitis B core antibodies and surface antigens, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were all negative. The patient was diagnosed with radiculomyelitis due to HSV-2 marked by back pain and weakness of the lower extremities with evidence of lymphocytic pleocytosis. She initiated treatment with acyclovir 650 mg infused every 8 h for 3 weeks and was subsequently prescribed valacyclovir.\nThe patient had attained no improvement of her lower extremity pain when evaluated by a neurologist 5 and 8 months following the start of her symptoms. Additionally, CSF findings demonstrated a WBC count 6/μL, protein 33 mg/dL, and glucose 57 mg/dL 5 months after her initial lumbar puncture, respectively. There were greater than 4 oligoclonal bands detected in the CSF with no corresponding bands detected in the serum, and the IgG index was 0.9 [0.3–0.7]. These positive findings indicated an inflammatory process. The aquaporin 4 (AQP4) receptor antibody was negative. The patient was evaluated by a neurologist 17 months after her symptoms initiated, at which time she had significant improvement in the range of motion strength in her lower extremities. Her minimal residual pain was controlled with gabapentin, baclofen, and alprazolam. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mEq. To convert from 140.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 15.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 95.0 mg/dL.

    "problem": "<Context> Our patient was a 32-year-old man, coming from a country with low availability of factor replacement therapy, height 185 cm, weight 90 kg, professional driver, with severe haemophilia A (F VIII < 1%). Family history positive for severe haemophilia A (his aunt was affected). The diagnosis of severe haemophilia A occurred in his hometown during childhood because he was involved in several atraumatic intra-articular haemorrhages in the elbows, ankles and knees.\nIn March 2017, after an accidental fall skiing, he reported a blunt trauma of the right iliac wing with development of blood collection in that site.\nPelvic X-rays and bone biopsy were performed at the local hospital and osteosarcoma was excluded. In July 2017 he went to another Haemophilia Centre for the appearance of swelling, fistulisation, leakage of serum blood material and functional limitation of the right hip. He also reported an evening fever of >39°. The physical examination also revealed severe atraumatic functional limitation of the left elbow and the right ankle. Laboratory tests performed showed F VIII <1%, F VIII inhibitors: 0 BU/mL. A pelvis CT was performed, showing the presence of an abscess and a fistula at the right iliac crest (). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the culture swab, therefore antibiotic therapy with Teicoplanin + Rifampicin was introduced but subsequently suspended for gastrointestinal intolerance. The patient started prophylaxis with pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg three times a week. In June 2018, the patient was referred to our Clinic for right hip swelling, fistulisation, serum secretion, pain and functional limitation. Blood exams at the entrance showed Hb 8.6 g/dL, aPTT 40 s, F VIII 20.7% (range 70–120%), inhibitors F VIII 0 BU/mL, PCR 4.4 mg/dL (<0.5). A contrast medium pelvic CT scan demonstrated the presence, at the right iliac wing, of a large (10.1 × 14.2 × 10.7 cm) osteolytic lesion, inhomogeneous, septate and bounded by a peripheral wall of irregular thickness (6–7 mm). The lesion interrupted the cortical bone on both the posterior and anterior side of the iliac bone, also involving the sacroiliac joint plane and the sacral joint surface at S1-level. The lesion infiltrated both the gluteal muscle lodge posteriorly and the deep plane of the ileo-psoas muscle anteriorly. In addition, the presence of two subcutaneous fistulous communications was demonstrated, reaching the cutaneous plane respectively along the lateral side of the right flank and in the right paravertebral posterior lumbar region, at L5-level. Considering the patient’s medical history of haemophilia, a diagnosis of pseudotumour of the right iliac wing with an additional overlapping inflammatory-infectious complication was made.\nSurgical treatment to remove the pseudotumour was proposed and accepted by the patient.\nPd-FVIII 20 IU/Kg were administered pre-operatively as a slow intravenous bolus every 12 h for seven days before surgery.\nThe day of the surgery, the patient underwent selective embolisation with Embosphere® 500–700 of the right superficial gluteal artery and the right lumbar artery ().\nJust before the anaesthesia, pd-FVIII 50 IU/Kg was administered as a slow intravenous bolus. After that, 1 g of vancomycin was administered intravenously as intra-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. Under general anaesthesia, the patient has been placed in the lateral decubitus position. Support placed under the thorax allowed to put the patient’s pelvic area into a three-quarter anterior and posterior pelvic tilt during the intervention. Anterolateral and posterior access to the pelvis were used. The incision started along the contours of the iliac crest in a curvilinear manner and ends in the back with a vertical portion on the sacroiliac joint. The wing of the ilium and the sacrum are exposed, allowing for safety margins around the pseudotumour, which extend into the soft tissue. The iliac muscle was sectioned and detached from the endopelvic side of the ilium. The iliac vessels, ureter, lumbosacral trunk, sacral roots and sciatic nerve were identified and protected. On the exopelvic side, the gluteus muscles were moved as a unit with their fascia and skin, creating a lower myocutaneous flap.\nAfter a layered dissection of the soft tissues, we reached the pseudotumour which appeared as a voluminous brownish-red mass with a pasty-like consistency; its capsule was emptied and removed. Subsequently, the right iliac crest was custom-fit by means of a pedicle-screw and rod system (PSRS), a metal bar and two fixing screws (one in correspondence with the acetabulum and the other on the sacro-iliac synchondrosis). Dead space between the implants and the remaining bone were therefore filled by antibiotic coated bone cement with the aid of two polyglycolic acid MESH in order to build up an artificial ilium-like bony mass, as well as graft compression.\nFinally, two treble hooks were positioned for repositioning the pelvic muscles. One surgical drain was placed at the end of the surgery. Intraoperatively, a biopsy of the lesion demonstrated the presence of fibrin-haematic organised material with fragments of necro-inflammatory material and scattered microcalcifications. Swabs in fistulous passages were also performed and they showed that there was no superinfection. The patient was transfused intraoperatively with one unit of RBC\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, pd-FVIII 20 IU/Kg was administered as bolus, then pd-FVIII 20 IU/kg every 12 h on the first postoperative day; from the second post-operative day pd-FVIII 20 UI/Kg at 8 a.m. and 10 UI/Kg at 8 p.m., up to the 4th day postoperatively; from the fifth post-operative day pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg at 8 a.m. and 10 IU/Kg at 8 p.m. for two weeks, with the aim of maintaining F VIII level > 50%. Every 48 h, before the administration of concentrate of FVIII, blood was taken to check Hb, PTT and FVIII. The variations of FVIII biological activity levels during the hospital stay are summarised in . Antibiotic intravenous post-operative prophylaxis with Vancomycin 500 mg every 12 h was continued until surgical drain removal. The surgical drain was kept for 24 h and then removed with a residual volume of 300 mL of serosanguinous liquid.\nThe patient was transfused with one RBC unit the day-4, the day-6 and the day-7 after surgery owing to post-operative anaemia. A 21-days hospital stay was necessary in order to achieve a good clinical condition.\nIn the immediate post-operative period, X-ray and CT of the pelvis showed emptying of the pseudotumour and correct positioning of screws and metal cerclage (). Physiotherapy was started during hospitalisation, from day-1 after surgery and continued during the hospital stay. The patient was discharged at home with the indications for the continuation of physiotherapy, with cautious and progressive recovery of total flexion of the trunk and right thigh. Walking was allowed with aids and load pain-compatible. The patient continued replacement therapy with recombinant F VIII and analgesic therapy with paracetamol. At discharge blood exams showed Hb 8.4 g/dL, aPTT 30.7 s, FVIII 96.5%, CRP 1.3 mg/dL, ESR 109 mm/h (<10). During the rehabilitation period the patient prophylaxis scheme was pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg every other day. At the first outpatient visit, 8 days after discharge, the patient was in good general condition, he walked with aids, and the pain was well-controlled. The stitches were removed and medicated, no signs of inflammation were noted. Pelvis X-ray unchanged compared to the post-operative one. One month later the patient went to another emergency room for leakage of blood serum material from the surgical scar. A positive culture swab was found for MSSA. After two days, the patient was re-evaluated at our clinic, a wound dehiscence was observed, thus indication for wound revision was given. Five days later, the patient had a feverish episode (T 42 °C) with shaking chills and PCR increase. A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was begun and pd-FVIII 3000 IU at 8 and 1000 U at 20 was continued. Therefore, the patient was hospitalised at our Institution for wound surgical revision. Blood exams at the entrance showed Hb 10.6 g/dL, leukocytes 5.37 × 103/uL (4.00–10.00), CRP 0.97 mg/dL, ESR 85 mm/h. Preoperatively, pelvic CT was performed, and it showed a voluminous collection of infected blood fluids both on the pelvic side along the planes of the ileo-psoas muscle and on the buttock side. The fluid collection extended to the paravertebral musculature, the quadrate loin muscle, and the external oblique muscle superiorly and posteriorly. In the postero-superior site, the collection went beyond the muscle fascia and extended into the subcutaneous fat layer. Therefore, surgical toilet and abundant irrigation was performed. During the surgical procedure, swabs were carried out for culture tests, later found negative for infection. The patient was discharged with a recommendation to continue antibiotic therapy with Rifampicin and Levofloxacin for 5 days and to continue the factor VIII replacement therapy. In this second hospitalisation a 11-days hospital stay was necessary in order to achieve optimal medical condition.\nPatients were followed at outpatient clinic, at 7, 14 and 21 days. He was always in good general condition with surgical wound healed without signs of inflammation. Right hip ROM was almost complete at one month with control X-ray () unchanged than the post-operative one. At the 6- and 12-month outpatient visit the patient was in good clinical conditions, he denied disorders or functional limitations in every-day life. Currently, the patient is checked with an X-ray every 6 months.\nThe patient continued prophylaxis with pd-FVIII 30 IU/Kg three times a week.

    "problem": "<Context> An otherwise healthy 20-year-old male basic military trainee presented to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMS) with a one-day history of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient reported needing to provide a urine sample for a training program earlier in the day. Unable to provide a sample, he reportedly drank 5 to 6 liters of water until he could provide a sample. Within one hour of consumption, he became nauseated until he started vomiting and developed periumbilical/right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Additionally, he began to feel lightheaded and fatigued just prior to transportation to the ED.\nEMS was called to transport the patient to the emergency department. EMS reported initial systolic blood pressure of 70 with a diastolic of 40 without compensatory tachycardia.\nThe patient was given two liters of intravenous lactated ringers by EMS without improvement in his blood pressure. Additionally, he was found to be hypoglycemic, with serum glucose of 58 mg/dL, and given one amp of dextrose-50 by EMS. On arrival to the ED, his vital signs were notable for systolic blood pressure or 82 with a diastolic of 54 and oxygen saturation of 89% on room air improved to 95% on two liters nasal cannula. The initial point of care glucose demonstrated persistent hypoglycemia with a glucose of 71 mg/dL. An additional amp of dextrose-50 was given. Physical examination was remarkable for pale appearing lethargic young adult male with moderate diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Additionally, bibasilar crackles were appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. There were no focal neurologic deficits on examination.\nVenous blood gas was obtained upon patient arrival and was remarkable for sodium of 122 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, and magnesium of 1.5 mmol/L. In the setting of persistent hypotension unresponsive to fluids, he was given 100 mg hydrocortisone without improvement in his blood pressure. He was given one liter of normal saline over one hour after identifying his low serum sodium as a possible contributing factor to his presenting symptoms. Hypertonic saline was not given in the setting of a normal neurologic examination and concern for alternative diagnoses at the time of the identification of his low serum sodium.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and a CT chest pulmonary angiogram were obtained and notable for generalized intra-abdominal edema (Figure ), and lung imaging consistent with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Figure ). This constellation of findings is consistent with non-specific third spacing pathology.\nThe patient was in the ED for a total of four hours. The initial differential diagnosis was broad and included: sepsis, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and symptomatic hyponatremia. After completion of the evaluation in the ED, it was determined that the etiology of his presenting symptoms was acute water intoxication complicated by moderate symptomatic hyponatremia with diffuse fluid third spacing and resultant hypotension and hypoxic respiratory failure. A repeat serum sodium of 124 mmol/L was obtained four hours after the initial venous blood gas. In consultation with the intensive care unit and internal medicine service, the patient was started on a five percent dextrose (D5) normal saline drip at 1.5 times maintenance and was admitted to an intermediate care unit.\nWhile inpatient, a urine osmolality of 111 mOsm/kg was obtained, which in conjunction with urine sodium less than 20 mmol/L is consistent with the patient's hypovolemia. Additionally, a serum osmolality of 264 mOsm/kg was obtained. These lab values are consistent with the diagnosis of hypo-osmolar hyponatremia complicated by diffuse third-spacing of intravascular fluid and resultant hypovolemia.\nThe patient's electrolytes and renal function were checked every four hours during his admission. Of note, his serum sodium rose to 133 mmol/L twenty hours into his admission, and D5-water was administered to prevent further over-correction of his serum sodium. Over a twenty-four-hour period, the total increase in his serum sodium was 11 mmol/L, slightly higher than the goal increase of 6-8 mmol/L. No complications of this over-correction were observed. He was admitted for a total of three days, and after the first twenty-four hours, his serum sodium gradually normalized. His symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and lightheadedness resolved with the correction of his serum sodium.

    "problem": "<Context> A 51-year-old Caucasian male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia with LVAD placement two years prior presentation for bridge to transplantation presented with complaints of low grade fevers with concern for recurrent infection involving the LVAD line exit site (see Figure ). More than three weeks prior, he had debridement of the site and cultures grew Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus epidermidis. He underwent debridement, line repositioning and flap closure. On presentation, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. On exam, serosanguinous drainage was noted on the LVAD site dressing overlying the abdomen. His white blood cell count was 15.72 x 103/μL, hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, and creatinine 1.7 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis denoted an ill-defined high-density fluid measuring 4.4 x 5.7 cm with subtle adjacent fat stranding in the right upper and mid aspect of the abdomen, which crossed adjacent to the driveline. Thus, additional cultures were obtained with further debridement.\nAFB cultures from the LVAD exit site were notable for Mycobacterium abscessus subs. massiliense, and he was started empirically on imipenem and tigecycline intravenously, and oral azithromycin. The patient was discharged, but was subsequently readmitted due to gastrointestinal intolerance to tigecycline. As such, this was replaced by omadacycline, which he later was unable to tolerate as well. Over the next five months, the patient’s clinical status deteriorated and he had numerous readmissions. A decision was made for him to be on lifelong therapy with oral clofazamine and azithromycin (see Table ). However, his last admission to the hospital was for confusion and electrolyte disturbances for which he required urgent dialysis. His poor inpatient clinical course led to comfort care measures being instituted as per request, and he subsequently expired. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "45.795",
    "Upper Limit": "50.615",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 51 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.7/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**51 * 1.0 = 48.205. Hence, the GFR value is 48.205 ml/min/1.73 m².",

    "problem": "<Context> We report on a 32-year-old female (62 kg bodyweight) with history of paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenia and depression who was discovered by her companion in life 26 hours after ingestion of 36 g quetiapine (120 tablets of 100 mg and 80 tablets of 300 mg) and a suspected abuse of lorazepam. A previous suicide had been attempted 10 years before with haloperidol. Her past medical history was negative for cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertensive heart disease or a thyroid dysfunction. The emergency medical service found the patient comatose with response only to deep painful stimuli (Glasgow Coma Scale of 9), normotensive (127/83 mmHg), hyperglycemic capillary glucose level: 8.96 mmol/L = 160 mg/dl and tachycardiac with sinustachycardia of 140 bpm, capillary oxygen saturation was 98% and respiratory rate 12/min. There was no evidence of trauma or infection. During the transport to the hospital 40 mg of furosemide and 1000 mL saline were administered intravenously for detoxification and prophylaxis of hypotension. Vital signs were stable during transport.\nOn admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) the patient's condition worsened and she was intubated for airway protection. At this time venous blood gas on 30% FiO2 revealed pH of 7.38, pO2 of 45.3 mmHg, pCO2 42.2 mmHg, HCO3\n− 24.4 mmol/L, base excess −0.1 mmol/L, Hb 13.8 g/dl, K+ 3,7 mmol/L, Na+ 140 mmol/L.\nTo prevent her from further absorption of quetiapine a gastric lavage was performed (no pill fragments of ingested tablets were recovered) and the patient enterally received 25 g of activated charcoal with 5 g Glauber's salt (sodium sulfate) every 3 to 4 hours until dejection of black stool.\nLaboratory data on admission including serum electrolytes, liver, and renal function parameters and blood count remained normal except glucose of 8.12 mmol/L (145 mg/dl), CK of 333 U/L (control value remained unchanged) with no evidence of myocardial insufficiency or infarction, CRP of 32 mg/L (control value 8 hours later increased to 76 mg/L), TSH 6.0 mU/L (control value 8 hours later increased to 8.56 mU/L), and leucocytosis with 12.06 (×109/L).\nThe electrocardiogram at 36 hours postingestion revealed a moderately extended QTc interval measuring 436 millisseconds (at the upper limit of normal) compared to QTc interval of 388 ms after complete recovery. QTc-intervals were calculated using the Bazett formula [].\nA comprehensive drug screen via immunoassay was positive for tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines in particular, although these results could not be confirmed by UV-HPLC-methods.\nOne day after admission cardiac and pulmonary status was stable (without signs of QTc-prolongation, arrhythmia, or tachycardia), state of consciousness improved, so that she could be extubated and was transferred to psychiatric crisis ward within 67 hours after ingestion of quetiapine. The increased levels for glucose and TSH lasted for 2.5 days, CK turned to normal after 6 days and CRP after roughly two weeks, respectively (see ).\nSerum-samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected directly on arrival in the emergency department, 5 hours after admission and the following two days (four samples in total). Quetiapine serum concentrations were determined by a validated UV-HPLC-method (linearity range 0.03–4.00 mg/L, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 0.03 mg/L, limit of detection (LOD) 0.01 mg/L). Drug concentrations and patient's data (gender, age, weight, height) as well as the ingested amount of quetiapine were processed by a commonly used pharmacokinetic program Mw/Pharm 3.50 []. Pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated based on an open two-compartment model and a Bayesian fitting procedure.\nElimination half-life was calculated as follows:\n– t\n1/2 = ln 2/λ\nz (elimination, λ\nz is the rate constant corresponding to the terminal elimination).\nexemplifies the obtained quetiapine concentration levels and the software generated time-concentration profile based on a two-compartment model (solid-line). In addition, the expected time-concentration profile based on population-pharmacokinetic data is shown (dotted line). Absorption was supposed to be reduced because of anticholinergic effects of quetiapine on intestinal tract.\nThe elimination half-life was t\n1/2 = 5.3 hours and was calculated based on the four obtained quetiapine concentration levels (c1 = 4.22 mg/L; c2 = 2.77 mg/L; c3 = 0.06 mg/L; c4 = 0.06 mg/L) with regard to patient's medical records and displayed a moderately increased elimination compared to population pharmacokinetic parameters. Additionally, the absorption rate constant ka (time)−1 had to be adjusted and displayed a reduced absorption of quetiapine after ingestion. In this case the patient was supposed to have ingested 36 g quetiapine corresponding to a dosage of 580 mg/kg quetiapine. Volume of distribution was within the expected range (Vd = 9 L/kg based on fitted solid line, ).\nExpected peak quetiapine concentrations for population-pharmacokinetic data were higher than the fitted time-concentration profile based on measured quetiapine concentrations and a two-compartment model. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0",
    "Upper Limit": "0",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 32 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult female's the total body water percentage value is 0.50. The patient's weight is 62.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mEq. To convert from 140.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 62.0 * (140.0/140 - 1) = 0 L. The patient's free body water deficit is 0 L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 79-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department of Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Korea, complaining of abdominal pain that started one day prior. She was 150 cm tall and weighed 40 kg. She was on medication for diagnosed atrial fibrillation and had surgical history for uterine prolapse, rectal prolapse, and left femur neck fracture. Although the patient was not bedridden, she had spent most of her days in bed since undergoing left total hip replacement surgery two years prior. Her average frequency of defecation was every 3 days. Trauma or external injury was denied by the patient and her family.\nAt the emergency department, her body temperature was 36.7 ℃, blood pressure was 81/51 mmHg, heart rate was 106/min, and respiratory rate was 21 breaths/min. Whole abdominal distention and direct tenderness were noted. Laboratory examinations showed leukopenia (1.88 × 103/uL), and her serum C-reactive protein was 1.1 mg/dL. Blood biochemistries and urine analysis were normal.\nAn abdominal-pelvis computed tomography (CT) scan revealed pneumoperitoneum with diffuse mesenteric fat haziness of the left abdomen (Fig. a). However, the perforated site could not be clearly delineated. Because the patient’s abdominal pain was aggravated and her blood pressure gradually decreased, she underwent emergency surgery without further evaluation.\nIntravenous fluid resuscitation was performed in the emergency department. Second-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole were administered before emergency surgery. We performed laparoscopic surgery with the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia. The camera was inserted through an infraumbilical 12-mm trocar, and two 5-mm trocars were inserted at the right upper and lower quadrants. A 3-cm-sized perforated site was found at the antimesenteric border of the sigmoid-descending junction colon, with fecal material and reactive fluid outside the colon (Fig. b). In addition, a moderately dilated descending colon was found and was filled with hard feces. We mobilized the lateral detachment to create a colostomy using the perforation site (exteriorization) and formed a loop colostomy at the left upper quadrant. The patient developed ileus at postoperative day eight and recovered with conservative treatment including Levin tube insertion. No other events were observed, and she was discharged at postoperative day 29.\nThree months after the emergency surgery, the patient visited the outpatient clinic and required colostomy repair surgery. Colonoscopy was performed to identify causes of perforation, such as diverticulum or malignancy, which were negative. The patient was given a detailed explanation about the high possibility of perioperative morbidity and mortality due to advanced age, underlying diseases, and poor performance status; however, she requested colostomy removal. We performed colostomy repair under general anesthesia, with hand-sewn end-to-end anastomosis. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 10 without any adverse events.\nTwo years 4 months later, the patient was re-admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain. The patient had spent most of her days bedridden due to general weakness; her average frequency of defecation was every 4 or 5 days.\nOn admission at the emergency department, her body temperature was 36.5 ℃, blood pressure was 91/62 mmHg, heart rate was 112/min, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. Whole abdominal distention and direct tenderness were noted. Leukocytosis was identified (12.10 × 103/uL), and predominant neutrophils (91%) with low hemoglobin (8.4 g/dL) were found. Serum C-reactive protein was increased at 8 mg/dL, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 43 mm/h. Blood biochemistry showed hypoalbuminemia (2.7 g/dL) and hyponatremia (129 mEq/L), and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was increased at 12.4 ng/mL.\nAn abdominal-pelvis CT scan revealed pneumoperitoneum and wall discontinuity in the transverse colon, with adjacent dirty fluid collection in the mid- to left side mesentery, suggesting distal transverse colon perforation with spillage of fecal material (Fig. a).\nA treatment strategy similar to the previous procedure was applied. Intravenous fluid resuscitation was conducted, and second-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole were administered before emergency surgery. We performed another laparoscopic surgery under general endotracheal anesthesia. The camera and trocars were inserted through an infraumbilical approach via the right upper and lower quadrants. A 2-cm-sized perforation was found at the antimesenteric border of the distal transverse colon with fecal material, proximal to the previous perforation site (Fig. b). However, additional fecal material and dirty fluid were identified compared with the findings from 2 years prior. After the splenic flexure was completely mobilized, a loop colostomy was performed using the perforated site at the left upper quadrant (Fig. ).\nThe patient showed uneventful fever (38 ℃) and vomiting at postoperative day 18. A 3-cm-sized intraabdominal fluid collection was found at the left abdomen on CT scan (Fig. a), and she underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery. A small abscess was found and removed, and irrigation with saline was performed (Fig. b).\nSmall bowel obstruction occurred 4 days after the second surgery, and a Levin tube was inserted. She recovered without additional surgeries or adverse events and was discharged at 20 days after reoperation (38 days in total). Positron emission tomography, gastroscopy, and chest CT were performed to find the causes of elevated CEA before discharge, but no evidence of malignancy was found. She visited the outpatient clinic within one week and decided to use colostomy as a long-term approach. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "problem": "<Context> A 59-year-old male with a significant history of chronic alcoholism presented to the emergency room after an upper arm fracture on light gardening. X-ray of the shoulder showed a spiral fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the humerus with displacement and angulation of the distal fractured bone (). During the orthopedic surgery evaluation, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion and increasing abdominal girth. These alarming symptoms prompted a referral to cardiology for preoperative clearance. The patient got admitted for the pre-op workup. His past medical history was significant only for chronic alcohol abuse. He denied smoking and use of illicit drugs. His family history was noncontributory and negative for bone or liver disease. His vitals on admission were the following: temperature of 97.1, blood pressure of 160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and pulse rate of 60 beats per minute. Pertinent physical findings included mildly enlarged liver on palpation, grade IV/VI systolic murmur at the aortic area, and scattered basilar rales. There was no splenomegaly, jaundice, or lymphadenopathy.\nLaboratory workup showed hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, white blood count 5,700/mm3, platelets 115,000/mm3, BUN 14 m/dL, creatinine 0.62 mg/dL, calcium 8.7 mg/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, total proteins 8.4 g/dL, prothrombin time 14 seconds (control 10-13 seconds), activated partial thromboplastin time 34 sec (control 27-37 seconds), alkaline phosphatase 172 IU/L, ALT 71 IU/L, AST 107 IU/L, LDH 224 IU/L, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL, alpha-fetoprotein 8.7 ng/mL, hepatitis C antibody reactive, and hepatitis C viral load of 1,626,714. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the shoulder () showed an oblique comminuted fracture of the proximal humerus shaft as reported on X-ray in the emergency room. However, the fracture appeared to traverse through an ovoid lucency measuring approximately 5.5 × 2.8 cm within the proximal humerus shaft (). No discrete tumor or soft tissue mass was seen but was likely obscured by hemorrhage from the fracture. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Figures –) revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension, showing four liver lesions, with the largest measuring 3.1 cm, typical of HCC and another one hypoattenuating large lesion, measuring 5.8 × 5.2 cm, atypical for HCC. Staging scans did not reveal metastatic disease in the chest.\nThe differentials considered based on radiological features were a primary bone tumor or metastasis of an unknown primary or hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the right humerus with a bone biopsy at the fracture site with no postoperative complications. The biopsy results showed the presence of HCC (Figures and ). The patient was recommended to start radiation to the humerus and sorafenib after recovery from surgery. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

He developed sepsis and was consequently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which later changed to culture-sensitive antibiotics. The patient’s condition progressively deteriorated. Subsequently, on the 13th day of stay in the surgical unit, his vitals became unstable and his GCS score dropped. The department of anesthesia was called for the critical care and airway management of the patient.\nUpon assessment, the patient had a GCS score of 6/15 (E2V1M3), blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg, heart rate of 148 bpm, respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 80% while on 15 liters of supplemental oxygen using a non-rebreather mask. On examination, his spine had curvature disorder with mild cervical kyphosis, severe thoracic kyphoscoliosis, and moderate lumbar lordosis resulting in the upper body contorting towards the left side and severe restriction of neck movements (Figures , ). On auscultation, his cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. The chest examination revealed bilateral basal coarse crackles. The hematological and biochemical parameters were significant for leukocytosis, severe metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 5.8 mmol/L, and hypoxemia with a partial pressure of oxygen of 46 mmHg. Chest X-ray showed tracheal deviation toward the left side of the chest and a Cobb angle of 55° (Figure ). The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a right axis deviation with T-wave inversion.\nEmergency intubation was planned, along with resuscitation. The airway examination revealed a Mallampati classification of II and a restricted range of neck movement, especially during flexion. A team of anesthetists and assistants prepared the patient, attached the monitors, and checked the equipment for difficult intubation. Besides, the otorhinolaryngology (ENT) department was briefed about the case. Their team prepared for the \"can't intubate can't ventilate\" scenario and were in the standby position. The patient was propped with cushions below his left shoulder and the left lumbar region to optimize his position. He was given bag-mask ventilation initially but it was not effective as he started to desaturate. One of the anesthetists administered 2 mg of midazolam and 100 mg of suxamethonium before intubation. Subsequently, the senior anesthetist performed direct laryngoscopy using a size four blade and noted a Cormack-Lehane grade III view. A video laryngoscope was not employed due to a lack of availability. The tip of the epiglottis was marginally visualized and a gum elastic bougie (50 mm x 200 mm) was passed. Then an endotracheal tube of size 7.0 mm was railroad over the bougie. The chest was examined for the bilateral rise and auscultated for equal air entry in both lung fields. Due to unavailability, the capnometer was not utilized. Next, the endotracheal tube was fixed at 20 cm near the right oral commissure by an assistant. For management with ventilatory and vasopressor support, the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Additionally, she reported right-sided weakness. Six weeks prior to this presentation, she met the criteria for a diagnosis of SLE with arthritis, a photosensitive malar rash, and serum serology positivity for anti-nuclear antibodies (1:5120) as well as anti-double stranded DNA and anti-ribonuclear protein antibodies. A regimen of oral prednisone (10 mg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) was begun. In the weeks subsequent to the diagnosis and treatment of SLE, and prior to her hospitalization, the patient had a positive home pregnancy test, which was followed by an unusually heavy menstrual cycle and presumed spontaneous abortion. The patient did not seek medical attention, and therefore no uterine manipulation or evacuation was performed. The patient’s family history is significant for a maternal aunt and paternal cousin with SLE, and a maternal great-uncle who died from Libman-Sacks endocarditis.\nAt the time of the acute presentation, she was febrile to 38.9°C, oriented to self only, and had positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed an extra-axial fluid collection in the right frontotemporal region, with a mild local mass effect, but no midline shift and normal ventricles. Intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were initiated and the patient was transferred to our institution.\nOn arrival to our pediatric intensive care unit, the patient’s temperature was 38.8°C, blood pressure was 145/76 mmHg, heart rate was 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. She was drowsy and irritable when aroused, complaining of continued severe headache and neck pain. Neurological exam was significant for photophobia and meningismus. The remainder of the neurological exam and the ocular exam were normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 1525 white blood cells/µL (91% neutrophils), 65 red blood cells/µL, 252 mg/dL protein, and 56 mg/dL glucose. An MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed a moderately sized extra-axial effusion with secondary inflammatory response (\n and\n) and punctate diffusion abnormalities within the dependent portion of the lateral ventricles, consistent with pus or debris. The CSF culture was negative for bacteria, likely secondary to receipt of antibiotics prior to sampling, but the blood culture prior to antibiotic receipt grew GBS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was not performed. CSF studies for other pathogens, including cryptococcal antigen, detection of herpes simplex and varicella viruses by PCR, and specific cultures for acid-fast bacilli and fungi, were negative. Upon identification of GBS, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were discontinued, and treatment was continued with intravenous penicillin G (4,000,000 units every 4 hours) for two weeks. The patient showed rapid improvement on antibiotic therapy and had resolution of all neurologic symptoms within one week of admission. She was discharged to receive intravenous ceftriaxone for one additional week at home.\nNotably, the patient’s SLE was severely active during the course of this acute illness. Initial laboratory results at our institution demonstrated anti-Smith, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. She also had severe hypocomplementemia, doubling of serum creatinine, and nephrotic range proteinuria as assessed by 24-hour urine collection. Subsequent kidney biopsy demonstrated class V lupus nephritis. Induction therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone was started, which was then changed to oral prednisone (30 mg twice daily), mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice daily), and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once daily). Her serologically active SLE began to improve after her course of methylprednisolone, but was still active at the time of discharge. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "4",
    "Upper Limit": "4",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.8 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 70.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 1525.0 count/µL. To convert 1525.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 1525.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 1525000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 3 + 1 = 4 criteria met.

He was then transferred to our institution for the treatment of AKI and severe hypertension.\nAt the time of admission to our hospital the patient was fully conscious and alert. His body temperature was 37.2°C, blood pressure was 161/98 mm Hg, heart rate was 83 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min. His height was 174 cm and his body weight was 54 kg. Physical examination detected no signs of dehydration, rash, or other abnormalities of the neck, chest, abdomen, or extremities. He had been taking loratadine 10 mg/day for his allergic rhinitis for several months. Both loratadine and etilefrine had been discontinued upon admission to the previous hospital. There was no family history of kidney dysfunction, and he reported no episodes of intense exercise other than daily commuting by bicycle to school. No alcohol consumption, smoking, or illegal drug use were reported. His laboratory data at the time of transfer to our hospital are summarized in Table . Urinalysis showed mild proteinuria (0.66 g/gCr) and elevation of the tubulointerstitial injury marker β2 microglobulin (1,498 μg/L). Hematuria was not observed. His serum level of uric acid was low at 3.2 mg/dL and his fractional excretion of uric acid was high at 49.7%. Laboratory markers of rhabdomyolysis, diabetes mellitus, infection, and collagen diseases such as creatine phosphokinase, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, and autoimmune antibodies were all within normal range. An electrocardiogram disclosed left anterior hemiblock and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay that had been detected when he was an elementary school student. A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound echography showed bilateral mild kidney swelling with increased renal cortical echogenicity (Fig. ). No stenotic lesions were detected in the aorta or renal arteries, although the resistance index of the intrarenal arteries was slightly high (left 0.69, right 0.69), indicating a circulatory disturbance in the renal microvessels. Hydronephrosis and renal calcification were absent. An ultrasound-guided kidney biopsy performed 3 days after arrival at our hospital showed mild interstitial edema, vascular endothelial cell swelling in the renal interlobular arterioles, and no obvious signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (Fig. ). Treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of extracellular fluids and nicardipine gradually improved his kidney function and hypertension. His serum uric acid level decreased to 1.0 mg/dL (Fig. ), and his fractional excretion of uric acid was at 55.9% at 10 days after admission. He was ultimately diagnosed as having AKI with RHUC and discharged 12 days after transfer to our hospital. Hypouricemia was found in his parents and a sister, indicating a hereditary condition. However, genetic screening did not detect any known causative RHUC mutations on URAT1/SLC22A12 or GLUT9/SLC2A9 </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 31-year-old man visited our hospital for evaluation of dyspnea and malaise. He had been ill for 1 week prior to admission. His dyspnea gradually started to worsen 2 days prior to admission. One day before admission, he could not get out of the bathtub because of severe dyspnea. The following day, he was found in the bathtub by his family after about 10 h had passed and was transported to our hospital.\nThe patient had been diagnosed with mild dilated cardiomyopathy without coronary artery stenosis and valvular insufficiency 2 years previously, and diuretics were prescribed by the clinic. However, he stopped taking the diuretics and returning for regular checkups. On arrival to our hospital, his height was 163 cm, weight was 115.4 kg, and vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 82/53 mmHg; regular heart rate, 125 beats/min; oxygen saturation, 100% (oxygen mask, 6.0 L/min); respiratory rate, 42 breaths/min, and body temperature, 38.7°C. Physical examination revealed peeling skin on his buttocks and pressure marks associated with the long bath time extending from the back over the buttocks. Wheezing and moist rales were heard in the lungs.\nLaboratory examination showed the presence of inflammation (white blood cell count, 13,100 cells/μL; C-reactive protein, 16.7 mg/dL; procalcitonin, 41.95 ng/mL), renal impairment (blood urea nitrogen, 53.0 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.55 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 3.9 × 104/μL), heart failure (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 49,804 pg/mL), and coagulation system abnormalities (D-dimers, 20.6 μg/mL; P-fibrin degradation products, 44.5 μg/mL).\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at admission showed diffuse hypokinesis of wall motion and an ejection fraction of 56% without vegetation. An enlarged heart shadow and a patchy shadow were observed in the right middle lung field on a chest X-ray. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed nodules in the right middle lobe of the right lung, suspicious for septic emboli, along with splenomegaly.\nTwo sets of blood cultures were obtained. Under a preliminary diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammatory response associated with infection, intravenous administration of meropenem was initiated at 1 g every 8 h. The next day, both sets of blood cultures exhibited growth of Gram-positive streptococci (BD BACTEC blood culture system, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, Maryland, USA). The antimicrobial treatment was then switched from meropenem to combination therapy comprising ampicillin at 2 g every 8 h and clindamycin at 600 mg every 8 h for toxic shock. The Gram-positive culture was identified as SDSE (VITEK 2 system; BioMerieux Japan, Tokyo, Japan) on the third day. TTE on the third day revealed a reduction in the ejection fraction to 46%, emergence of severe mitral valve regurgitation, and a 5-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet mitral valve (Fig. ). Using the modified Duke criteria, we diagnosed IE (one major criterion and three minor criteria) caused by SDSE. The ampicillin and clindamycin were continued.\nA whole-body CT scan on hospital day 12 revealed a hemorrhagic infarction of the right frontal lobe (Fig. A), abscesses on the right frontal and occipital lobes, and an aneurysm of the mesenteric artery (Fig. B). A rapidly progressive new aneurysm emerged (as shown by comparison of the CT examinations on days 1 and 12) during the clinical course of SDSE bacteremia, and radiological examination was compatible with an infected aneurysm. Therefore, we diagnosed infectious aneurysms caused by SDSE. On day 18, gentamicin was added at 60 mg every 24 h with dose adjustment according to the patient's renal function. Because of the possibility of brain hemorrhage and concern about worsening infection due to embolization, we decided not to perform surgical and radiological intervention. On hospital day 41, the patient complained of sudden abdominal pain, and an abdominal CT scan revealed that the infected aneurysm of the splenic artery had ruptured and caused massive bleeding (Fig. A); there was a significant increase in the size of the aneurysm in the upper mesenteric artery (Fig. B), and new aneurysms were present in the right colic artery. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for the aneurysms of the splenic and upper mesenteric arteries was performed (Fig. ). A follow-up abdominal CT performed on day 68 demonstrated organized aneurysms of the right colic artery without intestinal ischemia or any additional bleeding.\nThe antimicrobial agents were adjusted according to the patient's renal function, and the ampicillin was increased to 12 g per day. The intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin were continued for 10 weeks, and the ampicillin was continued for 11 weeks. Several blood cultures were performed throughout the treatment period, but none were positive. A follow-up TTE on hospital day 70 demonstrated organization of the vegetation.

She is usually on oxygen two liters per minute at home for chronic hypoxic respiratory failure from IPF. She was on nintedanib 100 mg twice daily for her IPF and metoprolol 12.5 mg daily for her hypertension. Her pulmonary function test done two years ago showed moderate restrictive lung disease with a forced vital capacity of two liters (77% predicted), total lung capacity of three liters (63% predicted) and diffusion capacity of 58% predicted. Her physical exam was unremarkable. She was placed on isolation precautions because of her clinical presentation and her test for SARS-CoV-2 came back positive (Roche’s Cobas nucleic acid amplification test). She was exposed to her husband who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. She required three liters of supplemental oxygen for her hypoxemia. Chest radiology showed multifocal consolidations in both lungs (Figure ).\nShe received azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine as per the protocol. However, her condition deteriorated requiring 10 liters of supplemental oxygen and on day 3 she was transferred to intensive care unit and intubated for worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. She required 100% fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired gas (FiO2) and 10 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator. A limited bedside echocardiogram revealed normal left and right ventricular function. Her inflammatory markers continued to worsen. Ferritin which was 600 ng/mL at the time of her presentation, worsened to 50,480 ng/mL. Her white blood cell (WBC) count was 15,000/mm3 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 800/mm3, procalcitonin was 0.14 ng/mL, D-dimer was 3.3 µg/mL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 628 IU/L. She received a single intravenous dose of tocilizumab 600 mg. On day 4, she developed severe septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction (worsening renal function, liver function, circulatory collapse and respiratory failure) requiring norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine and angiotensin II. She was started on intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg three times daily, but despite all the aggressive measures she died on day 5.

He had periodic sharp excruciating pain on the left side of his face radiating from the back of his left eyeball. Lacrimation, conjunctival congestion, and nasal discharge were present on the left side. The present cluster was started one day ago. He experienced two severe episodes the day before; each lasted about 60 minutes with a six-hour pain relief between them. On the day of admission, he came with the same severe hemifacial pain initiated less than five minutes ago (he worked in the same hospital that researchers practiced). He was otherwise healthy and had no past medical history except some orthopaedic surgeries (due to an accident). He was not an alcohol or drug abuser. He had the same abrupt pain every three to six months that lasted about 15 days (the shortest and the longest clusters he remembered were five and 17 days, respectively). His symptoms started since five years ago and each year he experienced two to four clusters of headache on average, albeit he remembered a year with only a seven-day episode. The pain was not always completely improved with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and very often, he was admitted to the hospital to receive oxygen therapy and intravenous painkillers. He mentioned that his first headache lasted six hours without any medication, as he was reluctant to receive any medication at first; however, he took painkillers for his following headaches. By taking medication, disabling episode of headaches lasted between 15 to 180 minutes; however, some mild to moderate pain remained for the same episode or following days of that cluster for which, he received trivial medication. He noted that he took just few hours sick leave and usually tolerated the pain. Once he received opioid (20 mg of intravenous meperidine) for his pain; however, it just added dizziness and nausea with no pain relief. He was reluctant to receive any prophylactic medication for his headaches. In his recent episode, he was admitted and hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring was utilized. Intravenous line was prepared and fluid was infused. He did not receive any supplemental oxygen. He received 20 mg of propofol (propofol 1% MCT/LCT, Fresenius, Germany) every four minutes () and simultaneous titrated dose of alfentanil (100 μg) every ten minutes. After the third injection of propofol and second prescription of alfentanil (about 15 minutes from the initiation of therapy), he reported acceptable pain relief with a mild remaining pain. He received a total dose of 120 mg of propofol (with the same protocol, however, as we encountered some drowsiness with no desaturation, we extended the interval for injection to every ten minutes and overall, it took about 50 minutes). Moreover, a total of 500 μg of alfentanil was infused (about 50 minutes). At this time he reported complete recovery with no remaining pain. He was just monitored and was discharged after two hours with no medication. He had no more episodes in the following days. In a four-month follow up, he did not experience any cluster headache. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 44-year-old female patient, 155 cm in height and 65 kg in weight, who visited our hospital with a main complaint of dysmenorrhea and hypermenorrhea was diagnosed with uterine myoma and decided to undergo a laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. The patient's past medical history showed that she had a cystectomy for an ovarian tumor ten years ago and subtotal-thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer five years ago. The patient was taking 0.15 mg of Synthroid once a day. Since the preoperative hemoglobin levels were 7.8 g/dl, two units of packed red blood cells were transfused. There was no other specific finding in the preoperative examination.\nFor preanesthetic medication, an intramuscular injection of 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate was given. Electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oxymetry, and Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring (A-3000 EEG BIS monitor, Aspect Medical system, USA) started immediately after the patient arrived at the operation room. The vital signs before the induction of anesthesia were as follows; a blood pressure of 139/87 mmHg, a heart rate of 70/min, and a pulse oxygen saturation of 99%. For the induction of anesthesia, 120 mg of propofol and 40 mg of lidocaine were mixed and intravenously injected. Then, 100 mg of succinylcholine was intravenously injected for endotracheal intubation. During the endotracheal intubation, 7 mm of a single endotracheal tube was fixed with the point marked with \"21 cm\" attached to the lips after checking that breathing sound was well heard on both sides. Vecuronium 4 mg was intravenously injected to maintain muscle relaxation, and 2-3 vol% of sevoflurane, 2 L/min of oxygen, and 2 L/min of nitrous oxide were used to maintain the anesthesia. The tidal volume was regulated to keep the end-tidal CO2 pressure at 30-35 mmHg, and the depth of the anesthesia was controlled to maintain a BIS index of 40-60. The laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy began with the patient in the lithotomy position. The operation continued without any problems, and the vital signs of the patient were stably maintained. The intra-abdominal pressure was kept at 10-15 mmHg. Suddenly, at two hours after the initiation of the operation, the blood pressure dropped from 110/63 mmHg to 78/41 mmHg, end-tidal CO2 pressure dropped from 45 mmHg to 20 mmHg, and the pulse oxygen saturation dropped to 70%. The peak airway pressure increased from 23 cmH2O to 33 cmH2O, and the heart rate increased from 70/min to 125/min. Promptly, 5 mg of ephedrine and 100 µg of phenylephrine were intravenously injected two times at five-minute intervals. Intravenous injection of 10 mg of ephedrine was then done, but the blood pressure did not increase. After 100 µg of epinephrine was injected, the blood pressure increased to 182/117 mmHg, the heart rate increased to 140/min, and the pulse oxygen saturation was maintained at 100%. Following the intravenous injection of 15 mg of esmolol, the patient remained in a stable state with the blood pressure at 107/74 mmHg, heart rate at 103/min, pulse oxygen saturation at 100%, end-tidal CO2 pressure at 35 mmHg, and peak airway pressure at 20 cmH2O. For continuous arterial pressure monitoring, a 22-gauge catheter was inserted into the radial artery in the left arm and invasive blood pressure monitoring was started. The results of the arterial blood gas analysis done at that time were a pH of 7.412, a PaCO2 of 38.9 mmHg, a PO2 of 173 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 99.8% (FiO2: 0.5). Massive carbon dioxide embolism, pulmonary thrombus, tension pneumothorax, and right atrial thrombus were suspected as the cause, and a transesophageal echocardiography (HDI3000, PHILIPS, Netherlands) was done to differentiate the cause and evaluate cardiac function. A lesion that looked like a lump was found in the right atrium, and the size shown on the monitor was 2.8 × 4.1 cm. The shape of the lesion was round. A freely-moving echo-density was found in the region that did not overlap the right atrium, although the overall motion was not great (). The right atrium and the right ventricle were not hypertrophied but the size of the right atrium was larger than normal. The interventricular septum was moved toward the right ventricle in the systole. The motion of the tricuspid valve was normal, but the tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary artery pressure could not be measured because of the lump density. The function of the left heart was normal, and thrombosis in the aorta was not suspected. We assumed that the partial movement of the thrombus to the pulmonary artery might have caused the pulmonary thrombosis because the initial vital signs had not been good even though the vital signs were normal since the thrombus was localized to the right atrium. Confirming that it was right atrium thrombosis with a cooperative diagnosis from a thoracic surgeon and a cardiology specialist, we decided to perform a thromboembolectomy, which is the most rapid treatment, and received consent from the caregiver after providing an explanation on the patient's condition since we assumed that the same phenomena could occur once again even though the vital signs were normal at that time. Although thromboembolectomy had to be rapidly performed for the treatment of right atrium thrombosis, we decided to perform it after a simple hemostasis in the obstetrics and gynecology department because the vital signs were stable at that time. No specific change was found in the right atrium thrombus during the hemostasis.\nThe hemostasis was finished after about 20 minutes, and a central venous catheter was inserted through the right internal jugular vein for the thromboembolectomy. The method for anesthetic maintenance was changed to intravenous injections of 10 µg/kg/h of fentanyl, 50 µg/kg/h of midazolam, and 0.2 mg/kg/h of vecuronium. When preparing for the thromboembolectomy, there was no change in the electrocardiography, capnography, end-tidal CO2 concentration, and airway pressure, and no hemodynamic change was found in the blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oxygen saturation. After sternotomy was performed in the operation, we observed all the other structures in the heart using transesophageal echocardiography, but the thrombus that had existed in the right atrium was not found. Even though there was no symptom or sign that suggested movement of the thrombus to the pulmonary artery, we were not able to judge that the thrombus was spontaneously resolved. Since the possible movement of the thrombus to the pulmonary artery or other structures could not be explicitly excluded, we decided to continue the operation after consulting with the thoracic surgeon and the cardiology specialist. Aortic cannulation, superior vena cava cannulation, and inferior vena cava cannulation were smoothly performed. Following the aortic cross clamp, cardiac arrest was carried out using a cardioplegia, and open-heart surgery was done under cardiopulmonary bypass. During the cardiopulmonary bypass, the activated clotting time (ACT) was maintained for more than 480 seconds. Since the thrombus was found neither in the right atrium nor at the origin of the pulmonary artery, the catheter was deeply inserted into the right pulmonary artery and a few thrombi, 7 mm long and 2 mm thick, were eliminated by suction. The thrombi found during the operation were much smaller than the thrombus found by the transesophageal echocardiography before, but the right atrium was sutured because no more thrombus was found and there were no abnormal findings in the other regions. Cardiac function was spontaneously recovered without defibrillation, and the ACT was reversed to 145 seconds before weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to verify cardiac function recovery and the existence of a thrombus and no specific problems were found (). However, another operation was performed for the purpose of hemostasis just after the thromboembolectomy since the bleeding was severe at the region where the operation was performed in the obstetrics and gynecology department. During the entire operation, 16 units of packed RBCs, 8 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets were transfused.\nAfter the operation in the obstetrics and gynecology department, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit without reversing muscle relaxation. Extubation was performed after the patient's consciousness and muscle strength recovered on the first day after the operation. The D-dimer level increased to 8.24 µg/ml, but lung perfusion scanning did not show any pulmonary thrombus. The patient was transferred to the general ward on the second day. The lower extremity vein Doppler scanning performed on the 14th day did not show any deep vein thrombi. The postoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac functions. The patient was discharged on the 30th day after the operation without any problems. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "Lower Limit": "272.656",
    "Upper Limit": "301.356",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 7.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 7.6 mmol. To convert 7.6 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.6 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.008 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.008 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.224 g bun. To convert 0.224 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.224 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 224.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 224.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 22.4 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 7.6 mmol bun/L converts to 22.4 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 4.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 4.9 mmol. To convert 4.9 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.9 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.901 g glucose. To convert 0.901 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.901 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 901.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 901.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 90.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 4.9 mmol glucose/L converts to 90.1 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 137.0 + (22.4 / 2.8) + (22.4 / 18) = 287.006 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 287.006 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 287.006 mOsm/kg.",

    "Upper Limit": "7.35",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 146.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 106.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 146.0 mEq/L - (106.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 19.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.0 - 12 = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.0 mEq/L.",

Prior to the collapse, the patient reported having symptoms of dizziness, cough, fatigue, and an inability to keep his balance for one day. However, he did not have any of the typical suspicious symptoms, which correlate with COVID-19. He denied having dyspnea, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, travel history, sick contacts, headaches, visual changes, loss of consciousness, palpations, or chest pain.\nUpon admission, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. His vitals were a temperature of 101°F, blood pressure of 137/82 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygen saturation of 99% via a 6 L nasal cannula. His skin was dry and pale. Rale was heard on bilateral lower lung fields. Initial testing revealed that creatine kinase levels were greater than 5,000 U/L. The patient also had mild elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Furthermore, lactic acid and leukocyte count were within normal range. There were no premature neutrophils (bands) present, and rapid flu testing was negative. Admission chest X-ray was unremarkable for acute changes when compared to studies from previous admission ().\nThe patient was admitted to the medical floor and was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed pneumonia vs. bronchitis leading to a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient had a one-time read of fever on admission; vitals and labs were relatively stable during the first forty-eight hours. On day 2 of admission, the patient remained stable and asymptomatic with no changes on physical exam. However, fifty-two hours after admission, he became febrile with a temperature of 101.7°F, and his oxygen saturation declined to 88% on room air and 92% via a 6 L nasal cannula. Notably, he was found to be diaphoretic but able to talk in full sentences. Physical exam revealed new wheezing sounds in the bilateral lung bases. Given his deteriorating conditions, it was decided to test the patient for COVID-19 given the rapid spread of the virus nationwide. Prior to this point, the patient did not have any of the typical criteria that were identified in current papers or guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, besides a low-grade fever. At this point, necessary samples were taken (respiratory viral panel, COVID-19, rapid strep, and throat culture) and appropriate isolation was initiated. Arterial blood gas was obtained while the patient was on room air, which showed 45% partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and 84% saturation. Due to concerns for additional complications including differential such as a pulmonary embolism, the patient was sent for a CT angiography of the chest (Figures and ), which was negative for pulmonary embolism but did show findings consistent with COVID-19-positive patients [–].\nDue to an increased risk of aerosolization while on BiPAP, the patient was placed on 50% high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) which improved his saturations to 98% and PaO2 to 102 mmHg, while still maintaining a low threshold for possible intubation. He maintained a stable respiratory status for several days, including ambulation without becoming symptomatic/desaturating. Respiratory status was stable for approximately four days while the patient was on HFNC, with saturation maintaining above 92%, without signs of acute distress. However, the patient continued to spike fevers intermittently, with a maximum temperature of 103.2°F. Oxygen requirements on HFNC decreased on day 3 from 50% to 35%, where he was able to maintain his SaO2 above 94%. The SARS-CoV-2 test was positive. On day 5 and after this clinical improvement, he developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). He was found to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 (). The ventilation setting was adjusted for the management of ARDS, which improved oxygenation; however, the patient remained hypercapnic. Noticeably, the patient's blood pressure declined and required pressors. Plaquenil and Kaletra were initiated 6 days after admission.\nOn day 10, which was approximately four days into his ICU stay, the patient developed cardiac arrest and later died. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Two months prior, he suffered chills after eating kebabs, followed by a fever (up to 39 °C), accompanied by a headache and dizziness. He received anti-infective and anti-inflammatory therapy for a pulmonary infection at the local hospital. However, he still had a high fever with fatigue. On April 23, the serum agglutination test for Brucella was positive, with a titer of 1:400. Both the blood and bone marrow cultures were negative, and after he was diagnosed with brucellosis, therapy with doxycycline, moxifloxacin, and streptomycin was initiated. After 1 month of regular anti-brucellosis therapy, although the peak temperature had dropped to 38 °C, he still had the fever and aggravated anaemia. Due to the negative repeat test for Brucella, the regimen was adjusted to isoniazid, levofloxacin, streptomycin, rifampicin and dexamethasone anti-tuberculosis therapy. He continued to experience the recurrent fever until admission to our hospital on June 5.\nIn March 2009, he had undergone a Bentall procedure and ventricular septal repair due to congenital heart disease and was found to be positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen but did not receive antiviral therapy. The patient was immunocompetent, serologically negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and denied any history of contact with cattle and sheep.\nAt admission, his body temperature was 37.5 °C, his heart rate was 78 beats/min, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his blood pressure was 120/66 mmHg. On physical examination, he was found to be anaemic. His abnormal laboratory findings were as follows: aggravated normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin: 71 g/mL), elevated levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 43.1 mg/L; procalcitonin: 0.38 ng/mL), acute renal insufficiency (blood urea nitrogen: 23.1 mmol/L; creatinine: 343 μmol/L) and hypoproteinemia (albumin: 30 g/L) with normal levels of aminotransferase (Table ). An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis was positive. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected M. tuberculosis complex from two blood samples. However, the Xpert MTB assay and acid-fast bacilli smear for sputum samples were both negative. The blood cultures remained negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest suggested bilateral pneumonia (Fig. ). Abdominal ultrasound revealed enlargement of his liver, spleen (169 × 65 mm) and kidney (left: 145 × 67 mm; right: 146 × 52 mm). Echocardiography showed mechanical prosthetic aortic valve paravalvular abscess without vegetation formation (Fig. ). Then, the patient was empirically administered fosfomycin and daptomycin as a treatment for gram-positive bacterial infection, but his body temperature remained high (up to 38.4 °C). Thus, the regimen was switched to anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid 0.3 g once daily, ethambutol 0.75 g once daily, moxifloxacin 0.4 g once daily and linezolid 0.6 g once daily); however, his temperature remained between 37 and 38.5 °C.\nThen, he was transferred to the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Shanghai Sixth People’s hospital for a second surgery on June 25. Surprisingly, NGS detected a large number of M. tuberculosis complex sequences in intraoperative samples of the aortic root abscesses. The patient had postoperatively intermittent fever, mostly peaking in the afternoon. After 2 weeks of combined anti-tuberculosis treatment with linezolid (0.6 g once daily), rifampicin (0.3 g twice daily), pyrazinamide (0.5 g three times daily), ethambutol (0.75 g once daily), isoniazid (0.3 g once daily) and moxifloxacin (0.6 g once daily), his body temperature returned to normal, and his laboratory parameters improved (Table ); finally, he was discharged. On July 31, the culture of the aortic valve intraoperative scrapings was found to be positive for M. tuberculosis, which further confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculous PVE.

Preoperatively, the patient showed no findings suggesting a difficult airway; airway examination revealed mouth opening to 4 cm, full range of neck movements, and Mallampati grade II. An epidural catheter was placed at the L2-3 epidural space. After preoxygenation with 100 % oxygen, general anesthesia was rapidly induced using 0.1 mg of fentanyl and 120 mg of propofol. Manual bagmask ventilation was easily achieved after loss of consciousness, and 50 mg of rocuronium was administered.\nWe attempted to place a tracheal tube using a Macintosh laryngoscope, but unexpectedly, this proved impossible because of an obstacle, a large and roundish oropharyngeal tumor in the field of view (Fig. ). Macintosh laryngoscopy revealed only epiglottis (Cormack-Lehane grade 3). We then used a video laryngoscope (King Vision®; King Systems, Noblesville, IN) and achieved successful intubation.\nAnesthesia was maintained using 2 % sevoflurane, remifentanil at 0.05 μg/kg/min, and 120 mg of rocuronium in total. Five milliliters of 0.375 % ropivacaine was administered through the epidural catheter, and continuous dosing with 1.5 % ropivacaine was provided by epidural infusion. The operation was completed safely. We performed extubation after confirming sufficient spontaneous breathing and response of the patient, as is usually done.\nAfter surgery, we performed magnetic resonance imaging of the head to diagnose the oropharyngeal tumor. A giant mass was seen attached to the posterior ethmoid sinus, extending from the right intranasal cavity to the nasopharynx. We diagnosed the oropharyngeal tumor as a large choanal polyp (Fig. ).\nPolypectomy was performed under general anesthesia another day. We again successfully performed tracheal intubation with the King Vision® video laryngoscope. The operation was completed without any other adverse events, and a choanal polyp measuring 14 cm in maximum diameter was removed. The definitive diagnosis from histopathological examination was choanal polyp.\nIn this case, the patient showed no symptoms of airway obstruction or dysphagia in preoperative interviews. Moreover, no abnormality in the oral cavity was apparent on ocular inspection. We thus could not have predicted the difficult intubation preoperatively. Fortunately, mask-ventilation proved easy, and intubation was safely achieved by displacing the mass under video laryngoscope.\nAirway obstruction after extubation was a concern. After considering that the patient had no symptoms of airway obstruction preoperatively, and no injury to the mass or intraoral bleeding with the intubation maneuver, we judged the risk of airway obstruction as low and performed extubation as usual. Neither airway obstruction nor respiratory symptoms occurred after emergence from anesthesia.\nLarge choanal polyps have been reported in the otolaryngology area, albeit rarely, but details of anesthesia and airway management for large oropharyngeal tumors have not been sufficiently discussed []. In our case, mask-ventilation fortunately proved easy, probably because the structure of the choanal polyp hanging down from the choana made airway obstruction unlikely. On the other hand, another report has described a difficult airway with a different kind of oropharyngeal polyp [], and attention to airway management is warranted in these cases. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

His past medical history was unremarkable and he denied any history of tobacco or intravenous drug use (IVDU), chest trauma, sexually transmitted infection (STI) or open tuberculosis (TB) contact. He was diagnosed with pulmonary TB based on constitutional symptoms and chest X-ray findings, and had completed a 6-month course of anti-TB medications (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) 7 weeks prior his visit to our institution. He was somewhat symptom-free for about 3 weeks when he developed recurrent episodes of breathlessness, awareness of heartbeats and coughing blood, which had gradually worsened and persisted for about 4 weeks prior this index visit.\nOn examination, he was a sick-looking but oriented and well-kempt young man. He had a blood pressure of 92/57 mmHg, pulse rate of 121 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths/minute and temperature of 36.7 °C. His body mass index (BMI) was 21.2 kg/m2 (weight 59 kg and height 1.67 m). A physical examination revealed conjuctival and palmar pallor but there were no stigmata of connective tissue disorders, systemic vasculitides or congenital heart disease. A respiratory system examination revealed bilateral symmetrical chest movements; however, dullness and reduced breath sounds were noted on the mammary and inframammary regions bilaterally on percussion and auscultation respectively. An examination of the cardiovascular system revealed accentuated second heart sound (S2) with early diastolic (grade 1/6) and holosystolic (grade 2/6) murmurs at the pulmonic and tricuspid areas respectively.\nHematological and biochemical tests revealed iron deficiency anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 8.18 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 61.8 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 19.2 pg/cell and red cell distribution width (RDW) 21.9%], prolonged bleeding time [prothrombin time (PT) 14.6 s and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 32.7 s], and mild hyponatremia [sodium concentration (Na+) 132 mmol/L]. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, and syphilis were all negative. Moreover, occult blood test was negative and an abdominal ultrasonography scan was unremarkable. A sputum culture revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3++ sensitive to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. A chest X-ray showed bilateral, ovoid-shaped perihilar opacities extending to lower lung zones with loss of silhouette sign on the left cardiac border (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed a sinus tachycardia while echocardiography (ECHO) was evident for right ventricular hypertrophy, mild tricuspid regurgitation with estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 29 mmHg (that is, mild pulmonary hypertension) and multiple focal dilatations along the right and left pulmonary arteries. Systolic functions were, however, preserved (ejection fraction 53%). A GeneXpert test was positive. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest showed bilateral multiple pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms with surrounding hematoma together with adjacent cystic changes, consolidations and tree-in-bud appearance (Figs. , , , and ). The aneurysms on the right pulmonary artery measured 3.81×2.55 cm and 6.96×5.34 cm whereas those on the left measured 2.61×2.03 cm, 6.85×4.45 cm and 7.05×4.03 cm respectively. His main pulmonary artery (2.55 cm), ascending (2.28 cm), arch (1.89 cm), and descending aorta (2.00 cm) had normal caliber and dimensions. We entertained a diagnosis of bilateral multiple pulmonary pseudoaneurysms associated with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis and admitted him to the general medical ward. Intravenous ciprofloxacin 500 mg 12 hourly, bisoprolol 5 mg once daily, tadalafil (40 mg) and ferrous sulfate (270 mg) plus folic acid (300 mcg) were initiated. Moreover, our patient was counseled regarding surgery and prognosis of his condition; however, he refused to undergo any surgical procedure. After 9 days of hospitalization, our patient died of aneurismal rupture.

The patient had a history of multilobar (right middle lobe and right upper lobe) pneumonia over the past 2 years, and had been admitted to a nearby hospital with the chief complaint of a cough that had worsened over the previous month. She usually had a dry cough after a cold, which did not last for more than 2 months. Following a diagnosis of acute eosinophilic bronchitis and focal pneumonia, the patient was administered antibiotics. However, her pneumonia did not improve and she was transferred to our hospital for further examination.\nShe had no disease and no operation history. She was nonsmoker and social drinker. She had no family history and her occupation was teacher.\nBlood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, respiration rate was 20 per minute, and body temperature was 36.8℃. General findings indicated no pain, but chest auscultation revealed minor rales in the right middle lobe. Heart auscultation revealed a normal beat without cardiac murmur. No edema was observed in the abdomen or extremities, and no lymph node enlargement was apparent.\nThe results of an arterial blood gas examination performed at the time of admission were PH 7.43, PaCO2 33 mm Hg, PaO2 78 mm Hg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L. A peripheral blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 44%, a white blood cell count of 8,600/mm3, and a platelet count of 250,000/mm3.\nThe results of biochemical analysis were a total protein level of 6.8 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspirate aminotransferase 38 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 200 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 m/hr, blood urea nitrogen 12.9 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. Electrolytes and blood glucose levels were normal, and urine examination revealed specific gravity of 1.025, pH 6.0, no proteinuria, and a red blood cell count of 30-49 per high-power field. Subsequent examination revealed no worsening of hematuria. Empirical antibiotic treatment, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) sputum smear, and sputum eosinophil tests were performed, in order to differentiate community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Sputum bacteria examination did not yield specific findings, and very few sputum eosinophils were observed. The concentration of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen detected was 1.3 ng/mL(with-in normal range), and an interferon-gamma release assay was positive. However, the AFB smear and TB polymerase chain reaction were negative, and AFB culture yielded no-growth. Tests for rheumatic factors and antinuclear antibody yielded no specific findings, and the patient did not complain of rheumatic-disease-related symptoms. Electrocardiography and echocardiography yielded normal results, and pulmonary function examination revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.83 L (90% of reference), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) 2.27 L (93% of reference), FEV1/FVC 92%, and diffusion capacity adjusted by the alveolar volume 97%, indicating mild obstructive ventilation disturbance.\nSimple chest radiography revealed nodular lesions around the pulmonary hilum of the right upper lobe (). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 1.8-cm speculated nodule around the inferior margin of the right upper lobe, and the differential diagnosis of focal pneumonia or lung cancer was required (). A bronchoscopy revealed no abnormalities in the bronchi. Kidney ultrasonography and a gastroscopy that were performed to confirm the amyloidosis lesions did not yield specific findings; so video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)-assisted pulmonary wedge resection was conducted for early differentiation of lung cancer. No surgical complications were encountered.\nHistology indicated a thickened interstitium due to eosinophilic amorphous material deposits, with some giant cells and histiocyte infiltration (). Congo red staining for amyloidosis was positive, and under a polarized microscope the nodule exhibited a unique apple-green birefringence ().\nAdditional examinations for amyloidosis, blood and urine immunoelectrophoresis, and immunofixation were performed. IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD concentrations were normal, as were the immunofixation results ().

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day. The patient's dose of OxyCODONE is 70 mg. The patient takes 3 doses/day of OxyCODONE. This means that the patient takes 70 mg/dose OxyCODONE * 3 dose/day = 210 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of OxyCODONE, multiply the 210 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1.5 mme/mg, giving us 315.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of OxyCODONE to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 315.0 = 315.0 mme/day. The patient's dose of HYDROcodone is 30 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of HYDROcodone. This means that the patient takes 30 mg/dose HYDROcodone * 1 dose/day = 30 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROcodone, multiply the 30 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 30 mme/day.

    "problem": "<Context> A 24 year-old, 95 kilogram (Kg), 165 centimeter (cm) woman was scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy for an indeterminate pelvic mass. Historical workup more than 5 years prior for congenital hypotonia, delayed acquisition of motor skills, persistent discoordination, and chronic fatigue included a muscle biopsy with pathologic examination and oxidative phosphorylation enzymology as well as a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and multi-gene panel for cellular energetic defects including 656 genes. Skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation enzymology was equivocal for a possible complex 1 defect and decreased enzymatic activity of complex 1 was observed. Although no associated mitochondrial DNA defect was identified, she acquired a diagnosis of possible MM. Gene sequencing revealed a variant of uncertain significance, reported with conflicting predictions of “possibly damaging” and “tolerated,” in the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene (Position Chromosome 19: 38955314, Exon 23, Variant c.[2822C > T]), suggestive of possible MH susceptibility. There was no family history of MH. Additional studies included normal electromyography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echo. Her past medical history was otherwise notable for fibromyalgia/chronic musculoskeletal pain, possible spondyloarthropathy, endometriosis, adnexal cyst, and ectopic pregnancy. She had undergone prior surgical procedures with neuraxial or peripheral nerve blockade. She was warned by medical providers elsewhere to avoid propofol, lactated Ringer’s solution, and succinylcholine.\nGiven this history, we favored regional anesthesia and the surgical service agreed to an open rather than the originally scheduled laparoscopic procedure. She was pre-medicated with 1 gram (g) oral acetaminophen and intravenous (IV) fentanyl 50 micrograms (mcg) and midazolam 3 milligrams (mg). A combined spinal epidural procedure was performed with the patient sitting upright and with midline approach at lumbar interspace 3–4 with an 18 gauge Tuohy needle, 27 gauge Whitacre needle, and 20 gauge epidural catheter. Loss of resistance with preservative-free normal saline was obtained at 6 cm. Intrathecal injection of 2 milliliters (mL) 0.75% bupivacaine with 8.25% dextrose, 15 mcg fentanyl, and 200 mcg epinephrine was performed. The epidural catheter threaded easily and a test dose of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 5 mcg/mL epinephrine was negative for intrathecal or intravascular catheter location. Approximately 30 min later, the patient had a dermatomal level around thoracic (T) spinal nerve T8, so the catheter was bolused with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine. After confirming T6 dermatomal level, incision was made. Anesthesia was maintained with divided doses of 10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 5 mcg/mL epinephrine and 10 mL 2% lidocaine. For sedation, in addition to previously mentioned pre-medications, she received IV divided doses of 30 mg ketamine, 9 mg midazolam, and 550 mcg fentanyl. For antiemetics she received 0.625 mg droperidol IV, 4 mg dexamethasone IV, and 4 mg ondansetron IV. She was maintained on a 5% dextrose and normal saline IV infusion at 100 mL/hour with intraoperative point-of-care glucose monitoring. Baseline and perioperative lactates were not monitored, although in retrospect we would include this laboratory evaluation. Skin temperature was monitored and normothermia was maintained with a forced air warmer. Surgical time was 4 h and included Pfannenstiel incision, lysis of adhesions, and left ovarian cystectomy. At the conclusion of the case the surgeons infiltrated the wound with a solution of 20 mL 1.3% liposomal bupivacaine in 100 mL normal saline and the epidural catheter was removed.

The patient developed fever the next day, and the area of swelling on his right forearm expanded, with blisters in the center. He visited a local clinic and was prescribed cefcapene pivoxil for the diagnosis of cellulitis. However, on the day of admission, the patient developed fever, chills, and general fatigue, and the swelling on his forearm worsened.

Urine analysis revealed normal findings, and chest radiography revealed no pneumonia.\nInitial workups in the emergency room raised suspicion for a tick bite infection with cellulitis; hence, intravenous cefazolin (1 g every 8 hours) and minocycline (100 mg every 12 hours) were initiated.\nOn day 2, subcutaneous bleeding appeared on his left forearm, which was on the sphygmomanometer attachment site on the right upper arm. Given that his platelet count was decreased to 35,000 cells/μL, platelet transfusion (100,000 U) was performed. On day 3, his platelet count, and additional examination revealed the following results: ferritin level 2045 ng/mL (normal range, 39–340 ng/dL), and human immunodeficiency virus antibody negative. Blood culture on admission revealed P aeruginosa, and the lesion culture grew non-fermenters, such as gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus-like gram-positive cocci. Infectious diseases consultation was performed, and within 5 days the lesion developed from a macule, into a papule, and then to a hemorrhagic bulla with P aeruginosa bacteremia, suggestive of ecthyma gangrenosum. After repeated blood cultures, his treatment regimen was switched to cefepime (2 g every 8 hours), vancomycin (1 g every 12 hours), and minocycline (100 mg every 12 hours).\nOn day 4, microscopic examination of the peripheral blood smear revealed that 50% leukocytes were abnormal lymphocytes, mostly promyelocytes. Bone marrow aspirate examination and immunophenotyping confirmed the diagnosis of APL with PML-retinoic acid alpha receptor (RARA). The patient received induction chemotherapy with all-trans retinoic acid, cytarabine, and idarubicin.\nOn day 5, blood cultures from day 3 also revealed P aeruginosa, whereas pus culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was continued on cefepime based on the findings of the susceptibility test, and 8 successfully treated with a 14-day course of antibiotics. IgM and IgG antibodies for Rickettsia japonica and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome tested negative. The patient achieved complete remission after treatment for APL with PML-RARA, and no evidence of APL relapse has been noted at the 3-year follow-up.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mEq. To convert from 138.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 11.6 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 208.0 mg/dL.

    "problem": "<Context> A 63-year-old woman with the history of hypertension presented to the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic with significant shortness of breath on minimal exertion and fatigue for 3 weeks. Patient was hypoxic to 74% and tachypneic to 30 breaths/min and required endotracheal intubation. Physical exam was unremarkable. Shortly, thereafter, she became persistently hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with rate of 70 bpm, tall R wave in V2 and symmetric T wave inversions in precordial leads (). Chest radiograph post intubation showed bilateral patchy infiltrates. Initial severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test was negative while the second PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done 24 h later returned positive.\nInitial troponin T was 0.07 ng/ml with maximum at 0.22 ng/ml (reference range < 0.01 ng/ml) and NT-proBNP was 12 945 pg/ml. Elevated white blood cell count (21.1 × 103/μl), creatinine (1.45 mg/dl), C-reactive protein (25.9 mg/dl) and ferritin (546 ng/ml) and D- Dimer 4.34 (ref range ≤ 0.63 mg/l) was noted. Serial ECGs remained stable.\nPatient remained persistently hypoxic with PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 85 which along with CXR findings is suggestive of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Central venous oxygen saturation of 62% suggested the possibility of mixed shock.\nComputed tomography angiogram of chest was deferred due to hemodynamic instability and refractory hypoxemia. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated. Due to institutional COVID-19 policy for transthoracic echocardiography to minimize personnel exposure, focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) was performed, which revealed mildly increased right ventricular cavity size with flattened septum in systole and diastole along with bowing of interatrial septum toward the left supporting ECG findings of right ventricular strain (, ). Due to suspected massive pulmonary embolism (PE) alteplase 50 mg was given intravenously over 120 min. This resulted in significant improvement of hemodynamics, perfusion indices and oxygenation within next 12 h to the extent that hypotension resolved despite being on high PEEP protocol for ARDS.\nAfter 24 h, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite being off sedation. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of head revealed multifocal infarcts of both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres with associated mass effects concerning for acute ischemic infarcts. Follow-up CT in 12 h revealed hemorrhagic transformation and anticoagulation with heparin was held. Due to concern for cardioembolic phenomenon, FoCUS with agitated saline was done that showed early right to left shunt consistent with patent foramen ovale (PFO) (, ). Doppler ultrasound of legs did not reveal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). No evidence of atrial fibrillation was noted on prolonged cardiac monitoring. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome workup was negative.\nPatient remained intubated for 20 days due to poor mental status but was eventually successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. She was discharged on apixaban 5 mg BID for PE. After 5 months of continuous physical, neurological and nutritional improvement, TEE was done which confirmed the PFO ( and ).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 63 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.45 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.45/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**63 * 1.012 = 40.53. Hence, the GFR value is 40.53 ml/min/1.73 m².",

Ventilation was performed with a tidal volume of 450 ml, tidal rate of 30/min and positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Norepinephrine 1.5 µg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 U/hr, dopamine 30.4 µg/kg/min, and dobutamine 57 µg/kg/min were initially provided at the intensive care unit (ICU) and continuously administered. On admission, measurement taken at the radial artery showed blood pressure (BP) of 86/56 mmHg, central venous pressure (CVP) of 16-17 mmHg, cardiac rate of 120/min, oxygen saturation (SO2) of 93% and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) of 28 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis performed at 21:30 indicated a pH of 7.310, partial pressure (tension) of oxygen (PO2) at 60.7 mmHg, CO2 tension at 30.4 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SO2) of 91%, bicarbonate 15.0 mmol/L, base excess -10.3 mmol/L, Na+/K+/Cl- 134.1/4.4/115 mmol/L, hemoglobin at 7.8 g/dl, hematocrit (Hct) 23% and a blood glucose (sugar) level of 144 mg/dl. Following measurements taken at 21:40, when BP was 45/32 mmHg; CR, 112/min; SO2, 88%; PETCO2, 20 mmHg, an increase of fluid intake was established and 20 µg of epinephrine was administered. Thereafter, systolic blood pressure increased to 50-60 mmHg and the surgeon was consequently informed of the patient's critical condition, which initiated the start of the operation. Shortly in to the procedure, when pulsation of the carotid artery was palpable and weakened, 500 µg of epinephrine was injected, but this administration proved to be ineffective. At 21:45, the patient displayed asystole (cardiac standstill) and 1,000 µg of epinephrine was administered, which made no effect and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was consequently initiated. During continuous CPR, additional administration of epinephrine at of the following doses, 1,000 µg, 2,000 µg, and 2,000 µg was given. Until the occurrence of aortic occlusion, a fluid therapy of 1,000 ml of crystalloid solution and 1,000 ml of colloid solution was delivered. The BP of the patient did not respond to the fluid therapy since it was maintained at 52-58/36-40 mmHg, SO2 at 50-70%. At 22:00 when perfusion was performed simultaneously with aortic occlusion, CPR was terminated. The perfusion was completed at 22:17 and the liver was retrieved at 22:45 ().\nThe retrieved liver was transplanted to a male recipient in a state of hepatic coma, who was 38 years old, 75.8 kg in weight, 181.1 cm in height, and with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of 40. While his femoral arterial and venous pressure were monitored, a 9-Fr catheter (Advanced venous access HF®, Edwards Life Science Corporation, USA) and a multifunctional pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo CCO/SvO2, Edwards Life Science Corporation, USA) were placed into the internal jugular vein. At the onset of operation, dopamine 5.0 µg/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.05-0.1 µg/kg/min were injected. At 3 hours and 20 minutes after anesthesia induction, the patient entered the anhepatic phase, and 1 hour and 3 minutes later, reperfusion was performed. At the time of reperfusion, an abnormality appeared when the patient's BP decreased to 78/40 mmHg, CR to 75/min, but the administration of epinephrine 50 µg once and atropine 0.5 mg twice restored these to normal states. Intra-operative BP, except for the reperfusion period, was maintained at a relatively stable state of BP between 95-130 and 44-70 mmHg, CR between 75/min and 98/min (). After the liver transplantation, which lasted 7 hours-and-50 minutes, was completed, the patient's vital signs indicated BP 109/59 mmHg, CR 86/min, and SO2 100%. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), when dopamine 5.0 µg/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.3 µg/kg/min were administered as vasopressor. All of the intra-operative intakes of fluid and blood products included 4,900 ml of crystalloid solution, 880 ml of 5% glucose solution, 1,500 ml of colloid solution, 1 unit of packed leukocyte-depleted red blood cells (RBC), 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 6 units of cryoprecipitates, 500 ml of 5% albumin, and 1,108 ml of retrieved blood by cell saver, while the urine output was 115 ml; ascites, 3,000 ml; blood loss, 2,000 ml.

He was having type 2 diabetes mellitus since 7 years and was on oral hypoglycemics. He was also hypertensive since 18 months and was on nifedipine retard 20 mg TID, clonidine 100 μg TID, metoprolol 50 mg OD, and furosemide 40 mg BID. During preoperative evaluation, the patient was New York Heart Association Class III having a history of breathlessness and dyspnea on exertion. Jugular venous pressure was raised. Mild ascites was present without evidence of organomegaly. His daily urine output was around 500 ml. His 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesia, and LVEF of 15% with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure = right atrial pressure + 44). Coronary angiography was normal. His routine blood investigations were within normal limits except hemoglobin of 8.7 g% and a serum creatinine of 6.9 mg/dl on preoperative visit. His creatinine value before starting of dialysis 21 months earlier was 9.4 mg/dl. His chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly with cardiothoracic ratio of 0.7. On airway examination, his mouth opening was 3 cm with normal dentition. He was Mallampati Class 2 with a full range of neck movements and a thyromental distance of 7 cm. All antihypertensive medications were continued as prescribed. Heparin-free hemodialysis was done 24 h before surgery. A written informed consent for surgery and anesthesia was obtained along with high risk of cardiovascular events and postoperative mechanical ventilation.\nIn the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula was secured in the right upper limb and 5-lead ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry were attached, and baseline hemodynamic parameters were noted. A 20-gauge arterial cannula was secured in right radial artery under local anesthesia (LA), and FloTrac™ monitor for cardiac output monitoring was attached. A functioning brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula was present in the left upper limb. Right internal jugular vein was cannulated under ultrasound guidance, after adequate LA infiltration for continuous central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring and vasopressor administration if required. His baseline IBP was 155/92 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 64/min, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and CVP was 23 mmHg. Dobutamine and epinephrine infusions were kept ready for use. Under strict aseptic precaution, epidural was placed in left lateral position at T10–T11 interspace after adequate LA infiltration, with a 16-gauge Tuohy epidural needle using the loss of resistance technique. Correct placement of epidural catheter was confirmed by a negative test dose of 3 ml lignocaine 2% with 15 μg of epinephrine. A total of 15 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% with 50 μg fentanyl was given in epidural space in “graded” doses of 5 ml every 10 min while assessing the pulse, blood pressure changes, respiration, and keeping constant verbal command to the patient. IV dobutamine was started at the rate of 5 μg/kg/min after giving the first bolus of epidural and titrated according to IBP response. After 30 min of bolus doses, sensory level was T8 with adequate motor paralysis. A continuous epidural infusion at rate of 6 ml/h of 0.5% bupivacaine with 2 μg/ml was started for maintenance. Surgery was allowed to start, and IV infusion of propofol was started at the rate of 50 mg/h for sedation. Supplemental oxygen was given by Venturi mask (FiO2 0.5). Goal-directed fluid therapy was given based on pulse pressure variation. Cardiac output, cardiac index, and stroke volume variation were also considered during fluid therapy and inotropes titration. A total of 2 L of crystalloid and 200 ml of 20% albumin were given intraoperatively. One unit of packed red blood cell and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were also given. Surgery lasted for 6 h and total loss was around 800 ml including 500 ml of ascites and 350 ml blood. At the time of release of cross-clamp, his IBP was 157/94 mmHg, HR was 67/min, and CVP was 12 mmHg. Urine output was adequate after release of cross-clamp. All vital parameters, blood gasses, blood sugar, and electrolytes remained within normal range throughout surgery. Epidural infusion was stopped on starting on skin closure. Renal transplant was completed uneventfully. Patient was shifted to postanesthesia care unit with vital near baseline and urine output at 250–300 ml/h. Postoperative analgesia was maintained by continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with 2 μg/ml fentanyl at the rate of 6 ml/h along with IV paracetamol 1 g TID. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Later patient developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with Type 2 respiratory failure with mixed acidosis.\nHis presenting blood gases showed profound acidemia. pH - 7.057, base excess - 7.5, PCO2-11.23 kPa, PaO2-13.7 kPa on FiO2-50%. P: F ratio was around 200. His inflammatory markers were high (total leukocyte count [TLC] 26 × 109/L, procalcitonin 11.2 mcg/L, C-reactive protein [CRP] 104 mg/L) and renal functions worsened and he was oliguric.\nHe was started on appropriate antibiotics and noninvasive ventilation. He was started on noradrenaline infusion to target mean arterial pressure of 70 mm Hg. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration instituted to manage his renal failure with an aim for a negative fluid balance of 1.5 L. Hemodynamic monitoring was done by pulse-induced contour cardiac output.\nAfter 12 h, he continued to be acidotic profoundly because of raised PaCO2-10.86 kPa. Failure to remove CO2 was noted despite being on non-invasive ventilation. His chest was clear B/L on auscultation. His vasopressors requirements increased as he continued to be acidotic due to high PaCO2 levels.\nExtracorporeal carbon dioxide removal veno-venous (Hemo Lung Respiratory Assist System: Alung Technologies Inc.) was instituted at that time to normalize his acid-base imbalance, which was due to increased PaCO2.\nHe was started on pump flow - 0.56 L/min, sweep flow - 10 L/min, sweep FiO2-1.0, CO2 removal at 6-10 L of sweep flow, which removed CO2 about 75-100 ml/min. His activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was targeted around 1.2-1.6. Platelets, fibrinogen, and Hb monitored periodically to recognize any signs of bleed/disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nSweep flows were adjusted according to blood gas CO2 values. Heparin infusions were initially avoided as he was coagulopathic, but added later during weaning phase.\nIt was noted that after starting him on ECCO2R, pH improved to 7.30 as PaCO2 normalized to around 6.5 kPa.\nHe was continued on non-invasive ventilation on bi-level positive airway pressure MODE with aim Sats >90%, pH >7.3, R/R <30. His inflammatory markers improved. TLC was 16 × 109/L, CRP 46 mg/L, procalcitonin was 0.9 mcg/L enteral nutrition was continued throughout.\nExtracorporeal carbon dioxide removal and adjusting sweep flows and actually to be able to monitor CO2 levels removed per minute helped to adjust his ventilator settings accordingly.\nContinuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was turned off as renal function recovered.\nUnfortunately patient had sepsis relapse. He turned acidotic and work of breathing worsened. Sweep flows on veno-venous CO2 removal were again adjusted as per demand. This helped to manage the patient without increasing any support on conventional ventilation and hence no increased sedation/paralyzing agents were required.\nExtracorporeal carbon dioxide removal was turned off after 20 days when his infection was treated adequately.\nSweep flows were gradually taken down to minimal levels to provide minimal CO2 removal. A decrease in every liter of gas flow was made only after when a patient had been stable on it for 6-10 h. A sweep flow of 4 L/min accounted for 80 ml/min as opposed to about 45 ml/min when on 1 L/min.\nHe developed critical illness related weakness and had a prolonged weaning and rehabilitation by extensive physiotherapy, after which he was successfully decannulated and discharged from the intensive care unit. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

He was normally very active, hiking and rock climbing frequently, however he felt as though he had not been able to hike at his normal brisk pace. The day before his presentation, while finishing a long hike, he had become lightheaded and nearly lost consciousness, stating that he rapidly lowered himself to the ground. His girlfriend, who accompanied him, confirms that he did not fully lose consciousness. The patient cannot recall any preceding symptoms; he specifically denies having chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, or any focal neurological deficits. Several seconds after the episode, the patient felt completely back to his recent baseline. He had no persistent lightheadedness.\nUpon returning from the hike that day, the patient visited a local urgent care. He had no symptoms at the time and was noted to have dry mucus membranes on physical exam. His work-up there included complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and electrocardiogram, which were normal. The patient was diagnosed with dehydration and presyncope and was discharged to home.\nAt home, the patient rehydrated orally and went to bed. He awoke at 02:00 with recurrent symptoms so he drove to the emergency department.\nUpon arrival, the patient was placed on a monitor in the triage room and was noted by the triage nurse to be in complete atrioventricular dissociation. During triage, the patient briefly lost consciousness, during which time the triage nurse noted an eight-second ventricular pause on the cardiac monitor. External pacer/defibrillator pads were placed and the patient was brought back to a trauma room. On initial physician interview, the patient noted continued lightheadedness but denied chest pain, palpitations, jaw or arm pain, nausea, edema, or shortness of breath. He also denied headache, focal weakness, and speech or coordination changes. He reported no fever or respiratory symptoms in the past week.\nThe patient had no past medical or surgical history. He received all routine pediatric vaccinations and screening studies. He was not prescribed any medications and denied using any supplements or alternative medical treatments. He had no known drug allergies. He had a family history of hypertension in his mother and coronary artery disease in his father, diagnosed in his 60s. There was also a family history of colorectal cancer in his father. He denied any known family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrhythmias, although he admitted to not being well informed about his family history. The patient was a non-smoker, drank one to two alcoholic drinks per week, and denied recreational or intravenous drug use.\nDuring the travel history, the patient did report having traveled extensively throughout the United States over the past year to participate in outdoor recreational activities. He recalled camping in the Northeast region two months ago, after which he had some low grade fever and a red rash on his right shoulder. He described the rash as circular and gradually enlarging. He did not recall any central clearing. The fever and rash spontaneously resolved and he did not seek medical attention for these. He had no further symptoms after that, up until 48 hours prior to his presentation to the emergency department.\nA complete review of systems was obtained and was negative. Vital signs were blood pressure: 112/65; heart rate: 62; respiratory rate: 12; temperature: 98.5.\nPhysical exam revealed a fit-appearing young male who was mildly diaphoretic but was alert and fully oriented and in no acute medical distress. Cardiac exam demonstrated a borderline bradycardic rate. There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no extremity edema and peripheral pulses were symmetric. There was no jugular venous distention. Breath sounds were clear to auscultation and symmetric. His abdomen was soft and non-tender. The remainder of the physical examination was without noted abnormalities. Notably, there was no rash, focal weakness, or joint tenderness or effusion. He had a normal neurologic exam.\nAn electrocardiogram was obtained rapidly after the patient’s admission to the emergency department. This showed atrioventricular (AV) dissociation with accelerated junctional rhythm. Axis was normal. There were no acute ST elevation or depression and no T wave abnormalities. See Figure for the ECG.\nComplete blood count in the emergency department showed a white blood cell count of 8,500 per microliter (reference range 3,800-11,000 per microliter), hematocrit of 41.2% (reference range 39-50%), and a platelet count of 248,000 per microliter (150,000-400,000 per microliter). White blood cell differential was within the hospital laboratory’s established normal limits.\nA comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a glucose of 97 mg/dL (reference range 65-99 mg/dL), creatinine of 0.80 mg/dL (reference range 0.7-1.30 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL (reference range 7-18 mg/dL), sodium of 140 mmol/L (reference range 136-145 mmol/L), and potassium of 3.6 mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.1). Transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were within normal laboratory reference ranges.\nUrine toxicology screen was negative for any drugs of abuse.\nA point-of-care troponin was not elevated outside of the reference range. A repeat troponin was checked 4.5 hours later and was also within normal limits.\nSubsequent serial ECGs demonstrated periods of junctional rhythm slower than atrial rhythm, confirming third-degree heart block.\nIntervention\nThe patient was given a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and was admitted to a cardiac telemetry floor. A transvenous pacemaker was placed. Blood was sent for serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. He was started on empiric therapy with 2 grams of IV ceftriaxone given once daily on the presumption of Lyme carditis as well as maintenance IV normal saline.\nSerial laboratory evaluation each morning consisted of a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. These laboratory studies did not fall significantly outside of reference ranges throughout the course of the patient’s hospitalization. Serial electrogardiograms were obtained and showed persistent complete atrioventricular block in the first three days of his hospitalization. Additional diagnostic studies that were ordered during the patient’s hospital stay included an echocardiogram, which revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness, normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55-60% (reference range 55-60%), and no significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. There was no evidence of diastolic dysfunction to suggest infiltrative cardiomyopathy. There was no pericardial effusion. A thyroid stimulating hormone level was checked and was 1.210 microIU/mL (reference range 0.358- 3.740 microIU/mL).\nOutcomes\nThe patient’s enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and subsequent Western blot serology testing returned positive for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, suggesting active infection. He remained in the hospital for 10 days during which time his cardiac telemetry monitoring showed gradually lengthening intervals of Mobitz I second-degree heart block. Following seven days of treatment, there were no further intervals of third-degree heart block. Upon discharge from the hospital, pacemaker wire was removed. The patient followed up with a family medicine physician one week following his discharge. ECG done at that time showed normal sinus rhythm. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 27 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.8^(-1.154) * 27^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=115.959. Hence, the patient's GFR is 115.959 mL/min/1.73m².",

Her husband had died 10 days previously, causing her severe emotional stress. Her heart rate was 112 beats/min, and blood pressure was 102/68 mm Hg. A grade 4/6 holosystolic murmur was audible at the apex. An electrocardiography showed prominent ST-segment elevation in leads V2–5 (). Troponin I was 1.3 ng/mL (reference range, <0.12 ng/mL) and creatine kinase was 141 U/L (reference range, 55–170 U/L). Bedside echocardiography showed an akinesis from the mid to apical left ventricle, but preserved systolic function within the basal segment (). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58% and flow acceleration in left ventricular outflow tract was not noted by color Doppler. Right ventricular systolic function was also reduced, particularly within the mid to apical segments. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 59 mm Hg. In addition, a ventricular septal defect resulting from apical septal rupture with a left-to-right shunt was noted (). Pericardial effusion was not present in the initial echocardiographic assessment. Angiography demonstrated no significant stenosis of the epicardial coronary arteries (), suggesting the diagnosis of ventricular septal rupture complicated by takotsubo cardiomyopathy with right ventricular involvement.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room 3 hours after admission for emergency repair of the ventricular septal rupture. However, immediately before induction of anesthesia, her blood pressure suddenly collapsed with pulseless electrical activity. After 5 minutes of resuscitation, cardiac activity was restored. Sternotomy was done, and the pericardium full of fresh blood was found. Both left and right ventricles had necrotic changes with hemorrhage (). Cardiopulmonary bypass was established and the apex was incised. Ventricular septal wall rupture was confirmed (). Also, another rupture within the right ventricular free wall measuring 20×18 mm was noted (), which had led to the cardiac tamponade that presented in the operating room. Patch closure of the ventricular septal rupture with right ventriculoplasty was performed. Pathological examination of the ruptured ventricular septum revealed disrupted myocytic integrity in multiple foci with lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and myocytic necrosis (). Although she was sent to the intensive care unit after weaning of the cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was required because of refractory shock 4 hours after surgery.

    "problem": "<Context> A 67-year-old Japanese man with advanced colon cancer with liver metastasis presented with bowel obstruction in May 2007 and underwent emergency surgery (left hemicolectomy with D3). A pathological examination revealed a well-to-moderately differentiated, type 2, intermediate-type tubular adenocarcinoma (70 × 40 mm) arising in the descending colon. The lesion was associated with pathological evidence of serosal invasion (pSE), an infiltrative growth pattern (INFβ), moderate lymphatic invasion (ly2), and moderate venous invasion (v2). There was no involvement of the proximal margin (pPM0, 150 mm), no distant metastasis (pDM0, 120 mm), and no lymph node metastasis (0/27). A liver biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma.\nHis medical history indicated a gastric ulcer in 2003. We did not note any personal or family history of kidney disease, autoimmune disease, or asthma. He worked in an office. He had smoked five cigarettes per day for 50 years and drank alcohol socially.\nOne month after the operation, he initially received hepatic arterial infusion therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from June through to October 2007. After receiving five courses of simplified l-leucovorin plus 5-FU (sLVFU), he had strangulating intestinal obstruction and underwent emergency surgery in January 2008. Second-line treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) was started in October 2008 and terminated in May 2009 as a result of renewed progression. From June 2009 he received third-line treatment with modified leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin regimen (mFOLFOX-6) plus bevacizumab. However, in June 2010 a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed progression of liver metastasis again. Considering that our patient had already been treated with the combination chemotherapies FOLFIRI and mFOLFOX-6 and the wild-type RAS status of his primary tumor, treatment with bi-weekly panitumumab monotherapy (500 mg/m2) was initiated on July 20, 2010. He had no adverse events after the initial course of panitumumab. A second course of panitumumab was administered on August 2, 2010. General malaise, leg swelling, and skin rash developed 2 days after the second cycle of panitumumab (2 weeks after the initial dose), and around August 18 the symptoms intensified. However, he had neither joint pain nor abdominal pain during the period. When he visited the out-patient department on August 23, bilateral edema of his legs and bilateral purpura of his forearms had progressed (Figs. and ). Blood tests showed grade III acute renal failure with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 33.8 mg/dL and a creatinine level of 3.10 mg/dL, as well as nephrotic syndrome with a total protein (TP) level of 4.5 g/dL and an albumin level of 1.4 g/dL. Urine analysis showed blood (3+) and urinary protein (4+). Several acanthocytes and 5–9 white blood cell casts were observed in the urinary sediment. He was therefore immediately admitted to our hospital. His height was 164.cm and body weight was 50 kg (6 kg increase in 3 weeks). His blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg and pulse rate was 84 beats per minute. His body temperature was 36.4 °C. The results of his physical examination were relatively unremarkable, except pretibial pitting edema and diffuse purpura on his whole body. There was no neurologic abnormality including mononeuropathy multiplex.\nHe underwent examinations for differential diagnosis from other kidney diseases: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), C3, C4, cryoglobulin, proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA), and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA). However, no clinically significant findings were obtained (Table ). Because oliguria (urine volume, 400 mL/day) was present after admission, an albumin preparation (12.5 g twice daily) and furosemide were administered for 3 days. Treatment with prednisolone 40 mg/day was begun immediately. After this treatment, his urine volume increased to 1100 mL, and the generalized edema improved slightly. A skin biopsy was performed to evaluate the purpuric lesions on the lateral lower region of his left leg on August 25, and LCV was diagnosed (Fig. ). A drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) was performed as a supplementary test to differentiate the cause of the drug-induced allergic symptoms. However, the results of all tests were negative for both cetuximab and panitumumab (Table ). As local therapy, betamethasone ointment and moisturizer were applied topically. The skin lesions gradually improved, and only crust remained on August 31. Around August 27, his urine volume decreased to 600–900 mL/day, and edema and his body weight increased. Thus, treatment with indapamide was started on August 31. After this treatment, his urine volume increased to 1500–1700 mL/day. The urinary protein excretion decreased from 7.14 g/day to 6.83 g/day during hospitalization, indicating that he had nephrosis. His kidney function gradually improved after his BUN and creatinine reached peak levels of 60.5 mg/dL and 3.36 mg/dL, respectively, on August 30. His levels of BUN and creatinine on September 9 were respectively 40.1 mg/dL and 2.01 mg/dL, indicating a tendency to decrease, and he was discharged from our hospital on September 13 (Fig. ).\nBecause the nephrotic syndrome continued, he was hospitalized for kidney biopsy on November 1, but it was cancelled due to emerging hydronephrosis. His serum magnesium level was 1.5 mg/dl (1.9–2.5 mg/dl). This case was discussed at a multidisciplinary conference of the Cancer Institute Hospital. Rechallenge of panitumumab was denied considering the increasing nephrotoxicity. The best supportive care was eventually provided. On November 11, our patient agreed with our decision to provide supportive care. He died of colon cancer progression in May 2011, 48 months after the onset of initial symptoms and after having received 9 months of best supportive care. A needle necropsy of the kidney was performed approximately 40 minutes after death. Global sclerosis was found in 6 of approximately 50 glomeruli, and fibrous crescent formation was recognized in 3 glomeruli, while the components of other glomeruli had collapsed (Figs. and ).

Four months earlier, the patient had developed generalized myalgia without clinical weakness that was predominant on both thighs (pain score 7/10) and a low-grade fever. Two months later, the fever persisted and he complained of difficulty climbing stairs. He had occasional knee pain on both sides and weight loss from 65 to 60 kg in 3 months. One month later, he developed rapidly progressive dyspnea and noticed a new-onset periorbital rash, which brought him to the hospital.\nVital signs on admission were temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, pulse rate of 119 beats/min, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, and severe hypoxemia (SpO2 74% in room air). Physical examination revealed erythematous to violaceous patches on the periorbital areas (heliotrope rash), red to violaceous papules (Gottron's papules) with overlying ulcerations and crusts on the right 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint and 4th proximal interphalangeal joint, ill-defined violaceous erythema (Gottron's sign) on the left 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint, tender erythematous papules, and ulcerations on the palmar surfaces of the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands and medial aspect of the index fingers. Livedo reticularis was also detected on the palmar surfaces of the index fingers of both hands, and erythematous linear plaques (flagellate erythema) were noticed on both inner thighs (Fig. ). Mechanic's hands were not found. Chest auscultation was notable for bilateral basal lung crepitation. He had bilateral proximal muscle weakness grade IV/V at both the upper and lower extremities. No signs of arthritis were detected. Other findings were unremarkable.\nLaboratory investigations showed mild anemia (Hb 9.1 g/dL), a white blood cell count of 10,370/µL (neutrophils 85%, lymphocytes 8%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 3%), a C-reactive protein level of 3.53 mg/dL, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 68 mm/h. Creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were high at 505 mg/dL and 105 IU/L, respectively. Alanine aminotransferase was normal (20 IU/L). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was 1:80 (fine speckle type and cytoplasmic pattern), and anti-Ro-52 was positive. Anti-MDA5 antibody was positive, whereas anti-Jo-1, anti-Mi-2, and anti-SRP antibodies as well as other myositis panels were negative which were detected by Western blot.\nAn anteroposterior chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltration at both lungs. A high-resolution CT scan of the chest revealed multifocal areas of ground glass attenuation and alveolar opacity throughout the lung parenchyma and predominately at the peripheral and peribronchiolar regions (Fig. ). Electromyographic findings suggested inflammatory myositis. Histopathological findings from the right 3rd knuckle revealed interface changes with sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate (Fig. ).\nThe patient was diagnosed with RP-ILD with anti-MDA5 antibody-positive classical DM. He was initially treated with intravenous hydrocortisone (300 mg/day) and 125 g of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day) divided over 5 days due to impending respiratory failure. However, his condition deteriorated. He developed new-onset fever on the 7th day after admission and a chest X-ray showed progressive alveolar infiltration. Meropenem was administered intravenously at a dose of 1 g every 8 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures were negative for microorganisms. Pathological transbronchial biopsy results revealed benign bronchial epithelium with fibrinous material and no malignancy. Dexamethasone was administered intravenously at a dosage of 20 mg per day in addition to the patient's existing treatment regimen. However, his status progressed towards respiratory failure, and he required ventilator support. He died due to respiratory failure on day 22. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "3",
    "Upper Limit": "3",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 36.7 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 119.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 10370.0 count/µL. To convert 10370.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 10370.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 10370000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 30.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.

White blood cell count was 19,500 cells/mm3 with 92.8% neutrophils.\nThe sonographic examination did not reveal any findings consistent with acute appendicitis exception for periceaceal fluid and it showed a normal intrauterine pregnancy. With a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a laparotomy was done via a paramedian incision in the right side of the abdomen. Appendix was erythematous and appendicectomy was performed.\nThe histopathological examination of the appendix revealed acute appendicitis with extensive deciduosis of the appendiceal wall of all the three layers. There were also glandular structures among the decidua which were positive with cytokeratin 7, while the adjacent appendicial mucosa was negative. The diagnosis was endometriosis and decidiosis of appendix and acute appendicitis.

Three days after admission, she developed a fever and hypoxia, complaining of dyspnea. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities, but thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of bronchial walls, suggesting bronchitis (Fig. ). Her respiratory distress progressed despite empirical antibiotic therapy. She was transferred to our section 25 days after admission. A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows and a cavity in the right middle lung field, while thoracic CT demonstrated consolidation along with obstructed bronchi. Distal portion of the obstructed bronchi showed cystic bronchiectatic lesions in the right upper lobe (Fig. ).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 61 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 1.35 mg/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.742. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 1.35^(-1.154) * 61^(-0.203) * 1 * 0.742=39.867. Hence, the patient's GFR is 39.867 mL/min/1.73m².",

He also reported low-grade fever (100.7 F) with associated chills. He was initially seen at a Level 1 trauma center where he underwent a Doppler investigation of the lower extremities with negative findings. Blood work at the time was reported normal. A worsening induration and swelling of the left lower extremity prompted him to seek further work-up. An inquiry into past medical and family history was non-contributory. He had a history of hernia repair and tonsillectomy. Social history was significant for recreational marijuana and cocaine use in the past. He was homosexual and reported being sexually active with one male partner and inconsistent contraception use. The patient denied weight loss, night sweats, recent travel, recent major illness or surgery, or steroid use. On admission, he was afebrile (98.8 F) and tachypneic (18 breaths per minute). A blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air were documented. The physical examination revealed a mildly enlarged spleen and confluent erythema of the bilateral lower extremities that were tender to touch. Blood work showed a normal white blood count of 7.33X109/L, hemoglobin of 15.6 mg/dl with marked thrombocytopenia, and platelet count of 51X109/L. An aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 289/L, alanine aminotransferase of 372/L, and direct bilirubin of 0.22 umol/L confirmed transaminitis. The D-Dimer level was 14,000 ng/ml. The venous duplex of the lower extremities showed extensive thrombosis in the left peroneal (Figure ) and thrombosis of the left popliteal (Figures -).\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast revealed borderline splenomegaly of size 13 cm. Extensive investigations eventually showed evidence of an active CMV infection with CMV-Immunoglobulin M (IgM) seropositivity (>240.0 AU/mL) and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serology was positive for the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) (368 U/mL). He received a platelet transfusion with symptomatic improvement. He was discharged home on Eliquis 5 mg twice daily; however, he returned to the hospital a week after with new symptoms. He reported right lower leg pressure-like pain that was exacerbated with walking. Doppler revealed right great saphenous vein superficial thrombophlebitis along with unchanged findings in the left leg. He was initially switched to Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily; and on clinical improvement, he was later discharged on Apixaban 5 mg twice daily. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are reported to be present and so three points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 3 = 3. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 3 + 3 = 6. The patient's heart rate is 81.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and so the score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 6. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 6. The patient not been diagnosed with pulmonary embolis (PE), but the patient has previously been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 6 + 1.5 = 7.5. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 7.5. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 7.5.

She was managed in an outside facility for 1 week on amlodipine, erythropoietin, imipenem, HD and other supportive care for CKD. On presentation, patient was conscious, well-oriented with a heart rate of 116 beats/min regular, non-invasive blood pressure of 108/66 mmHg, temperature of 100.2°F and respiratory rate of 34/min with accessory muscles being used. On chest examination, bilateral normal vesicular breath sounds were heard with decreased air entry and occasional coarse crepts in the right lower zone. Her laboratory workup on the day of admission and subsequently is shown in . Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation/collapse with pleural effusion. Blood and urine cultures were sent, which were sterile. She was managed in the medical intensive care unit on antibiotics and non-invasive ventilation. She was continued on injection imipenem 500 mg twice daily (BID), which she had already received for 2 days prior to admission. On the 3rd day of admission, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated with a significant rise in total leukocyte count (TLC) up to 28,600/mm3. Repeat blood cultures were sent and injection teicoplanin and injection caspofungin added empirically. Next day, a provisional report of gram-negative coccobacilli in blood was received, which was later confirmed to be Acinetobacter baumannii. Injection colistin in a dose of 1 million units (MU) (80 mg colistimethate sodium) intravenous (i/v) once daily (OD) following a loading dose of 2 MU was started. Her fever and TLC started decreasing gradually from the 7th day onward. Caspofungin was de-escalated on receiving culture reports and imipenem was stopped after 10 days of therapy. Patient continued to improve clinically with off and on low-grade fever. She was continued on almost alternate day HD.\nOn the morning of 16th day of admission, patient had sudden onset of abnormal facial twitchings, which were mainly circumoral and initially limited to the neck. The seizures were controlled with short acting benzodiazepine in the form of injection midazolam 1 mg i/v stat. She was loaded with injection phenytoin 1 g i/v on neurologist's opinion, followed by 100 mg i/v BID. But in the same evening, patient had another episode of seizures, which were generalized tonic clonic and got relieved with injection midazolam 1 mg + 1 mg i/v bolus. Levirecetam 1 g i/v stat followed by 500 mg i/v BID was added by the neurophysician. Her laboratory workup reflected no acute metabolic derangements. Liver profile was normal. Neuroimaging of the brain (magnetic resonance imaging) and electroencephalography were normal. Nerve conduction velocity to rule out critical illness neuropathy was also done. To rule out meningitis as a cause for fever and seizures, lumbar puncture was performed and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was found to be clear, with normal pressure and CSF biochemistry was within normal limits (CSF glucose = 56 mg/dl (corresponding Random Blood Sugar = 92), proteins = 37, TLC = nil).\nFurther search for any offending drug as a cause for seizures was made. Imipenem which is a potentially seizure inducing drug, was stopped around 1 week before the occurrence of focal seizures. Excluding all other possible causes, colistimethate which is a seizure-threshold lowering drug, was considered to be the sole possible causative agent for seizures. As the patient had improved clinically, colistin was stopped on the occurrence of seizures. Fresh blood cultures were sent after 48 h of stopping antibiotics, which were sterile. Patient had no recurrence of seizures at any point of time after stopping the drug. The antiepileptics were tapered after 1 week of starting the treatment. The patient was shifted to the ward and was finally discharged in a fair condition after 33 days of hospital stay. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department after one week of repeated bouts of crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, which became bloody on the day of arrival. There was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.\nHe was evaluated several times in the Emergency Medicine Department during the previous three months, with various abdominal complaints that resolved after symptomatic relief without further investigation. The patient reported no additional symptoms or relevant personal or familial medical history. He worked as a bus driver, smoked cigarettes for many years, and did not drink alcohol regularly.\nThe patient reported daily usage of “Mr. Nice Guy” for the last few months but denied use of any other drugs or supplements. Consumption of SCs was via smoking, and he denied other means of administration such as oral or intravenous. This information was validated by collateral anamnesis of visiting friends.\nIn the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with initial BP recordings of 159/100 mmHg, regular heart rate of 99 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for intense borborygmi and mild abnormal tenderness. Initial blood work showed leukocytosis of 20,000 cells/mcL with neutrophilia (80%) and normal hemoglobin (15.1 grams/dL). Biochemistry, including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver, and pancreatic enzymes, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and urine toxicology screen was slightly positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines but negative for other screened drugs including THC, opiates, and cocaine. Upon repeated questioning, patient once again denied use of any other stimulant including amphetamines, besides “Mr. Nice Guy.” White cell count increased to 28,000 cells/mcL six hours later, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed without IV or PO contrast enhancement was unremarkable. Over the next four days the patient continued to complain of intermittent episodes of crampy abdominal pain with episodic diarrhea, followed by pain-free periods during which he strolled freely around the hospital, admitting that he was still smoking “Mr. Nice Guy,” provided to him by his friends. Additional toxic screens were not performed during hospitalization due to lack of the patient's cooperation. Leukocytosis gradually resolved. Blood, stool, and urinary cultures were negative and other laboratory data were unremarkable, with the exception of hypophosphatemia (0.5 mmol/L, normal = 0.8–1.4) and increasing C-reactive protein (22 mg/dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL). During his hospitalization we abstained giving the patient medications from the family of benzodiazepines, potent opiates, and any medications which involve potential future addiction.\nOn the fifth hospitalization day, an abdominal X-ray, taken during a bout of abdominal pain, demonstrated dilated small bowel loops without features of intestinal obstruction or perforation, consistent with paralytic ileus. Later that day, the pain subsided and the patient requested to take a walk around the hospital, as our internal medicine ward regulations permit stable patients to leave their rooms. Obviously, hospitalized patients are not permitted to use any form of drug or medication not provided to them by hospital staff.\nHowever upon returning from his walk, the patient admitted that he had once again consumed “Mr. Nice Guy” with one a friend who came to visit him. Routine checkup of vital signs revealed elevated blood pressure 180/110 mmHg with a heart rate of 120/min, without fever. Six hours later, he developed sudden extreme abdominal pain and was found to be in profound shock vomiting “coffee ground” material. Physical examination revealed abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness compatible with peritonitis, and laboratory evaluation disclosed hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and worsening kidney function. An emergent surgical intervention was considered for an evolving abdominal catastrophe, but the patient quickly went into pulseless electrical activity with subsequent cardiac arrest.\nA request for autopsy was declined by the patient's family, but a postmortem CT scan one hour after death revealed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis of the entire small bowel, right colon and sigmoid, gas in the portal system, and blood vessels, with free air and unclear fluid in the peritoneal cavity (Figures and ). These findings were consistent with acute intestinal perforation most probably due to a nonobstructive mesenteric infarction (NOMI) as the cause of death. There was no evidence of single vessel infarction, rather of diffuse ischemia, possibly due to splanchnic vasospasm. Air in the aorta, right ventricle, and biliary tract were conceivably postmortem changes. Urinary toxic screen sampled during hemodynamic resuscitation was positive for methadone, THC, and benzodiazepines, but negative for cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines. Unfortunately, due to technical failure, the final urine sample was not sent for confirmatory mass spectrometry testing. </Context> <Question> What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? </Question>",

The patient denied having any upper respiratory symptoms, rash, or joint pain. The patient also denied having any gross hematuria, foamy urine, or any other urinary symptoms. The patient’s history included GPA, diagnosed by a renal biopsy 2 years ago, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diverticulosis requiring colostomy.\nHis medication at the time included simvastatin, lisinopril, azathioprine, and insulin. His azathioprine was reduced from 200 mg/day to 100 mg/day 6 months before presentation. He had recently lost his job and insurance, and denied smoking, alcohol use, or any substance abuse. On physical examination, he was afebrile. His blood pressure was 99/51 mmHg, pulse was 74 beats/minute, and respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, height was 165 cm, and weight was 97 kg. He was in no apparent distress. The patient’s lungs were clear, heart sounds were regular without any murmur, rub, or gallop, the abdomen was soft, and no edema or skin rash was present.\nLaboratory data revealed the patient’s blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to be 73 mg/dL and serum creatinine (Scr) 5.2 mg/dL with otherwise normal electrolytes, hemoglobin 12.7 mg/dL, platelets 257,000/mm3, albumin 3.5 mg/dL, and normal liver enzymes. Two years prior to current presentation his Scr level was 1.5 mg/dl. Urinalysis showed large protein, large blood, many dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood cell casts. The urine protein to creatinine ratio was 2.03 mg/mg. Renal sonogram revealed kidney sizes of 11.3 cm and 10.6 cm on right and left kidneys, respectively, without any evidence of obstruction and an unremarkable bladder with no significant postvoid residual volume.\nThe patient was started on high dose pulse methylprednisolone intravenously (1 g/day for 3 days), and his azathioprine dose was increased to 200 mg/day. His serology showed normal complement titers, negative hepatitis profile, and mildly elevated rheumatoid factor at 24 IU/ml (normal <14). ANCA serology showed proteinase-3 (PR3) antibody (anti-PR3, cytoplasmic c-ANCA) reactive at low levels −4.1 (<1.0 reported as negative) and negative myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody (anti-MPO, perinuclear p-ANCA). Anti-GBM titers were negative.\nBased on clinical presentation and the patient’s past medical history, it was presumed that the most likely cause of worsening renal function was a relapse of GPA. However, very low levels of anti-PR3 antibodies, and the questionable duration of the progression of the patient’s renal disease prompted the nephrology team to proceed with a repeat kidney biopsy.\nThe kidney biopsy showed focal segmental necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, with weak linear staining of IgG, which was not seen on previous biopsy. Out of 19 glomeruli examined, nine showed complete or near complete global sclerosis. Crescents were seen in eleven of 19 glomeruli. The other biopsy findings included moderate tubular atrophy, moderate interstitial fibrosis with inflammation, and moderate arteriosclerosis ( and ). The pathologist reported findings suggestive of moderate disease activity and moderate chronicity. Although the biopsy indicated some evidence of chronic disease, there was still significant active disease that should be treated. Provided that the disease process responded to the treatment, there was a possibility of at least partial recovery of renal function.\nThe biopsy findings presented a treatment dilemma. The patient had a history of GPA and initially presented with PICGN and crescentic glomerulonephritis with negative IF findings 2 years previously (). At that time, he was treated with pulse methylprednisolone followed by 6 months of oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide, which successfully induced remission. His renal function had improved; Scr decreased from 3.1 mg/dL to 1.5 mg/dL and proteinuria decreased from 2.3 g/day to <500 mg/day. He was then switched to maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine. At the time of his initial presentation, his anti-PR3 level was >100 U/ml. After initial induction therapy, anti-PR3 level was reduced below assay limits and remained negative during follow up.\nThis patient was treated with pulse dose of intravenous methyl prednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days followed by maintenance oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day. He was also treated with monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg). Three months later, the patient had partially responded with proteinuria decreasing to 800 mg/day and Cr stabilizing to 2.8 mg/dL. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 47 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 5.2 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 165.0 cm, which is 165.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.65 m. The patient's weight is 97.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 97.0 kg / (1.65 m * 1.65 m) = 35.629 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 35.6, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 165.0 cm, which is 165.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 64.961 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (64.961 (in inches) - 60) = 61.41 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 61.41 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 61.41 kg + 0.4 * (97.0 kg  - 61.41 kg) = 75.646 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 75.646 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 47) * 75.646 * 1) / (5.2 * 72) = 18.79 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 18.79 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 48-year-old man (80 kg, 177 cm, and ASA PS-IV) was scheduled for emergent below-knee amputation after he was found to have left lower limb diabetic foot ulcer associated with whole foot gangrene and osteomyelitis. His medical history was significant for uncontrolled type II DM and New York Heart Association class IV stage C CHF secondary to ischemic 4-chamber DCM. Electrocardiography analysis showed sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and inferior myocardial infarction. Bedside examination of transthoracic echocardiography prior to surgery estimated left ventricular EF of 27% and noted minimal tricuspid regurgitation. Posteroanterior chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly with signs of left chamber enlargement and grade-2 pulmonary edema. Bilateral lower limb arterial duplex ultrasonography was suggestive of peripheral arterial disease with mild atherosclerotic changes. Other organ function and biochemical disturbances included mild hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis (). His medications on admission included NPH insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, furosemide, and metoprolol. We estimated his subjective metabolic equivalent of tasks ≤4, revised cardiac risk index (Lee criteria) of >11%, and glomerular filtration rate of 21,518 mL/min/1.73m2.\nAt admission to the operation theatre, he was diaphoretic with cold and clammy hands and feet. After informed consent, he was taken to the operating room where standard monitors were placed, and supplemental oxygen was administered via nasal cannula. A urinary catheter was placed to monitor urine output. The patient was then placed in a sitting position for spinal anesthetic administration.\nThe spinal block was performed by a consultant anesthetist between the level of L3 and L4 interspace using the midline approach. The skin was anesthetized with 3 mL of lidocaine 2%, and a 24-G Quincke spinal needle was used to administer a mixture of heavy bupivacaine 7.5 mg in 1.5 mL volume (BUPICAN™ HEAVY, 20mg/4mL ampule, Baxter Pharmaceuticals, India), dexmedetomidine 4 μg in 1 mL volume (Precedex™, 400 μg/100 mL vial, Hospira, USA), and fentanyl 25 μg in 0.5 mL volume (Fentanyl®, 100 μg/2 mL ampule, Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceutica, Germany). Phenylephrine, 50 µg, was administered intravenously, just before the subarachnoid block, as prophylaxis to postspinal hypotension. Immediately after the intrathecal injection, the patient was placed in the lateral position for 15 minutes, with the operative side down and the head 15°up. Then, he was turned supine and properly positioned for surgery. The sensory assessment revealed a loss of pinprick sensation to the level of T11 dermatomes and extending to both posteriorly and anteriorly.\nHeart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were recorded before spinal anesthesia (baseline: mean blood pressure, MAP 87 mmHg; heart rate, HR 92 bpm; and SpO2 at room air, 90%), just after spinal anesthesia, and then every 5 minutes till the end of surgery. Hemodynamic stability was maintained throughout surgery (ie, MAP, 75–92 mmHg; HR, 80–100 bpm; and average hourly urine output, 50 mL). His SpO2 and skin temperature were maintained between 95% and 99%, and 36.0–36.8 °C, respectively. The rapid blood sugar test result at admission to operation theatre was 235 mg/dL. Intravenous regular insulin infusion (1unit/hour) was administered over an hour of the procedure, and the serum glycemic level was kept below 180 mg/dL. The surgical procedure was done by an orthopedic surgeon with 6 years of experience and lasted 80 minutes without any apparent complications. He received a total of 950 mL crystalloid and 350 mL packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The total estimated blood loss (EBL) was 350 mL, and the urine output was 150 mL. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit for further monitoring and then transported to the medical ward. He did not experience any side effects of perioperative therapy, including nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hypotension, or postdural puncture headache during his postoperative course. Postoperative laboratory exam on day one revealed hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 35%; platelet, 185 ×103 cells/µL; white blood cells, 15.6 ×103 cells/L; creatinine, 0.97 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 42 mg/dL; K+, 3.7 mmol/L; Na+, 160 mmol/L; and Cl−, 112.8 mmol/dL.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian man. He is 1.61 meters tall and weighs 66 kilograms. After working as a car mechanic for 36 years, he had been receiving disability benefits for 11 years. He was working part-time as a caretaker averaging 10 hours per week until two and a half years ago. At the age of 35, the patient began having bouts of severe back pain approximately twice a year. When these episodes occurred, he took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for three to four weeks for pain relief. At the age of 40, lumbar spondylolisthesis was diagnosed by radiography. At the age of 50, he suddenly developed severe right hip pain. He suffered from substantial arthrosis on the right side, which was treated with a total hip replacement one year later.\nThree years ago, he began to develop neurological symptoms in both hands. Pain and loss of function of his fingers prevented him from working as a caretaker. The pain radiated from his neck bilaterally down to his fingers and was described as parasthesia-like in nature. He also complained of weakness in his hands. Left hand digit flexion was classified as J1 and right hand as J4. Digit extension was classified as J4 on the left and J2 on the right and abduction on the left was classified as J0 and on the right as J1. The patient also had difficulty walking (Nurick 4, EMS 10/18) as he had to support himself using his surroundings in order to stand upright and was unable to walk unassisted. He was referred to a neurologist by his general practitioner who in turn referred him to a neurosurgeon. Radiographs (Figure ) magnetic resonance imaging (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a spondylolisthesis between C7 and T1. Using the Meyerding classification [], which was initially developed for grading the degree of lumbar spondylolisthesis, the patient would have been diagnosed with a cervico-thoracic spondylolisthesis of the second or third degree. The spondylolisthesis, measured using the method developed by Kawasaki et al. [], was 13 mm. In view of the special nature of the case, a collaborative treatment between neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons was favored and subsequently implemented.\nThe surgical management was performed as follows:\nThe patient was placed in the supine position. The intervertebral disk at C7-T1 was exposed using blunt dissection. The disk was then removed to the point of the ligamentum flavum. A subsequent resection of the lateral parts of the intervertebral discs significantly mobilized the spondylolisthesis.\nThe wound was closed and the patient was rotated to the prone position. First, the dislocation between vertebras C7 and T1 was reduced while positioning the head.\nSubsequently, the lateral masses were prepared from a dorsal approach between C5 and T3. Then, lateral mass-screws were inserted into C5 and C6. We had noticed considerable laxity between C6 and C7. In addition, C5 and C6 were naturally fused and we decided to include them in the instrumentation. There was also a rigid displacement between C7 and T1.\nBicortical screws were then inserted into the transverse processes of T2 and T3. These were inserted into at least two segments from both sides in divergent directions. The length of these screws was 10 to 12 mm, with a diameter of 3.2 mm.\nThis was followed by a laminectomy. Since the roots of C7 and C8 were exposed, the lateral masses of C7 and C8 had to be resected. Longitudinal rods were placed. Proper reduction in lordosis and the preservation of a 5 mm intervertebral space between C7 and T1 were confirmed by radiograph. Set screws were used to fix the instrumentation in the desired position. Chips of cortical and cancellous bone were placed lateral to the longitudinal rods.\nThe dorsal wound was then closed. The patient was again rotated to the supine position to reopen the ventral wound. Now, instead of the previously seen displacement, a large gap was visible between C7 and T1. The endplates between C7 and T1 were milled and the ligamentum flavum was resected using punches. Then, the spinal canal was exposed completely, using a Caspar opener.\nSubsequently, a Harms basket, filled with autograft bone chips, was inserted into the intervertebral space. Three drains were placed and the wound was closed. For prophylactic infection control, the patient was perioperatively given intravenous 1.5 g cefuroxime twice a day for the next four days. Intraoperative and postoperative radiographs (Figure and ) were taken to confirm correct placement of the instrumentation.\nFollowing the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. His vital signs were stable enough for him to be transferred to the general postoperative recovery ward on the fourth postoperative day. Eleven days after surgery, the patient left the hospital and entered an orthopedic and neurologic rehabilitation program.\nThe pain and parasthesias in his fingers resolved after the operation. Two months postoperatively, his ability to walk had noticeably improved after completing his rehabilitation program (Nurick 3).\nToday, two years postoperatively, the patient is able to walk without assistance (Nurick 2). Flexion of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J3 and as J5 on the right hand. Extension of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J4 and as J2 on the right. Abduction was graded as J4 for his left hand and as J2 for his right hand (EMS 14/18). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

His daily urine volume was approximately 300 mL and his abdomen was distended, with a maximum circumference of 105 cm. His weight and height were 63.8 kg and 170 cm, respectively. The laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.2 g/dL; BUN, 38 mg/dL; creatinine, 6.5 mg/dL; and total cholesterol, 206 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed markedly enlarged polycystic kidneys bilaterally and multiple liver cysts. The renal volumes, appearing as an ellipsoid on CT images, were 3,309 mL and 3,173 mL on the right and left sides, respectively, according to the following formula: (π/6) × (length × width × depth).\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient. A TAE was performed in March 2007. This procedure was performed through the right femoral artery using the Seldinger technique, which involved the insertion of a Terumo guide wire (Radiofocus M; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and a 5-Fr Cobra catheter (Cook, Bloomington, IN) under local anesthesia. The arteriogram before the renal TAE showed bilateral narrowing (left > right), and stretched the renal arteries. Absolute ethanol was injected via the coaxial catheter (Progreat microcatheter system; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) into the right renal artery. Seven mL of ethanol with 2 mL of Lipiodol was used to detect reflux of the radiolucent ethanol. After 5 minutes, the right renal artery was completely embolized. At this time, a renal TAE was performed on one side of the kidney only because the patient will only want to repeat the procedure on the contralateral kidney if the results of the first TAE are good. A second TAE of left renal artery was performed in March 2008. The procedure was the same as the previous TAE. At this time, we used a balloon catheter to prevent the reflux of the ethanol. After performing a selective renal arteriography, a 5-mm-diameter, 2-cm-long, 3-Fr balloon catheter (Savvy; Cordis Europe, Roden, The Netherlands) was positioned in the main renal artery. With the balloon inflated, 3 mL of ethanol was slowly injected for complete embolization ().\nAfter the TAE, the patient experienced abdominal and lower back pain, which were ameliorated with opioids (pethidine - 25 mg three times a day for 2 days). The patient developed a fever the next day, which was controlled by a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. He recovered and was discharged three days after the TAE. The poor oral intake due to abdominal distention was relieved one month after the TAE. Over the course of an 18 month follow-up period, the patient's general condition improved. His kidney size decreased bilaterally after the TAE (). The abdominal maximum circumference was reduced from 105 to 80 cm. The patient's dry weight decreased from 63 to 58 kg and hypertension did not develop. The daily 300 mL urine output did not change.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 19 year old male who was 204.2 cm in height and weighted 145.15 kg. He was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 128/80, left arm, seated. Otherwise healthy, he experienced gradual right wrist pain over the hamate and did not report a traumatic golf injury, although he does play golf. He had a previous fracture to the left hamulus over one year prior [Fig ] that apparently occurred on an attempt at ball strike with a sand wedge while playing golf, in which he struck a rock just behind the ball. In that case, immediate pain was noted and the condition was misdiagnosed by a sports medicine clinic prior to evaluation by the chiropractic clinician in his chiropractic office []. The left hook had to be excised due to failure of fragment fusion after plaster splinting, which was applied for six weeks for the treatment of a suspected scaphoid fracture. The patient's wrist injury healed post-surgically with some complications involving a subsequent navicular-lunate ligament tear and the patient was eventually able to return to golf.\nSince there was a previous misdiagnosed fracture to the left wrist in this case, the patient called the chiropractic office first. Due to his history, computed tomography [CT] was ordered immediately following an examination which demonstrated mild to moderate pain on all right wrist movements, point tenderness over the hamate and previous difficulty in obtaining a carpal tunnel view on plain film x-ray.\nThe CT scan revealed a complete, slightly displaced fracture of the hook of the right hamate with associated soft tissue edema [Fig ]. A referral to an orthopedic surgeon was made to assess the need for excision of the hook of the hamate. Because of prior history, the patient elected to have the hook excised without conservative therapy.\nBilateral fracture of the hamate is uncommon. In a case-report by Bray, Swafford and Brown in 1985 [], their search of the literature found only 19 cases prior to 1977. In this case, the left wrist had an apparent mechanism of injury classic for fracture at this site, as it is the left hamate that contacts the butt of the club in a right-handed golfer []. However, the right wrist did not have this mechanism of injury. This may suggest some preexisting condition of the hamate in this patient. A condition known as hamate bipartite affects the hamate in some patients [,]. This condition, which is thought to be the result of fibrocartilagenous union between the body and hook of the hamate, typically causes symptoms in this part of the wrist and is characterized by a weak or ununited appearance of the hook that can be detected on CT or plain film radiographs [].\nHamate bipartite tends to be suspected in cases where there is no history of trauma or surgery to the wrist []. In our case, there was a denial of traumatic golf injury to the right wrist but was apparent in the left.\nFeatures of hamate bipartite according to Pierre-Jerome & Roug [] include;\n• Bilaterally similar bipartite hamulus\n• No sign or history of traumatic wrist injury or edema or soft tissue changes suggestive of un-united fracture\n• Equal size and uniform signal intensity on MRI evaluation of each part\n• Absence of progressive degenerative changes between the two components of the hamate or elsewhere in the wrist\n• Smooth, well corticated and rounded margins of the hamate and un-united hook.\nSymptoms were noted in the case of the left fracture immediately upon the patient's dubbed ball strike and only surgical excision relieved the pain []. Additionally, the original radiological report accompanying the images of the right wrist was indicative of fracture and not otherwise. The attending radiologist noted degenerative changes within the right wrist, separation of the naviculolunate interspace and 1–2 mm of separation of the hook from the body of the hamate. There was also some indication of a possible previous fracture of the capitate noted by the radiologist, which would further indicate possible previous trauma to the right wrist. However, the patient denied previous trauma.\nHamate fractures represent approximately 2–4% of all fractures involving the carpal bones []. Fractures involving the hamulus, or hook, represent one of the two groups of fractures of the hamate []. Norman and others documented three radiographic signs suggestive of fracture of the hamulus []. According to their criteria, the most frequently encountered and most important feature is the lack of visualization of the hook. On the dorsovolar view the hamulus is seen en face super-imposed over the hamate and demonstrates a cortical ring shadow known as the \"eye sign\" []. A blurry or indistinguishable appearance of the \"eye\", as well as sclerosis of the hamulus, seen associated with nonunion, represents the other two radiographic features that suggest fracture of the hook [,].\nVarious radiographic positioning techniques can prove useful in the evaluation of potential hamate fractures. These may not always be of diagnostic quality due to limited range of motion experienced by the patient as a result of pain, especially in acute or subacute fractures []. Moreover, these fractures are commonly overlooked on standard radiographic studies of the wrist due to the lack of specific physical exam findings and a low index of suspicion []. Conventional radiographic examination of the wrist usually consists of the dorsovolar view, which demonstrates the radiographic signs first described by Norman and colleagues as discussed previously, as well as the lateral and medial oblique projections [].\nThe use of the carpal tunnel view [Fig ] has increased in an attempt to better elucidate the presence of a hamulus fracture []. Originally described by Gaynor and Hart [,], it is set with the patient positioned such that the flexor surface of their forearm lies against the film with slight radial rotation and the long axis of their hand is made as vertical as possible. The central ray is directed toward the palmar surface distal to the base of the third metacarpal with 25–30° of tube angulation. The patient may use their other hand or some other appropriate device to hold their wrist in this extended position [].\nThe \"radial-deviated, thumb-abducted lateral view\" [Fig ] is considered by some authors, an underused technique that adequately demonstrates the hamate between the thumb and index finger and clearly displays fractures of the hamulus []. This radiograph is performed by positioning the patient with their forearm in neutral and the medial aspect of their wrist against the film cassette. Their thumb is fully extended and abducted and their wrist deviated radially. This position results in maximum widening of the index finger-thumb web space []. The central ray is directed at the center portion of the index finger and thumb web. Alternately, the radial deviation can be excluded and a 15° tube angulation, oriented toward the wrist, can be used []. Bhalla and colleagues consider this view a cost-effective and time-saving adjunct to traditional wrist series when fracture of the hook of the hamate is suspected.\nThe hamulus, which develops from its own ossification center, may fail to fuse with the body of the hamate []. This normal variant is referred to as the os hamuli proprium and may be difficult to differentiate from avulsion fractures of the hamate hook []. In equivocal cases, computed tomography [CT] of the wrist is an effective advanced imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis of hamulus fractures due to its ability to provide an image that is orthogonal to the plane of the hamulus base fracture, while avoiding the possibility of superimposed anatomical structures [,]. In fact, it has been suggested that it is pointless to obtain plain films when hamulus fracture is suspected clinically and that CT should be the initial imaging modality chosen [].\nMoreover, with the newer generation spiral CT multiple imaging planes can be obtained after a single scan []. With complete fractures, CT clearly reveals an osseous fragment demonstrating indistinct and irregular apposing cortical margins separated from the parent bone []. Incomplete fractures exhibit partial cortical disruption without osseous fragment separation. Additionally, internal joint derangements, such as injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex, may be found in association with fracture of the hamulus depending on the mechanism of injury such as a fall on the outstretched, pronated arm. Physical examination of these patients reveals tenderness between the pisiform and ulnar styloid on the ulnar border of the wrist []. Typically, however, there would be no indication of fracture in these patients and imaging would make the differential diagnosis []. Further, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] is, in the opinion of the authors, most effective in determining the presence and extent of these injuries. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 35-year-old Indian male with no significant medical history. He was born in Tamil Nadu, India, and emigrated to Singapore six years prior to presentation. He returns to India annually to visit friends and relatives, both in small towns and villages in rural areas with farms housing farm animals. He drank well water and ate local food during these trips back to India. He had no known personal or contact history of tuberculosis.\nHe presented to medical care after a first-onset seizure which was witnessed by his wife. The seizure was described as jerking movements of all four limbs, associated with uprolling of eyeballs, and a transient loss of consciousness lasting ten minutes. There were no preictal symptoms. Postictally, he was drowsy for another ten minutes and was unable to recall the events upon regaining consciousness. Prior to this seizure, he was generally well and did not report any constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or anorexia.\nOn examination, he had a low-grade temperature of 37.8 degrees centigrade. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. Neurologic examination did not reveal any focal neurologic deficits, and there were no localising signs of infection. Laboratory investigations were significant for leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 × 109/L. There was no peripheral eosinophilia. Renal and liver function tests were normal, as were routine biochemistry and serum electrolytes. Noncontrasted computed tomography scan of the brain revealed an ill-defined eight-millimetre hypodense lesion with a hyperdense rim in the left basal temporal region, with mild surrounding vasogenic edema. MRI of the brain further delineated this as a solitary ring-enhancing lesion measuring 1.2 by 1 centimetre (). Postcontrast images showed thick smooth peripheral enhancement, but no clearly-defined scolex or mural nodule consistent with a typical viable cyst of neurocysticercosis. Skull base artefacts limited assessment of the contents on diffusion-weighted images.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus serology was nonreactive. Two sets of blood cultures were negative, as was serum Cryptococcal antigen. Three sets of stool microscopy for ova, cyst, and parasites did not pick up any parasites. As there was no available serologic test for cysticercosis at our centre, a serum sample was sent to an overseas reference centre for serologic testing with an antibody-detecting ELISA-based assay.\nAfter discussion with the managing neurosurgical team, the patient opted for brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis, in view of the broad range of differential diagnoses based on the neuroradiologic features. A left minicraniotomy was performed and identified a slightly hardened pale white to yellow lesion, with a milky white exudate upon breaching the lesion capsule. The entire cyst was excised and sent for histology and microbiologic evaluation.\nHistology demonstrated granulomatous inflammation featuring aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells lining the fibrous cyst wall, accompanied by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis. Features characteristic of a cysticercus were absent, and no viable larva was identified (). No fungi or acid-fast bacilli were found on Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) and Ziehl–Neelsen histochemical stains, respectively, and no Toxoplasma organisms were identified on immunohistochemical staining.\nMicrobiologic testing did not identify causative organisms on Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, fungal smear, acid-fast smear, and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\nIn view of nonspecific histologic and radiologic features, no definite diagnosis was made at this point. As histology showed granulomatous inflammation, and tuberculosis is endemic in the region, empiric combination ant-tuberculous therapy and a tapering corticosteroid regimen were initiated after discussion and shared decision-making between the patient and medical team while awaiting further diagnostic tests.\nWhile awaiting ELISA serologic assay results, which later returned positive for cysticercosis, residual brain tissue was sent to the National Public Health Laboratory, a tertiary reference laboratory, for further molecular diagnostic testing. 25 milligrams of brain tissue was minced on dry-ice, lyzed in ATL buffer with proteinase K, and DNA was extracted using QIAmp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Taenia solium-specific PCR targeting the pTsol9 repeat element based on a previous paper by Almeida and colleagues [] and a pan-Cestoda PCR targeting a fragment of the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA – 12S rRNA) genes based on a paper by Le and colleagues [] were attempted. Capillary electrophoresis on QIAxcel® Advanced System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equipped with DNA Fast Analysis Kit displayed multiple bands of expected sizes (120 bp, 280 bp, and 440 bp), corresponding to the amplification of 1, 2, and 3 repeat unit(s) of the pTsol9 element, respectively () and a single band of 810 bp for the 16S rRNA-12S rRNA genes. Purification, bidirectional Sanger sequencing, alignment, and cross-checking of the sequences were performed as previously described [] for the 16S rRNA-12S rRNA PCR products. A consensus fragment of the 16S rRNA-12S rRNA genes (808 bp) was obtained, compared by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against GenBank (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA), showed 99.6% similarity (805/808) with sequence [AB086256], and thus ascertained that detected DNA was from T. solium. The sequence has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number (MT772182).\nUpon molecular confirmation of neurocysticercosis, antituberculous therapy was stopped. The patient completed 14 days of oral albendazole together with a rapid taper of corticosteroids and has remained well since on subsequent follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Centor Score? </Question>",

They brought him to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center emergency room. His initial vital signs showed a temperature of 100 ºF, blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute. He was noticed to have disseminated, vesicular-pustular rash all over his body at different stages of healing and crusted skin eruption on his anterior neck and submandibular area (Figures -).\nPatient’s neurological exam revealed that he was alert and oriented to self only, had a right-sided upper and lower facial droop. The patient also had impaired hearing on the right side. The muscle strength was 5/5 throughout. The patient had normal reflexes and the sensation was intact. The remainder of his physical exam did not show any other abnormal findings. Computerized tomography of the head without contrast showed no acute intracranial pathology. Subsequently, the patient had a lumbar puncture done in the emergency room which revealed a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a white blood cell count of 849 cells/uL with lymphocyte predominance (72%), glucose of 39 mg/dl and protein of 364 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. CSF sample was sent for a varicella-zoster polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as well. His chest X-ray was clear without any infiltrates. His initial laboratory investigations are summarized in Table .\nA presumptive diagnosis of disseminated VZV with encephalitis was made according to the patient's skin lesions and CSF analysis. Therefore, he was started on intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every eight hours and admitted to the general medical floor under contact and airborne precautions. Patient’s varicella zoster PCR from the CSF sample came back positive. Patient mental status improved rapidly within 48 hours of treatment and he became alert and fully oriented. On eye exam, the patient had diplopia with right gaze, and it was determined that he had a right sixth cranial nerve palsy. He had deficits in right sided cranial nerves VI, VII, and VIII evident by impaired right eye abduction, right sided facial weakness, as well as impaired hearing. This constellation of findings is likely secondary to Ramsay Hunt syndrome with multiple cranial nerve involvement. Intravenous acyclovir was continued, and the patient started taking prednisone 50 mg orally for five days for the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. He was also found to have otitis externa and was prescribed ciprofloxacin with dexamethasone otic drops. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain without contrast found nonspecific white matter lesions in the high left frontal lobe measuring approximately 8 mm but otherwise no mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarct (Figure ).\nThe patient’s mental status came back to his baseline on day three. The patient’s rash had crusted on day six hence the isolation precautions were discontinued. He started ambulating without any difficulty and facial paralysis resolved by day eight. He was safely discharged home after nine days of hospital stay with oral acyclovir 400 mg tablets three times daily for 21 days and prednisone 50 mg tablets daily for three days. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is not reported to be the #1 diagnosis and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. The patient's heart rate is 105.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 1.5. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 1.5. Hemoptysis is not reported in the patient note and so we assume that it is missing from the patient, keeping the total score at 1.5.

This was accompanied by tender swellings in the groin bilaterally that resulted in difficulty walking. She was seen by her family practitioner twice during this episode and was prescribed a 1-week course of oral augmentin, followed by another 5-day course of oral moxifloxacin. Despite the antibiotics, her condition continued to worsen. Ten days from fever onset, she developed a rash over her hands and legs, associated with circumoral numbness. However, no swallowing problems or breathing difficulty were reported. Over the next 4 days, the rash spread to her face and ears associated with markedly tender swellings in her armpits.\nShe has no significant medical history and has been working in Singapore as a domestic helper in the same household for the past 8 years. She is single, with no sexual activity nor gynecologic issues. She has not returned to her native country in the past 3 years.\nOn systemic enquiry, there was no loss of weight or night sweats, no joint swellings or arthralgia, no alopecia, and no dry eyes or mouth. There was also no personal or family history of autoimmune disease (Fig. ).\nOn examination, her temperature was 39.2°C, pulse rate 120 beats per minute, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. The significant findings concerned the skin, which revealed an erythematous papulonodular eruption scattered over the extensor surfaces of both upper and lower limbs. There were multiple indurated plaques on the face over the nasal bridge, the brow, the outer maxillary area and both earlobes and pinna. This was associated with ankle edema, tender, enlarged and matted cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The differential diagnoses considered included tumid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, cutaneous amyloidosis, lymphoproliferative disease, Sweet syndrome, and Hansen disease.\nRoutine investigations revealed leukocytosis of 36.18 × 109/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 80 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L. HIV testing, antinuclear antibody, C3, C4, and double-stranded DNA levels were normal. Serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 316 IU/L with otherwise normal liver transaminases. Her albumin level was 34 g/L.\nIn view of the persistent high fever and multiple enlarged lymph nodes with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, she underwent a computed tomography scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which showed no intra-abdominal or hepatobiliary source of infection, or abscesses, but revealed multiple enlarged and necrotic lymph nodes in the axilla and inguinal regions consistent with the initial examination findings.\nCloser examination revealed bilaterally thickened greater auricular nerves and lateral peroneal nerves, which further raised the suspicion of leprosy. Complete examination of the central nervous system did not reveal any sensorimotor loss (Fig. ).\nSkin biopsy was performed and histological examination showed a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, sparing the epidermis. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, foamy macrophages, and neutrophils. Some of the inflammation involved the nerves and adnexal structures. Large numbers of acid-fast bacilli were identified on Fite and Ziehl-Neelsen stains. These features are consistent with the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum leprosum.\nShe was started on multidrug therapy comprising of rifampicin, dapsone, and doxycycline. Due to the lack of availability of clofazimine, doxycycline was used as an interim third agent before clofazimine was obtained 2 days later. Prednisolone at 1 mg/kg was also started empirically. Of note, there was no evidence of Lucio phenomenon as she did not have skin erosions or ulcers.\nShe has recovered well on follow-up in the outpatient setting.

A thorough physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness on deep palpation without any other signs of peritonitis. The laboratory examination was unremarkable except for polymorphonuclear leucocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count, 15 × 103/μL; neutrophils, 86%) and an elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/dL; reference range, 0-5).

Abdominal ultrasound examination was unremarkable.\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed for a suspected perforation in the upper GI tract. A few adhesions caused by previous cholecystectomy and appendicectomy were observed without any signs of peritoneal irritation or peritoneal fluid. The stomach and duodenum were fully mobilized, and the lesser sac was explored, but no evidence of perforation was found in the distal esophagus, stomach or duodenum. The small bowel and colon were also examined, but no leakage was observed.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 90.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 15000.0 count/µL. To convert 15000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 15000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 15000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg.

His prescription medications included tamsulosin, benazepril, simvastatin and a multivitamin. He denied any intake of calcium supplements, antacids or vitamin D. He was a former alcoholic (quit 10 years ago) and an ex-smoker (quit 15 years ago) and denied any illicit drug use. He was recently discharged from the hospital a week ago when he was admitted for acute kidney injury, secondary to dehydration.\nAll his initial vital signs in the emergency department were within normal limits and physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of 2+ pitting pedal edema bilaterally up to mid-shins. Serum chemistries showed a white blood cell count (WBC) 15,600/mm3 (normal: 4,000-11,000), neutrophil count 12,900/mm3 (normal: 1500-8,000), monocytes 1300/mm3 (normal: 200-1000), hemoglobin 17.4 g/dl (normal: 13.5-17.0), red blood cell 5.78 million/mm3 (normal: 4.3-6.0), platelets 145,000/mm3 (normal: 150,000-450,000), blood urea nitrogen 31 mg/dl (normal: 7-20), creatinine 1.76 mg/dl (normal: 0.6-1.2), calcium 12.2 mg/dl (normal: 8.5-10.2), albumin 3.1 g/dl (normal: 3.5-5.5) [corrected calcium 12.9 mg/dl], total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dl (normal: 0.1-1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 73 IU/L (normal: <40), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 33 IU/L (normal: <56), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 218 IU/L (normal: 44-147), NT-proBNP 638 pg/ml (normal: <450) and serum procalcitonin 35.6 ng/ml (normal: <0.5).\nChest radiograph done in emergency department showed bilateral infrahilar and basilar subsegmental atelectasis though early infiltrate versus aspiration could not be ruled out. Ventilation-perfusion nuclear medicine scan showed low probability of pulmonary embolism. The patient was empirically started on piperacillin-tazobactam by ED physician for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia and admitted to the hospital for further care.\nSuspecting the possibility of congestive heart failure, the admitting physician started patient on intravenous furosemide, ordered an echocardiogram and added intravenous vancomycin for empiric coverage as well. Echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction of 60% with no valvular abnormalities. Nephrology service was consulted by the admitting physician for management of hypercalcemia. Nephrologist ordered studies to evaluate the cause of hypercalcemia, discontinued furosemide and gave calcitonin to treat hypercalcemia. Investigative workup for hypercalcemia revealed parathyroid hormone level < 6 pg/ml (normal: 15-65), 25-hydroxy vitamin D 45 ng/ml (normal: 30-100), 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D 17 pg/ml (normal: 18-72), angiotensin converting enzyme level 11 U/L (normal: 9-67), 24-hour urinary calcium excretion 153 mg/dl (normal: 50-300), normal IgA, IgG, IgM levels, serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminemia without any evidence of monoclonal protein, serum and urine immunofixation was negative. Ordered serum parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) revealed elevated levels of 62 pg/ml (normal: 14-27 pg/ml). As hypercalcemia did not respond to calcitonin, the patient was given intravenous pamidronate (twice). As his leukocytosis continued to worsen (19,100/mm3) along with procalcitonin (38.15 ng/ml) despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics for one-week, infectious diseases service was consulted and leukemia/lymphoma flow cytometry panel, peripheral blood smear was ordered to evaluate for hematologic malignancy. Infectious disease physician discontinued vancomycin and ordered Indium-111 labeled whole body WBC scan which showed no abnormal areas of increased tracer uptake to suggest a focus of infection. Leukemia/lymphoma flow cytometry was negative for any specific phenotypic abnormality. Peripheral blood smear showed presence of neutrophilia without any evidence of malignant leukocytes.\nMeanwhile, the patient went in to acute hypoxic respiratory distress with wheezing and so pulmonary service was consulted which transferred the patient to ICU, started him on intravenous methylprednisolone and initiated non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (bi-level positive airway pressure - BiPAP). As PTHrP had come back elevated, the patient underwent a CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, which showed a hypodense mass in the right posterior lobe of liver measuring 9.3 cm x 8.3 cm in size with presence of moderate abdominal and severe pelvic ascites (Figure ). The patient underwent paracentesis with removal of 2.6 L of straw-colored fluid. Ascitic fluid did not show any malignant cells or evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ultrasound of the liver showed a 10.9-cm mass in the right lobe of liver along with portal vein occlusion. Hematology and oncology service was then consulted. Oncologist did not recommend anticoagulation for portal vein occlusion and ordered tumor markers evaluation which showed alpha-fetoprotein 14.7 ng/ml (normal: <8.7), CA 19-9 2907 U/ml (normal: < 35), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 5.2 ng/ml (normal: <3.4). A possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma was discussed with the patient and he was scheduled to undergo CT-guided liver biopsy. Broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued after 10 days of administration as they neither lowered procalcitonin nor WBC count. Blood, urine and other body fluid cultures remained negative during the entire hospital stay. Either partly because of being on intravenous steroids and/or due to underlying disease process, patient’s WBC count peaked at 40,100/mm3 during this hospital stay. Though he presented with polycythemia, his peak hemoglobin and hematocrit during admission was 19.7 g/dl and 57%. Serum erythropoietin level was found to be elevated 21.4 mIU/ml (normal: 2.6-18.5).\nPatient’s liver profile worsened during his ICU stay with serum bilirubin escalating up to 12 mg/dl, ALP 470 IU/L, AST 429 IU/L, ALT 362 IU/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.8, albumin 1.8. MRI liver/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) abdomen was ordered which did not show any evidence of biliary obstruction. Viral hepatitis panel came back negative as well. Liver biopsy revealed moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of hepatobiliary origin reported as primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma under current clinical settings (Figure ). Immunohistochemical stains revealed CK Oscar(+), CK7(+) (Figure ), CK20(-) (Figure ), Villin(+) (Figure ), CDX2(-) (Figure ), TTF-1(-), Napsin A(-), PSA(-) and NKX3.1(-).\nOncology service recommended no chemotherapy at the moment as the patient was thought to be too frail. Three weeks after his admission to the hospital, his blood pressure dropped in ICU requiring initiation of norepinephrine infusion. A temporary hemodialysis catheter was inserted and sustained-low efficiency dialysis (SLED) was initiated as well. Given his dismal prognosis in the setting of malignancy and multi-organ failure, a detailed discussion was held with the patient and his family members when it was decided to proceed with comfort care options and hospice. The patient was discharged to hospice the following day. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "11.818",
    "Upper Limit": "13.062",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L. The patient's concentration of AST is 429.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of ALT is 362.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of platelets is 145000.0 count/µL. To convert 145000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 145000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 145000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 145000000000.0/(10^9) = 145.0 billion platelet counts per liter. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (80 * 429.0)/(145.0 * sqrt(362.0)) = 12.44. Hence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 12.44.",

After placement of regular monitors, anesthesia was inducted with thiamylal, fentanyl and atracurium, and the patient was then intubated with 5.0 mm uncuffed endotracheal tube. A 5 Fr Uniblocker tube (Fuji Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted under the guide of a 2.0 mm-out diameter (OD) fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) in the lumen of endotracheal tube. (Fig. ) The position of Uniblocker was checked by the bronchoscope to make sure the upper marker of the balloon was 1 to 2 mm just beneath the carina. (Fig. ) The balloon was gradually inflated with air until the breathing sound disappeared over left lung field. Two episodes of balloon dislodgement occurred before the surgical procedure per se, the first when changing position to the left decubitus position, and the second when inserting the surgical instrument into the port, presenting as oxygen desaturation and loss of corresponding lung collapse, respectively. In both episodes the position of Uniblocker was examined by bronchoscope and was adjusted inwards to the proper position. Then the surgical lung remained well collapsed all the time through resection of the left lower lobe, around 4 hours long. The ventilator was set at volume control mode with FiO2 100%, tidal volume 8 ml/kg, I.E. ratio 1:1.5, and respiratory rate 24 /min. End-Tidal CO2 was around 28 to 38 mmHg, and SpO2 was always above 97% during the rest course of one lung ventilation. At the timepoint when the surgeon stapled the bronchus, the bronchial balloon was deflated and the Uniblocker withdrawn into the tracheal tube to avoid incorporation with the surgical staple line.[ The whole surgical procedure was then finished smoothly, and two-lung ventilation was resumed, with a total one lung- ventilation period of 245 minutes and blood loss of 20 ml without blood transfusion. The Uniblocker tube was removed immediately after he was sent to the intensive care unit. The entotracheal tube was removed by the patient himself one day later, but was reinserted hours later for O2 desaturation. After 10 days of ICU care, the endotracheal tube was successfully weaned. Though subglottic tracheal stenosis occurred at 17 days, deemed to be due to tracheal re-intubation, this problem was solved by laser coagulation surgery, and he was discharged home on day 19 Table . </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Blood gas analysis revealed pH: 7.26, pO2: 86 mmHg, and bicarbonate: 20.2 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed gas in the intrahepatic biliary ducts. No obstructive pathology was found to mesenteric blood flow on Doppler USG. CT without intravenous contrast was performed because of abnormal renal function tests. CT revealed gas near the stomach, among colon segments (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, PSI) and intrahepatic biliary ducts in central and left hepatic lobe (hepatic portal venous gas, HPVG) (Figure , Figure , respectively).\nThe patient was referred to another hospital that had an intensive care unit and started conservative treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Twelve hours after treatment, his general condition did not improve and signs of diffused peritonitis were observed on abdominal examination. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Necrosis was found in the terminal ileum and the entire colon during laparotomy. Doppler USG detected low flow in the vessels supplying these necrotic segments. However, resection was decided due to necrosis of these segments. These necrotic intestinal segments were resected and an end-ileostomy was performed.

The dental history was composed of very minor dental procedures depending on the growth of the child. No allergies reported. The weight of the patient was 32 kg. The height of the patient was 112 cm.\nThe clinical examination revealed the presence of a high frenum attachment pathologically extending to the palatal inter-incisal region. As a consequence this presented a pathological eruption of the upper central incisors laterally, and towards to the canines.\nIt was decided to perform laser frenectomy without infiltrated anaesthesia using specific laser parameters (). The laser equipment was defined by the manufacturer (Lamda Scientifica Srl) as a class-II B device according to the CE conformity statement, and the parameters were 1400 mW at 808 nm with continuous output. The optical fiber used was 300 μm diameter allowing a very fine soft tissue cut. According to the manufacturer, the optical protective glasses had an Optical Density > 5 at the wavelength of emission from the diode. According to standard EN 60825 CEI 76-2 II, the minimum optical density has been estimated to be 4.96 at 0.05 m.\nThe labial frenum was sprayed with lidocaine twice. The laser fiber was applied vertically and laterally to the frenum initially causing disruption of the mucosa continuity. This easily allowed performing a deeper cut of the frenum in a horizontal dimension. The design of the frenectomy was rhomboidal allowing easy pass of the fiber-optic between the central incisors and from the buccal to palatal area. The whole procedure was performed in about five minutes, without pain. No sutures were required. Haemostasis was optimum immediately after the procedure (). The patient was comfortable with no pain, either intra-operatively or post-operatively. The patient described the procedure as totally painless.

He also complained of myalgia and abdominal pain for the same duration. He reported diffuse abdominal pain, which was 6/10 in severity, nonradiating, and not related to food. He also reported 2 episodes of diarrhea without any blood or mucous, brown in color. He denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, weight loss, history of trauma, extreme exercise, or any history of travel.\nHis abdominal examination was significant for abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants, but was soft and nondistended and bowel sounds were present. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. Triage vitals were significant for a temperature of 103.3°F, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 109/49, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air.\nAdmission laboratory workup revealed leukocyte count of 6.1 × 103 µL (reference range 4.5–11.0 × 103) with 72% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 16.2 g/dL (reference range 13.0–17.0), hematocrit of 48.2% (reference range 39–53), platelet count of 149 × 103 µL (reference range 130–400 × 103), ESR of 4 mm/hr (reference range 0–20), BUN of 34 mg/dL (reference range 8–20), creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (reference range 0.4–1.3), potassium of 4.7 mmol/L (reference range 3.6–5.1), phosphorous of 3.0 mg/dL (reference range 2.4–4.7), aspartate aminotransferase of 1,146 IU/L (reference range 15–41), alanine aminotransferase of 243 IU/L (reference range 17–63), and creatinine kinase of 39,125 IU/L (reference range 38–398). Urinalysis was significant for large blood, and urine red blood cells were 0–2.\nIn view of the high-grade fever, we attempted to find an infectious source to explain his history and presentation. Chest X-ray () and CT scan were obtained and showed no signs of pneumonia. Urinalysis and influenza rapid antigen test were performed and did not reveal any abnormalities. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and did not reveal any focal sources. Stool culture with ova and parasites, blood cultures, urinary toxicology including synthetic THC (K2), HIV, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis panel, Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody, urine Legionella antigen, QuantiFERON® test for tuberculosis, and TSH were all performed as well. All the test results were negative except immunoglobulin M antibodies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae that were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibodies were initially 781 U/mL, which is considered a low positive (reference range 770–950).\nOur patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible gastroenteritis initially while culture and laboratory results were pending. He was managed for his acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis with aggressive parenteral hydration. However, he continued to spike fevers during days 1–4 of the admission, but his diarrhea, abdominal pain, and myalgia resolved by day 3. One week later, mycoplasma antibody was recorded again and it was 976 U/ml, which is considered a true positive (reference range 950+).

    "Upper Limit": "3",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 103.3 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 71.3 = 39.611 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 88.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 6100.0 count/µL. To convert 6100.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 6100.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 6100000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.

    "problem": "<Context> A 35-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome was admitted at 37 weeks gestational age (GA). She was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at 16 years of age. A previous pregnancy at 33 years of age culminated in a missed abortion at 6 weeks GA, for which a dilatation and curettage was performed at our hospital under monitored anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. She underwent a Bentall operation due to aortic regurgitation at 20 years of age. She underwent a vitrectomy at 27 years of age for subluxation of the right lens. She had orthostatic headaches 3 years ago, and dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, which was identified on lumborsacral spine magnetic resonance myelography, was thought to be the cause of the symptoms. At the time of admission, she had a 35-mm abdominal aortic aneurysm for 8 years. The cardiac functions were stable because the previous aortic surgical procedures were well-maintained during the current pregnancy. She was medicated with verapamil, atenolol, and warfarin, which were switched to labetalol and enoxaparin during the pregnancy.\nShe had the pathognomic body habitus of Marfan syndrome (height, 179 cm; weight, 76.2 kg; and arachnodactyly). A metallic click and systolic murmur were auscultated with a stethoscope. Her initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 80/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. A pre-operative echocardiography revealed a normal left ventricle ejection fraction (55-60%) and a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve. Mild ectatic changes in the proximal descending thoracic aorta and distal abdominal aorta (32 × 36 and 34 × 31 mm, respectively) were confirmed with no interval changes compared to the last study checked 1 year ago.\nAn elective cesarean section was recommended by the obstetricians, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists involved in the patient's care. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia is the standard anesthetic choice for cesarean section at our hospital. However, the presence of dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, and a neurosurgeon's warning against spinal anesthesia for the possible recurrence of headache associated with CSF leakage, led us to decide on epidural anesthesia. Enoxaparin was discontinued one day before the scheduled cesarean section and unfractionated conventional heparin was administered until 6 hours before the operation.\nWith the patient in the right lateral position, a 17-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted at the L3-4 interspace under sterile conditions using a midline approach with the loss-ofair resistance technique. Then, a 19-gauge epidural catheter (FlexTip Plus®; Arrow, USA) was inserted via the Tuohy needle and fixed at 9 cm. Eight ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (50 µg) were injected via an epidural catheter as a divided first dose, and the total 27 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (100 µg) was injected incrementally over 10 minutes. Twenty minutes after the last epidural injection of lidocaine, the sensory block was sufficiently high (T4) for the cesarean section. The systolic blood pressure was decreased by 25% and 3 doses of phenylephrine (100 µg) and 1 dose of ephedrine (10 mg) were administered to maintain the blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. She was sedated with propofol after the infant was delivered and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. The baby had been diagnosed prenatally with possible Marfan syndrome and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient's post-operative vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, a heart rate of 83/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Heparin was re-infused 6 hours after the cesarean section. The post-operative pain was managed with patient-controlled epidural analgesia for 3 days post-operatively. The epidural catheter was removed 6 hours after stopping the continuous heparin injection on the 3rd post-operative day. She was transferred to the Cardiology Department for postpartum management and discharged without cardiovascular complications. </Context> <Question> What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 116.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 116.0 mEq. To convert from 116.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 116.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 116.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 116.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 116.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 116.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 33.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 75.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 116.0 + (33.0 / 2.8) + (33.0 / 18) = 247.952 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 247.952 mmol/L.

He was transported and admitted to our hospital after 26 min of symptom onset. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea syndrome, and obesity as his medical history. He had no allergies and had no familial history of coronary artery disease. His Glasgow coma scale was 15 (E4V5M6), and his other vital signs on admission were as follows: blood pressure: 160/113 mmHg; heart rate: 74 beats/min; body temperature: 36.1°C (96.98°F); and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2): 98% on room air. He was 173 cm tall and weighed 105 kg (body mass index was 35.1). A chest examination revealed normal heart and breath sounds. No leg edema was observed. Additional physical examinations revealed no abnormalities. Immediately after admission, electrocardiography (ECG) findings revealed normal sinus rhythm with narrow QRS duration, ST-segment elevation in lead aVR, and ST-segment depression in leads I, II, III, aVL, aVF, and V4-6 (Fig. ). Echocardiography also revealed broad anterolateral akinesis without aortic regurgitation, pericardial effusion, or definite aortic flap. The diameter of the aortic root was 45 mm (Fig. ). As his chest pain had frequent improvements and exacerbations in a short period, we suspected not only the presence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) of the culprit lesion with LMT, but also Stanford type-A AAD involving LMT compression. As plain computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated no definitive signs of AAD with 42 mm in the shortest transverse diameter of the aortic root (Fig. ), he underwent emergency coronary angiography (CAG) soon after the plain CT scan. Because there was no information about his renal function at the time pending the outcome of the blood test on admission and we were concerned about the possibility of the presence of ACS of the culprit lesion with LMT, he did not undergo contrast-enhanced CT scan before CAG. Following some difficulties in manipulating the catheters, CAG revealed 75% stenosis of the LMT ostium (Fig. A). Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS) revealed compression of the LMT ostium from the outside of the true lumen (Fig. ). The vessel size of the LMT ostium was 4.9 mm × 4.7 mm by IVUS, and the lumen size of the LMT ostium was changed from 3.9 mm × 3.5 mm to 1.6 mm × 3.4 mm by IVUS according to LMT compression from the outside of the true lumen. As the patient was in shock state with respiratory failure requiring inotropic agents and intubation at the catheterization laboratory, a bare-metal stent (3.5 mm × 9 mm) was implanted into the LMT ostium, 2–3 mm in the aorta, as a bridge to surgery with low pressure (nine atmosphere) so that a surgeon could pull out the stent during surgery (Fig. B). Antiplatelet agents were not administered in order to help minimize perioperative bleeding complications. A total 5000-U amount of heparin was given during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). His hemodynamics were stabilized, and echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function after PCI. Left ventriculography revealed compression of the true lumen of the ascending aorta from the false lumen of the ascending aorta during heart beats (Fig. C). Then, after PCI, he underwent contrast-enhanced CT imaging, which indicated Stanford type-A AAD (Fig. ). He was safely transferred to another hospital to undergo surgery after three hours of stenting. He underwent hemiarch replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (saphenous vein graft [SVG] to left anterior descending artery, and SVG to left circumflex artery).

The remaining laboratory studies were unremarkable and within normal physiologic limits, including his potassium, calcium and troponin. Surprisingly, the patient’s EKG demonstrated a type 1 Brugada pattern (Figure 1). This was a new finding, as his previous EKG had shown an incomplete right bundle branch block (Figure 2). Cardiology was consulted and it was recommended an echocardiogram and a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest be obtained in order to rule out a right ventricular infarct and pulmonary embolism, respectively. Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 70% with trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. There was no evidence of valvular pathology, hypokinesis, or thrombus. CT angiogram of the chest demonstrated a large opacity in the left lower lobe, and infiltrates in the right upper, middle and lower lobes consistent with pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 1.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 28-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of reduced livido and increased fatigability. He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.\nAt the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6°C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead (). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 μU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 μg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH2O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH2O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.\nHis clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH2O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH2O) (). Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted (). Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 μg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 μg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.\nMRI revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and the high intensity of the posterior lobe was lost, compatible with the diagnosis of CDI (). Considering the patient's age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells (). Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.\nWhile waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred (). After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI (). He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).\nMRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion. However, his pituitary function remained unchanged, and he is currently being treated with prednisolone, levothyroxine natrium, HCG, and dDAVP. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> In February, 2018, a 58-year-old Japanese male was diagnosed with malignant melanoma (pT4b, N3, M0, stage IIIC) in the right toe in our dermatology. Tumor resection was performed. He did not have any medical history relevant to this disease and adverse effects. However, since multiple lung and liver metastases were found during the Feron maintenance therapy after the operation, this subject was treated with nivolumab in July 2018 (week 0) (). The PD-L1 level at the time of treatment was less than 1%, and BRAF was negative in this case. About 4 weeks later, thyrotoxicosis was induced [free T4 (FT4) = 3.67 ng/dl, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) < 0.01 μU/ml], and about 10 weeks later, hypothyroidism was observed (FT4 = 0.55 ng/dl, TSH = 22.10 μU/ml) (). Therefore, we diagnosed him with nivolumab-induced destructive thyroiditis and started replacement therapy with 50 μg/day of levothyroxine, increasing up to 100 μg/day ().\nIn November 2018, nivolumab monotherapy was changed to a combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab in order to enhance the antitumor effect of such medication (). About 4 weeks later, he had fever and a headache. In the cerebrospinal fluid test, a mononucleosis-dominated cell number increase was observed. Thereby, he was diagnosed with aseptic meningitis induced by the combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab (). We stopped both drugs and started steroid therapy with 30 mg of prednisolone. We gradually decreased the dose of prednisolone and stopped it in April 2019. Thereafter, we started nivolumab once more because the metastatic tumors were not altered. At that time, we started nivolumab together with prednisolone, just in case, in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence of the adverse effects triggered by nivolumab (). After stopping prednisolone, however, he felt general fatigue, appetite loss, and nausea, and he had fluid replacement therapy in an outpatient department. Also, the percentage of eosinophils gradually increased up to 10.5% ().\nAbout 9 months after starting nivolumab, he was hospitalized due to pneumonia. After admission, adrenal insufficiency and hypoglycemia were observed [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) < 1.5 pg/ml, cortisol = 3.3 μg/dl, postprandial plasma glucose = 64 mg/dl]. Eosinophil was increased to 9.3% [white blood cell (WBC) = 5,390/μl]. In addition, in the rapid ACTH load test, there was no cortisol response. After the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we started replacement therapy with 15 mg of hydrocortisone. After recovery from pneumonia, he was discharged. Since the metastatic tumors in this subject were substantially reduced by the above-mentioned immune checkpoint inhibitors, it seemed that the pathological course of malignant melanoma was relatively favorable, except for the appearance of several adverse effects with the use of such inhibitors.\nThereafter, he was hospitalized again for further examination of adrenal deficiency. On admission, he continued to take 15 mg (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening) of hydrocortisone and 100 μg of levothyroxine. His height, body weight, and BMI were 168.3 cm, 86.8 kg, and 30.6 kg/m2, respectively. The blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature were 166/99 mmHg, 88bpm, and 36.9°C, respectively. The clinical parameters on admission under replacement therapy with hydrocortisone were as follows: eosinophil, 4.5% (WBC = 7,930/ml); plasma glucose, 95 mg/dl; and HbA1c, 5.5%. Slight hypokalemia was observed (3.3 mmol/L), but renal and liver functions were normal and the lipid parameters were within the normal range. Endocrine system tests at rest revealed low levels of ACTH (<1.5 pg/ml), cortisol (0.3 μg/dl), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S; 6 μg/dl); high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH; 9.77 mIU/ml) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; 26.8 mIU/ml); and normal levels of TSH (4.54 μIU/ml), growth hormone (GH; 0.04 ng/ml), and prolactin (12.1 ng/ml). There was no abnormality in the chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. In sonography, the thyroid size was at the lower limit of normal, and the echo levels were low. In brain computer tomography at the onset of aseptic meningitis, there were no intracranial hemorrhage, space-occupying lesions, or other abnormalities. In contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there were no signs of pituitary swelling, stalk thickness, or space-occupying lesions.\nAll load tests were performed in the morning in a fasting state. As shown in , in the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test, there was no reaction in both the ACTH and cortisol levels, which was compatible with ACTH deficiency. In the GH-releasing peptide 2 (GHRP2) load test, GH showed a normal response, but ACTH did not respond at all, which was also compatible with ACTH deficiency. In addition, as shown in , in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) load test, excess reaction of TSH and normal reaction of prolactin were observed. No increase in FT3 secretion was observed in response to TRH. In the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) load test, the levels of LH and FSH were normally increased. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this subject with isolated ACTH deficiency and destructive thyroiditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors taken for malignant melanoma. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 16-year-old male was referred to our institute Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital for evaluation of rapid weight gain and stunted growth velocity over 4 years. On admission, the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 108 and 72 mmHg, respectively. Body weight and height were 61.1 kg (-0.18 SDS) and 138.5 cm (-5.44 SDS), respectively. The BMI was 31.1 kg/m2 (+2.16 SDS). He displayed a moon-shaped face, buffalo hump, truncal obesity, acanthosis nigricans, and abdominal striae. The volume of each testis was 1 mL, while the Tanner stage of pubic hair was 2.\nThe serum cholesterol level was 173 mg/dL, and serum sodium and potassium levels were 144 mmol/L and 4.5 mmol/L, respectively. The serum insulin and glucose levels were 24.7 µU/mL and 74 mg/dL, respectively. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.8%. The serum cortisol levels in the morning and evening were 23.1 µg/dL and 26.2 µg/dL, respectively, suggesting loss of circadian rhythm. The 24-hour urine free cortisol level was elevated to 160 µg/day (<50 µg/day). The serum cortisol level after overnight dexamethasone suppression was 16.1 µg/dL (<5 µg/dL). A low-dose dexamethasone-suppression test was performed according to the standard protocol (oral dexamethasone 20 µg/kg/day for 2 days). The plasma ACTH, serum cortisol and 24-hour urine free cortisol levels were 40.6 pg/mL (<20 pg/mL), 29.4 µg/day (<5 µg/dL), and 73.5 µg/day (<10 µg/day), respectively, indicating a definitive diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Subsequently, a high-dose dexamethasone test with an oral dexamethasone dose of 80 µg/kg/day demonstrated suppressed plasma ACTH (16.6 pg/mL) and serum cortisol (2.0 µg/dL) levels, indicating that the Cushing disease had been caused by pituitary ACTH secretion.\nThe patient's bone age, as determined by the Greulich-Pyle method), was 11 years. A simple x-ray of the thoracolumbar spine showed osteopenia (), and bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of the lumbar spine and femur neck were -6.127 and -4.518, respectively, as determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Co., Madison, WI, USA). Sellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any evidence of pituitary tumor. As this result suggested a pituitary source of ACTH secretion, BIPSS was performed to determine the laterality of the ACTH secretion. The peak ACTH level measured from the right inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) after injection of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was remarkably higher than that measured from the left IPS, suggesting right lateralization of ACTH secretion ().\nSubsequently, a right hemihypophysectomy was performed by the endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Examination of the biopsied tissue suggested pituitary microadenoma. However, the 24-hour urine free cortisol was persistently elevated to 85.8 µg/day. Repeated BIPSS, moreover, did not show lateralization of ACTH secretion. The peak ACTH levels, though, were markedly increased after CRH loading from both the left and the right petrosal sinus (). Fourteen days after the right hemihypophysectomy, a total hypophysectomy was performed by the transsphenoidal approach. The histological findings were suggestive of nonneoplastic pituitary tissue. Postoperatively, the 24-hour urine free cortisol was 22.5 µg/day, and the plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were 6.9 pg/mL and 1.2 µg/dL, respectively. Owing to symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone were given at a stress dose of 100 mg/m2/day intravenously after surgery and subsequently tapered to the physiologic oral dose of 15 mg/m2/day.\nAn L-dopa test and combined anterior pituitary function test after 2 weeks of the total hypophysectomy revealed growth hormone (GH) deficiency, central hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and ACTH deficiency (). Levothyroxine sodium was added at a dose of 100 µg/day.\nTwo days after total hypophysectomy, desmopressin was started because he showed polyuria, hypernatremia (serum Na, 157 mmol/L), and high serum osmolality (330 mosm/kg) without concentrated urine (urine osmolarity, 96 mosm/kg).\nWithin a month of the total hypophysectomy, recombinant human GH therapy was initiated at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day for 6 days a week subcutaneously. Two months after the total hypophysectomy, intravenous pamidronate was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day over 4 hours for three days every 4 months for three years. Testosterone enanthate was initiated at a dose of 250 mg monthly at age 19 years.\nThe growth rate of the patient increased to 6 cm over the initial one-year follow-up. At age 21, recombinant human GH therapy was discontinued (). After another six months, the peak growth hormone level, as determined by insulin tolerance test, was 0.1 ng/mL, indicating adult GH deficiency. GH therapy subsequently was restarted at a dose of 0.4 mg/day. At his current age of 26, the patient's final height has attained the target range (172.2 cm, -0.20 SDS); weight (58.7 kg, -0.85 SDS). His BMD of femur neck and lumbar spine were 0.679 g/cm2 (z-score= -4.3 ) and 0.555 g/cm2 (z-score= -3.0), respectively.\nAt age 26 years, the patient's testis volume was 1 mL and sexual maturity rating of pubic hair is Tanner stage 4. He has been under treatment with testosterone enanthate, desmopressin acetate, prednisolone, levothyroxine sodium, and recombinant human GH for combined pituitary hormone deficiency and adult GH deficiency. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 157.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 157.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 157.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 157.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 157.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 157.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 74.0 mg/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 157.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (74.0 - 100) = 156.376 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 156.376 mEq/L.",

There were no positive signs in the abdomen or a positive Murphy sign. He had no history of hypertension.\nNo abnormal hormone levels were detected during endocrinological examinations, and routine blood tests were within normal limits (plasma renin 7.70 pg/ml, plasma aldosterone 16.4 ng/dl, plasma adrenaline 32 pg/ml, plasma noradrenaline 730 pg/ml).\nPreoperative computed tomography angiography + computed tomography urography (CTA + CTU) showed a mass with a heterogeneous shadow (9.5 × 6.3 cm) in the right adrenal gland (Fig. ). The mass was well-circumscribed, early peripheral enhancement was obvious in the arterial phase (Fig. ), with central progressive partial filling in the venous phase and in delayed imaging (Figs. , ).\nThe patient was diagnosed with an adrenal tumor preoperatively and pheochromocytoma was considered. However, he was subsequently diagnosed with an adrenal cavernous hemangioma.\nRetroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed following the oral administration of Phenoxybenzanine Hydrochloride 10 mg twice a day for one week. Blood volume was fully expanded by fluid infusion two days before surgery to reduce intraoperative blood pressure fluctuations. It took 145 min to complete the operation. Fluctuating or sometimes substantially elevated catecholamine levels in the blood of pheochromocytoma patients can trigger severe cardiovascular complications such as TTS, heart failure, cerebral haemorrhage and sudden cardiac arrest [] and secondary shock []; thus, perioperative monitoring is critical. In this case, the surgeon strictly followed the principle of “minimal touch” during the operation, and intraoperative anaesthetic monitoring showed that the tumour remained stable during intraoperative contact and tumour haemodynamics. Therefore, the patient was not transferred to the ICU for advanced monitoring, but to a general ward with continuous post-operative monitoring of vital signs for 24 h. After determining that their vital signs were stable, the patient was monitored regularly and discharged 6 days after surgery. The patient was discharged 6 d after surgery.\nHistopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen showed an adrenal hemangioma with extensive internal hemorrhage and necrosis (Fig. ).\nCT was repeated regularly after surgery.

Three days later, catheterization was done and coronary angiography demonstrated left anterior descending artery (LAD) with critical lesion and left circumflex (LCX) atherosclerotic lesion. Angioplasty was performed and two drug-eluting stents (BIOMATRIX 3.0 × 18 and 2.5 × 18) were deployed on LAD and LCX, respectively, with clopidogrel loading 300 mg ().

The patient was found to be somnolent, with elevated blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg and a second generalized seizure. Aspiration during the seizure required intubation and mechanical ventilation until the third day after admission.\nRegarding his past medical history, the patient was first treated for a rapid progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in another hospital when Goodpasture's disease was diagnosed histologically through renal biopsy (linear deposition of immunoglobulins along the basement membrane) and detection of anti-GBM antibodies in the plasma. A cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was administered, but renal disease progressed and hemodialysis became necessary and the cyclophosphamide therapy was terminated. One month later, renal replacement therapy was switched to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Four months later, the patient was readmitted because of a pulmonary complication with anemia due to tracheal suffusions and microbleeds in combination with a gastrointestinal reflux disease. Cyclophosphamide therapy was reintroduced with monthly administration of 1 g as a bolus, initially. Immunosuppressive treatment yielded good elimination of anti-GBM antibodies. However, a consequent immunosuppressive therapy of at least 6 months duration had never been maintained. In summary, the patient received three therapy cycles before admission to our hospital with the central nervous system symptoms, but neither cyclophosphamide nor steroids had been given on a regular basis.\nRoutine laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatinine (1107 μmol/l, normal value: 72-127 μmol/l) and serum urea (16.4 mmol/l, normal value: 3.0-9.2 mmol/l), while blood cell count, electrolytes, blood gas analysis and liver enzymes were normal. A chest X-ray was consistent with pneumonia after aspiration. Cranial computed tomography was normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple T2- and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-hyperintense lesions subcortically, predominantly located in the posterior dorsal and lateral white matter as well as in the cerebellar white matter, consistent with cerebral edema (Figures and ). The lesions did not enhance contrast media nor did they match a pattern of ischemic infarctions. The time-of-flight angiography did not detect vasculitic stenosis.\nAfter extubation, the patient presented a mild psycho-syndrome with cognitive slowing and deficits in mnestic function. Apart from a positive Babinski sign on the left, his neurological state was normal. Due to the initial presentation with pneumonia, high-dose steroid therapy was not administered. Since anti-GBM antibodies were elevated (200 U/mL, normal value: <10 U/mL), plasmapheresis was started, alternating with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. During this therapy, the psycho-syndrome resolved and the MR-morphological alterations almost diminished in parallel (Figure ). Anti-GBM antibodies scaled down to 21 U/mL after five cycles of plasmapheresis initiated at day 6 (substitution of 4 litre albumin at each session) and one pulse of 1 g cyclophosphamide at day 13 (Figure ). Antinuclear antibodies were negative at all times.

To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.113 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.113 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.113 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 113.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 113.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 11.3 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 1107.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 11.3 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (11.3/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**21 * 1.0 = 5.984. Hence, the GFR value is 5.984 ml/min/1.73 m².",

The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mEq. To convert from 133.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 19.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 130.0 mg/dL.

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old male with a history of two transient ischemic attacks was brought into our facility for altered mental status after being found unconscious by a relative. His social history was significant for 55 pack-years of smoking. Due to his mentation on arrival, no further history was obtained. Vital signs were normal on admission. Physical examination on admission showed non-responsiveness to sternal rub, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and thick white plaques around the corners of his mouth. Examination of the extremities showed 1+ bilateral lower leg edema, and pulmonary examination revealed right-sided wheezes and rales.\nOn admission, the patient had an elevated blood glucose of 662 mg/dL (normal: 70-110 mg/dL), an anion gap of 15, ß-hydroxybutyrate of 1.86 mmol/L (normal: 0.02-0.27 mmol/L), point-of-care (POC) lactate of 3.3 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L), serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, urine volume of 850 mL, and no ketones on urinalysis. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, and PCO2 of 33 meq/L. The slightly elevated anion gap on admission is likely multifactorial. It could have been caused by the increase in the negative charge for albumin and enhanced production of lactate seen in metabolic alkalosis []. Conversely, it is also possible that scant ketones, which are produced in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as seen by mildly elevated β-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of ketones in the urine, could have contributed to the elevated anion gap [].\nAdditionally, the patient had hypernatremia (sodium of 185 mEq/L corrected for hyperglycemia), acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] of 49 mg/dL, creatinine [Cr] of 1.55 mg/dL, from a previous baseline Cr of 1.01 mg/dL), and hemoconcentration (hemoglobin [Hb] 17.1 g/dL, hematocrit [Hct] 51.6%). Chest X-ray indicated a potential right lower lung zone infiltrate. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest indicated right lower lobe mass or consolidation, with multiple mediastinal and hilar masses as well as enlarged left axillary nodes compatible with lymphadenopathy, suggestive of malignancy and metastatic disease (Figures , ). CT of the abdomen showed heterogeneous liver attenuation but could not differentiate between nonocclusive disease and metastatic disease. Adrenal nodules and kidney nodular densities were also present (Figure ). CT of the brain showed a suprasellar mass measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm (Figure ). The patient was started on half normal saline and insulin, and the acute kidney injury significantly improved on day 3; however, no significant improvement in sodium level was noticed after correction for elevated glucose levels (Figure and Table ).\nAdditional investigations for the refractory hypernatremia showed a urine osmolarity of 699 (normal: 50-1,400), serum osmolarity of 360 (normal: 280-301), urine sodium of 10 mEq/L (normal: 20 mEq/L), serum AM cortisol of 61.3 ug/dL (normal AM: 6.2-19.4 ug/dL), 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test cortisol of 6.06 ug/dL (normal: <1.8ug/dL) and ACTH of 228 pg/mL (normal: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL) (Table ). MRI of the brain revealed a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm enhancing lesion of the optic chiasm without evidence of mass effect (Figure ) and small lymph nodes in deep portions of the bilateral parotid glands that were potential metastasis. Throughout the admission, the patient’s arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic alkalosis (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, PCO2 of 33 meq/L), which was persistent until discharge (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 27.6 meq/L, PCO2 of 37 mmHg). Additional endocrine investigations demonstrated an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.5-12.4 miU/L), luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.7-8.6 miU/L), testosterone of 27 ng/dL (normal: 264-916 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.01 u/iU/L (normal: 0.34-5.60 u/iU/L), and prolactin of 9.7 ng/mL (normal: 4.0-15.2 ng/mL). The plan was to obtain a lung biopsy to determine whether the mass was cancerous or not and to conduct a high dexamethasone suppression test for ectopic ACTH production. However, the patient declined further workup or treatment, opting for hospice instead.\nDespite initial fluid resuscitation with half normal saline followed by dextrose water, the hypernatremia did not correct. The hypernatremia later resolved after the patient was started on desmopressin on day 7 of admission.

She initiated combination therapy with sildenafil and bosentan, which was switched to macitentan due to hepatotoxicity. Along the clinical course of the disease, the treatment was escalated to subcutaneous treprostinil due to a suboptimal response to dual therapy. Chronic adjuvant therapy included spironolactone and anticoagulation with acenocoumarol.\nHigh-risk categorization was based on clinical variables (WHO functional class 3/4); biochemical markers [Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): 3000 ng/mL, age-related reference value <450 pg/mL]; echocardiographic parameters (right atrium area: 43.2 cm2, right atrial volume: 113 mL/m2, and a moderate pericardial effusion measuring 15 mm); and pulmonary catheterization (right atrial pressure: 17 mmHg). As a result, switching to intravenous infusion of epoprostenol was decided in accordance with local and European guidelines.\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit for placement of a tunnelled central line (Hickman®) and epoprostenol dose titration.\nVital signs recording on admission showed sinus tachycardia at 110 b.p.m., blood pressure 102/70 mmHg, and 97% SpO2 on room air. Cardiovascular physical examination revealed a loud and fixed S2 splitting, palpable parasternal lift at second left intercostal space with dullness on percussion, and mild peripheral oedema.\nFor target dose calculation, we used an approximate equivalent dose ratio of treprostinil to epoprostenol of 2:1 based on the equimolar potency of epoprostenol and the experience of other longer protocols in which the final dose reached this proportion. Thus, the target dose of epoprostenol was estimated at 32 ng/kg/min.\nDrug titration began after central line placement. The infusion rate of each drug was based on its half-life and adjusted every 180 min. Treprostinil dosage decreased 4 ng/kg/min every 3 h while epoprostenol increased 2 ng/kg/min. Epoprostenol was titrated up under close monitoring of respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation. Dosage was reduced to the previous titration step if side effects developed. The transition from SC treprostinil to IV epoprostenol lasted 48 h. There were no adverse events. Pro-BNP level at the end of titration was 2928 pg/mL.\nThe patient was transferred from the cardiac intensive care unit to the cardiology ward 4 days after titration. On the fifth day, she developed a non-pruritic macular rash of the limbs that faded spontaneously within hours without any dosage change and was discharged from hospital 2 days later. There were no significant changes in cardiac ultrasound parameters during hospital stay.\nDespite the well-tolerated infusion of epoprostenol, absence of serious adverse events, and short length of stay, persistence in WHO functional class 3/4 and signs of right-sided heart failure on a 7-day follow-up appointment prompted referral to pre-transplant assessment. At this stage, a new echocardiogram showed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 95 mmHg, impaired right ventricular systolic function, and persistent moderate pericardial effusion.\nOrthotopic double lung transplantation was performed 47 days after discharge, with marked echocardiographic improvement 1 month later (PASP = 31, preserved right ventricular function, and absence of pericardial effusion).\nExamination of the explanted lungs revealed medial wall thickening and muscularization, obliteration of small arteries, intimal fibrosis, and plexiform lesions consistent with IPAH. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

    "Lower Limit": "271.195",
    "Upper Limit": "299.741",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 15.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 362.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 130.0 + (15.0 / 2.8) + (15.0 / 18) = 285.468 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 285.468 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 285.468 mOsm/kg.",

In the past year, he experienced polydipsia and polyuria. Physical examination revealed body weight 17.5 kg (50th percentile), body height 100 cm (15~50th percentile), blood pressure 230/120 mmHg, heart rate 138 /min, and decreased skin turgor. There was no focal neurological deficit, blood pressure discrepancy between upper and lower extremities, palpable mass, nor any appreciation of an abdominal thrill. Laboratory studies revealed serum Na+ 124 mmol/L, K+ 2.4 mmol/L, Cl− 87 mmol/L, Ca2+ 8.5 mg/dL, HCO3− 34.5 mEq/L, creatinine 0.41 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, IgG 247 mg/dL, and osmolality 290 mOsm/KgH2O. Urine analysis was significant for creatinine 11.2 mg/dL, Na+ 24 mEq/L, K+ 18 mEq/L, Cl− 24 mEq/L, osmolality 232 mOsm/KgH2O, RBC 168/μL, FENa 6%, and nephrotic-range proteinuria (55 mg/m2/hour). Survey for possible glomerulonephritis demonstrated the absence of anti-streptolysin O, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, ANA, and normal immunoglobulin A, C3, and C4 levels. In addition, work-up for secondary hypertension included: free T4 1.51 (normal range 0.8–2.0 ng/dL), TSH 5.7 (normal range 0.25–5.00 μIU/mL), cortisol 40.18 (normal range 4.3–25 μg/dL), ACTH 9.32 (normal range < 46 pg/mL), renin 1745 (normal range 2–15 ng/L), aldosterone 92.6 (normal range 4–25 ng/dL), and urine vanillylmandelic acid 3.8 (normal range 1.9–9.9 g/day). Renal ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic right kidney (7.6 cm in length) and small left kidney (5.3 cm in length). Due to the presence of hyperreninemic hypertension, natriuretic-hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and nephrotic range proteinuria, HHS was highly suspected. Computed tomography angiography confirmed high-grade renal artery stenosis with hypoplasia of the left kidney (Fig. ).\nIn terms of management for this case, we began with volume repletion by normal saline administration. Subsequently, his blood pressure declined from 210/120 mmHg to 180/90 mmHg. Intravenous calcium channel blocker was used to treat his hypertensive emergency, while oral captopril was prescribed for RAA axis blockage after diagnosis of unilateral renal artery stenosis. The systolic blood pressure gradually declined to 150~160 mmHg on the 3rd day. Potassium supplement was infused for his profound hypokalemia and generalized muscle weakness. Due to the severity of left renal artery stenosis, he was not a candidate for angiographic intervention, and decision was made to proceed with left nephrectomy. Overall, electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia were corrected within 1 week after admission, and resolution of polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, and hypertension were achieved 2 weeks after nephrectomy (Additional file : Table S1). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "problem": "<Context> A 63-year-old female patient with a history of total hysterectomy for the treatment of uterine rupture 30 years previously presented with a fever of 38°C that had lasted for 3 days and swelling of the right cheek and lower jaw. Antimicrobial treatment prescribed by a general practitioner did not relieve the swelling. She was unable to eat solid food because of odynophagia and trismus and had repeated episodes of vomiting and diarrhea due to excessive water intake during hot days with the highest temperature of ≥35°C. Physical examination at presentation revealed swelling and warmth in the submandibular and buccal regions and mild airway narrowing. She complained of numbness of the extremities and cramps in the calves, hyperpnea, and restlessness. Blood pressure was 115/84 mmHg, pulse 72 bpm, arterial oxygen saturation 99%, and blood glucose 98 mg/dL. Since serum biochemistry and hematology examinations revealed abnormal electrolyte values, inflammatory response, and anemia, she was hospitalized for drainage and fluid therapy. Under local anesthesia, an incision was made in the gingiva on the buccal side of the mandibular premolars, and a gauze drain was inserted in the incision. Since spasm and numbness of the extremities continued, she was treated with diazepam 2.5 mg. Fluid therapy was initiated with 5% glucose solution 250 mL and a hypotonic electrolyte solution 1,000 mL/day. Laboratory findings on day 1 of hospitalization were Na 117 mEq/L, K 3.5 mEq/L, and Cl 83 mEq/L. Since abnormal electrolyte levels, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea continued, she received metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously and also received infusions of a hypotonic electrolyte solution 1,500 mL/day and physiological saline 700 mL/day to correct serum sodium levels. On day 2 of hospitalization, numbness of the extremities disappeared and nausea and vomiting improved, but watery stools continued. Although the distance she was able to open the mouth improved to about two-finger width and she became able to eat meals, she still complained of anorexia. Fluid therapy was continued with a hypotonic electrolyte solution 1,000 mL, maltose-lactated Ringer's solution 500 mL/day, and physiological saline 1200 mL. In the evening of day 3, electrolyte levels returned to normal ranges although inflammatory reaction was still observed. Fluid therapy was switched to physiological saline 100 mL on day 4. Since severe vomiting and diarrhea recurred at night on day 4 of hospitalization, she received metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously, and electrolyte infusion of a hypotonic electrolyte solution 1,000 mL, maltose-lactated Ringer's solution 500 mL, and physiological saline 200 mL was restarted. On day 6, as swelling in the buccal and mandibular regions subsided, the gauze drain was removed. However, generalized malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and numbness of the extremities recurred, and serious hyponatremia with Na 111 mEq/L, K 3.7 mEq/L, and Cl 79 mEq/L developed. She was treated with water restriction and infusion of maltose-lactated Ringer's solution 500 mL/day, a hypotonic solution 500 mL/day, and physiological saline 600 mL/day.

The adult donor was his sister sharing 1-haplotype; the AHG-CDC cross match was negative, the PRA result was 1% and 0% for class I and class II, respectively. Time zero graft biopsy was not performed due to a limited subcapsular hematoma in the superior pole. He received basiliximab induction, followed by methylprednisolone, tacrolimus (TAC), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given for bacterial prophylaxis. He was determined to have a low-risk CMV (D−/R−) status so no viral prophylaxis was administered in this regard. On day 5-posttransplantation (post-KT), a Doppler US was performed in which adequate renal perfusion and normal graft characteristics were observed. He was discharged on day 6 post-KT with a serum creatinine (SCr) of 1.2 mg/dL and an immunosuppressive regimen based on TAC, MMF, and prednisone administered at a dose of 6 mg/BID (trough levels 8 ng/dL), 500 mg/BID, and 10 mg/day, respectively.\nAfter an uneventful posttransplant evolution, the patient was hospitalized 9 days later due to gross haematuria, dysuria, and an elevation of SCr to 1.5 mg/dL. A complete workup was performed. CBC showed Hb 11 g/dL, leukocytes 5.8 K/uL, and platelets 238 K/uL. Urine analysis showed 49 leukocytes and 135 erythrocytes per each high-power field. Ceftriaxone 2 g IV BID was administered for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) along with IV fluids. His vital signs were as the following: temperature 36.7°C, blood pressure 130/65 mm/Hg, pulse rate 100 bpm, and respiratory frequency 20/min.\nOn day 1 of hospitalization, the patient developed fever of 39°C which was treated with paracetamol. Leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia became evident with Hb 7.5 mg/dL, leukocyte 2.0 K/uL, and platelets 124 K/uL. There was also an increase in SCr to 2.04 mg/dL. A Doppler US was performed in which an image compatible with a renal graft residual hematoma, evidence of moderate hydronephrosis and blood clots in the bladder, were observed. Computed tomography (CT) scan studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis exclusively showed a residual fluid collection surrounding the graft. Urine and blood cultures were negative for bacteria. A graft biopsy was performed which showed normal histology on light microscopy; routine panel of immunofluorescence was negative. Immunohistochemistry for adenovirus (cell marque 1 : 100), CMV (cell marque 1 : 50), SV-40 (cell marque 1 : 100), and LMP1 (cell marque 1 : 100) did not demonstrate the presence of viral particles (Figures and ). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigenemia and parvovirus B19 antigenemia were negative. BK virus was also negative in blood and urine analysis. On day 3, blood and urine real-time qualitative polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus yielded positive results.\nOn day 4 of hospitalization, a cystoscopy was performed due to persistent haematuria. There was evidence of clots but no active bleeding, although abnormal mucosal inflammation and petechia were evident. MMF was withdrawn, and the dose of TAC was reduced to reach a blood level of 5 ng/dL (previous blood level 15.3 ng/mL). The patient continued to be febrile with a temperature of 39°C, for which ceftriaxone was substituted by 1 g IV ertapenem QD. Twenty-four hours later, ertapenem was replaced by meropenem. A continuous cystoclysis was placed through the Foley catheter to relieve the haematuria. There was a SCr decrease to 1.53 mg/dL.\nOn day 7 of hospitalization, ribavirin was started at a dose of 800 mg/6 hr. It is worth mentioning that the antiviral drug was not available before this day. Renal function showed further deterioration with an elevation of SCr to 1.95 mg/dL, leukocytes count was 4.2 K/uL, platelets 233 K/uL, and Hb was 7.9 mg/dL. The fever persisted with a temperature of 40°C. On day 9, the SCr decreased to 1.48 mg/dL.\nThe treatment for adenovirus continued with ribavirin 800 mg/6 hr for 10 days until the dosage was reduced to 400 mg/6 hr due to evidence of leukopenia. The treatment continued for a total of 20 days until the urine and blood real-time PCR was negative and the patient was asymptomatic; the urine analysis was normal as well. Fifteen days later, the patient returned with gross haematuria, fever, and a positive blood real-time PCR for adenovirus. He received treatment with IVIG with a total dose of 2 g/kg. He was later discharged with a stable renal function.\nEight months later, his renal function is stable with aSCr of 1.33 mg/dL and is currently on treatment with TAC 10 mg/day (8.5 ng/dL), MMF 500 mg/day, and prednisone 5 mg/day. Viral serology for CMV with pp65 antigenemia and parvovirus B19 antigenemia has remained negative. Blood and urine real-time PCR for adenovirus has remained negative in 3 serial subsequent determinations ().

The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 4200.0 count/µL. To convert 4200.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 4200.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 4200000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3.

A size 11-French (3.7 mm) 20 cm long hemodialysis catheter (Quinton, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) was inserted into the right femoral vein by an ICU “specialist”. No abdominal radiographs were obtained to ascertain the location of the catheter; however, a chest radiograph obtained later that day for follow-up on pulmonary infiltrates was reported to show a possible guide wire in the right side of the chest. The ICU physicians dismissed the radiologist report considering that the patient had not undergone attempts at internal jugular or the subclavian veins cannulations. Meanwhile, the patient underwent two plasmapheresis therapies through the catheter over two consecutive days without any symptoms. Another chest radiograph performed on the second day was reported to show an intact guide wire in the right hemothorax. A review of the radiographs by the ICU team confirmed the presence of an intact guide wire in the chest [].

He had no prior liver insult.\nPhysical examination revealed no specific finding. He did not have palpable lymph nodes on the head, neck, and inguinal area. There was no suspicious skin lesion. Digital rectal examination was negative, and no perirectal mass or lesion was found. Breathing sound was clear without wheezing or crackle.\nInitial vital sign was non-specific (blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 20/min, body temperature 36.3°C). Laboratory work-up showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/Gamma-guanosine triphosphate (r-GTP) level of 345/245 IU/L. But total bilirubin 0.44 mg/dL, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) 22 IU/L and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT) 27 IU/L level were within normal limits. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC 14,800/mm3, segmented neutrophil 79.5%), anemia (Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytosis (Platelet 485 ×103/mm3).

Unlike primary hepatocellular carcinoma, liver mass showed delayed fill-in enhancement pattern, which mimics cholangiocarcinoma, rather than primary hepatocellular carcinoma (). But Tumor thrombi was invading the middle hepatic vein, extending to the right atrium via inferior vena cava, which was unusual finding for mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma ().\nAlso, there were multiple metastatic lymphadenopathy involving porta hepatis, portocaval, retrocaval and paraaortic space, with benign-looking multiple cysts in the both kidneys, 2.2 cm cyst in the uncinate process of pancreas.\nNon-enhanced Chest CT from other hospital showed metastasis to the right ninth rib and surrounding paravertebral soft tissue with osteolytic change (). As mass size was huge and showed the aggressive form, we decided to perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for evaluating disease extent.\nAdditionally, PET-CT scan revealed a small hypermetabolic lymph node in the left supraclavicular area, which was suspected as metastatic lesion (). Excisional biopsy on supraclavicular lymph node returned negative. In turn, we had to perform an ultrasonography guided needle biopsy of the liver for pathologic confirmation. Pathology of the liver mass showed infiltrating feature with squamoid shaped cells with varying degrees of differentiation and atypia, which suggests tumor mass as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (). Immunohistochimistry and special staining for needle biopsy specimens were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, 8, 19, and p63. And anti-hepatocyte was negative, suggesting tumor as primary or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the liver ().\nThe patient underwent an extensive workup to search for a primary squamous carcinoma lesion, including neck CT, chest CT, duodenoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, laryngoscopy and ENT survey, all of which turned out to be negative. Taken together, we concluded the tumor as a primary SCC of the liver.\nDuring the hospital day, patient presented uncontrolled high and recurrent fever, which was suspected to be the cancer fever.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female. The patient's height is 155.0 cm, which is 155.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 61.024 in.  For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.024 (in inches) - 60) = 47.855 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 47.855 kg.The patient's weight is 89.0 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 47.855 kg + 0.4 * (89.0 kg  - 47.855 kg) = 64.313 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 64.313 kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 69-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of anorexia and fever. He had suffered an acute middle cerebral artery territory stroke 45 days previously and underwent treatment. The only medications he was taking were for stroke (aspirin 100 mg, cilostazol 100 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and rabamipide 100 mg). On the initial physical examination, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 162/79 mm Hg; pulse rate, 104 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; and temperature, 37.8°C. He had severe dysarthria and right extremity weakness due to the stroke. No malar rash, oral ulcers, jugular venous distension, or lymphadenopathy were observed. Bilateral fine crackles were detected on chest auscultation, and his abdomen was soft but there was no organomegaly. Multiple pinkish reticulated patches were observed on the lower leg. The results of initial laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 17 630/μL (4000-10 000/μL); hemoglobin, 9.1 g/dL (13.0-17.0 g/dL); blood urea nitrogen, 24.3 mg/dL (6-20 mg/dL); creatinine, 1.52 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL); C-reactive protein, 153.5 mg/dL (0.0-5.0 mg/dL); MPO–ANCA, 100.0 U/mL (0-4.9 U/mL); and PR3–ANCA, negative. The urinalysis revealed the following findings: protein, 2+; blood, 2+; red blood cells, 5-9/high power fields (HPF); and WBC, 5-9/HPF. Serum/urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed nonspecific findings (Table ). Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis was noted on a chest X-ray (CXR). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of a newly developed infarction, but the hemorrhagic transformation of the left MCA infarction lesion was detected (frontoparietal lobes, basal ganglia, and insular region). His baseline serum creatinine was 0.71 mg/dL, which increased to 1.52 and 2.24 mg/dL on days 1 and 3 of admission, respectively. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed on day 7 of admission. Seven fibrocellular crescents out of 17 glomeruli were observed on light microscopy (Figure ). Some were associated with fibrinoid necrosis, and numerous neutrophils were detected in the capillary lumen. In addition, a few small vessels with neutrophil infiltration and fibrin deposition were evident, indicating acute necrotizing vasculitis (Figure ). Most of the interstitial area was infiltrated by numerous plasma cells and several neutrophils. The possibility of crescentic glomerulonephritis, associated with plasma-cell proliferative disease or IgG-related disease, was considered. Kappa and Lambda in situ hybridization revealed a positive staining pattern, indicating polyclonality (Figure ). In addition, IgG4-positive plasma cells were up to 200/HPF in the interstitial area. Unlike IgG4-tubulointerstitial nephritis, there was no sclerosing lymphoplasmacytic inflammation or apparent obliteration of the tubules. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with microscopic polyangiitis having pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis with fibrinoid necrotizing vasculitis. A bone marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy showed a normocellular marrow with no increase in plasma cells (1.8% of all nucleated cells), and no evidence of BM involvement by monoclonal plasma cells. His Birmingham vasculitis activity score was 27. Serum creatinine peaked at 3.1 mg/dL. He received three pulses of methylprednisolone (500 mg/day) followed by prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (1.5 mg/kg/day). After treatment, his serum creatinine improved to 2.3 mg/dL, and the microscopic hematuria disappeared. Furthermore, his fever and skin lesions improved. He was discharged with prednisolone 40 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day), peroral cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day, and his renal function remained stable until 2 months after discharge. No side effects were observed due to the immunosuppressive agents. The dose of azathioprine was maintained, and the dose of prednisolone was tapered to 30 mg/day. He was subsequently lost to follow-up and died 16 months later due to pneumonia. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CURB-65 score? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points. The patient is 69 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. Because the patient does not have confusion, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the score at 1. The concentration of BUN is 24.3 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2. The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 162 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 79 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg.

    "problem": "<Context> We present an 11-year-old female with complex medical history consisting of developmental delay, septo-optic dysplasia, central DI, panhypopituitarism including central adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and epilepsy. Her weight at presentation was 49.5 kg. She presented to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care academic medical center with impending respiratory failure (approximately two months after the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States). She became ill eight days before presenting to the ED with fever. At that time, she was taken to a local urgent care facility where she was diagnosed with an acute otitis media. She was started on PO amoxicillin for an anticipated 10-day course of therapy. She was also given stress-dosed hydrocortisone (30 mg PO, twice daily) given her underlying panhypopituitarism. During the subsequent days, there was no reported change in oral intake or urine output (UOP). Her fevers initially improved; however, they never fully resolved. Three days prior to presentation, the patient experienced increased frequency and temperature of fevers. She again presented to a local urgent care facility where a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (via the PCR test). Within a few days, she developed a persistent, nonproductive cough, increased work of breathing, and shortness of breath, prompting the evaluation in the ED. Initial vital signs were remarkable for rectal temperature of 40.8°C, heart rate of 163 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical exam revealed an alert female in a moderate amount of respiratory distress as evidenced by tachypnea and intermittent grunting. Dry oral mucosa was noted indicating a mild amount of dehydration. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. Laboratory results were remarkable for hyperosmolar hypernatremia (serum sodium of 156 mmol/L and serum osmolality of 321 mOsm), mild hyperglycemia (serum glucose of 146 mg/dL), and elevated ESR (21 mm/hr), CRP (2.3 mg/dL), and procalcitonin (6.9 ng/dL). Her respiratory distress acutely worsened within hours of her ED arrival, and she was intubated for acute hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure (immediate postintubation arterial blood gas with pH 7.20, PCO2 78, PO2 132, HCO3 30, and BD 1.7).\nThe patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). She was transitioned from her home regimen of subcutaneous desmopressin to a 0.5 mU/kg/hr Vasopressin infusion. Review of her baseline condition revealed that her DI was well controlled on her home regimen. She was continued on stress-dosed steroids (methylprednisolone 20 mg q6h IV). The patient had acute lung injury (SaO2/FiO2 = 120). Mechanical ventilator settings were adjusted to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Arterial and central venous lines were placed to promote more accurate determination of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratios) and venous monitoring. She was started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine in addition to receiving one dose of tocilizumab. Ceftriaxone was used to treat presumed bacterial superinfection based on the severity of the patient's clinical status. At the time of the patient's presentation, our institutional protocol for the treatment of severe COVID-19 infection was based on current literature suggesting that the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine may achieve antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects against SARS-CoV-2 []. Additionally, at this time, tocilizumab was suggested to have beneficial effects against “cytokine storming” in SARS-CoV-2 patients []. The patient had hypotension that was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. An epinephrine infusion was started to maintain adequate blood pressures. Given the patient's underlying conditions and critical state, chemistry panels were drawn every six hours on day one of admission. These panels quickly revealed a steady worsening of hypernatremia to a maximum value of 171 mmol/L associated with increasingly abundant UOP of more than 4 L on the first day of hospitalization (Figures and ). These changes occurred despite a maximum Vasopressin infusion rate of 8 mU/kg/hr along with appropriate, simultaneous adjustments in both the sodium concentration and rate of administered IV fluids.\nBy the second day of hospitalization, a net positive fluid balance of 2.8 L was noted and severe hypernatremia persisted (serum sodium of 160 mmol/L). Her moderate ARDS continued (PaO2/FiO2 = 132) []. When the hypernatremia persisted into the third day of hospitalization, a trial of Furosemide (10 mg IV) in addition to decreasing the Vasopressin dose from 8 mU/kg/hr to 6 mU/kg/hr was attempted. After five doses of IV Furosemide over a 48-hour period along with reduction in the Vasopressin dose, successful diuresis along with resolution of hypernatremia was achieved (net balanced fluid balance of -497 mL and reduction in serum sodium to 138 mmol/L, respectively) (Figures and ). Her ARDS gradually improved. The patient was extubated on hospital day 10. She remained hospitalized in the PICU for a total of 29 days during which time she was weaned from supplemental oxygen and was gradually weaned from sedative medications. She had normal serum sodium levels and UOP throughout the remainder of her PICU stay. She was discharged to her home with an outpatient subspecialist follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Gardi Hospital, Surasa, Ujjain, India with complains of decreased appetite since past four to five days, yellowish discoloration of sclera noticed since past two days and deep yellow coloured urine since past two days. Patient had no history of clay coloured stools, fever, vomiting, haematemesis, malena or history suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. The perinatal history was uneventful with no history of umbilical sepsis. The child had no significant past medical history including that of jaundice. Immunization of the child was appropriate for age. At initial examination her anthropometric measurements showed a weight of 15 Kg and a height of 110 cm. The weight-for-age was between 3rd to 15th percentiles; height-for-age between 50th to 85th percentiles and weight-for-height below 3rd percentile, according to the WHO Reference Growth Standards 2007 ( ). The anthropometric findings were suggestive of acute on chronic malnutrition with stunting. The dietary evaluation revealed a diet inadequate in calories (by one third), proteins (by one fourth) and iron (by half) for her age and sex. The vitals at presentation were heart rate of 120 per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute and blood pressure of 98/60 mm of Hg in right in right upper limb in supine position. Four-limb blood pressure measurement was also normal. Icterus was noticed. Examination of ears, nose and throat showed no abnormality. No skin rash was present. No clubbing, cyanosis or oedema of arms or legs was noted. Cardiovascular examination was normal. The lungs were clear on percussion and auscultation. The abdomen was soft with no organomegaly or clinical ascites. A provisional diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis was made based on history, clinical examination and local endemicity of acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis A or hepatitis E. Only blood investigation advised was serum bilirubin, which showed total bilirubin 9.29 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 7.38 mg/dl and indirect bilirubin of 2.41 mg/dl. Patient was treated symptomatically for viral hepatitis and asked to follow up if any danger signs of acute viral hepatitis appear or after 4 weeks. No serological confirmation of viral hepatitis was deemed necessary in view of acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus being an endemic disease in the geographic region.\nPatient followed four weeks later with persistence of yellowish discoloration of sclera but had no other symptoms. Her clinical examination was unremarkable. A liver profile, complete blood counts and abdominal ultrasonography (USG) were ordered. The complete blood counts were within normal limits and did not reveal any evidence of hypersplenism. The liver profile showed total bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 3.23 mg/dl and indirect bilirubin of 0.22 mg/dl; aspartate transaminase (AST) 98.2 IU/L (normal values 15–46 IU/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 109.3 IU/L (normal values 13–69 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase 269.3(normal values 38–126 IU/L); prothombin time (PT) 14 with control of 16; INR 1.2. Abdominal ultrasound showed course ecotexture of the liver with anomalous portal vein. The size of portal vein was 8 mm. The portal vein drained into inferior vena cava. A CT angiography was advised following the above abdominal ultrasound report. The contrast enhanced CT scan of upper abdomen with MIP to include of whole thickness of portal vein revealed that the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein join to form a confluence that drained directly in the inferior vena cava.

    "problem": "<Context> A 51-year-old man who had been diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer four years earlier had undergone treatment with a subtotal colectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. He had received a craniotomy to excise a brain tumor one month previously. His height was 177 cm and his weight was 73 kg. His current chief complaint was a two-month history of severe back pain, accompanied by a tingling sensation, with radiation of the pain into both inguinal regions, especially the right. The patient's knee jerk reflexes were normal without neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the patient's lumbar spine, at L1, L2, L4, and L5. The main cause of the patient's symptoms was a lesion in L1, which had metastasized to the posterior vertebral body wall and right pedicle, resulting in spinal cord compression (). The patient had received radiation therapy before visiting the pain clinic, and he was taking oxycodone 40 mg and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day with no complications. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience significant pain. The pain was aggravated by changes in position from lying to sitting and relieved when he was lying. He rated his pain as 6–10 on the numeric 0–10 rating scale (NRS).The patient's average pain score with respect to the NRS was 8/10. However, he did not wish to undergo open surgery because of his poor general condition and short life expectancy. We initially planned to reduce the patient's pain using an epidural block prior to secondary interventional management, but he was not able to tolerate the prone position required to receive the epidural block due to the severe radiating pain he experienced in that position. Therefore, it was necessary to treat the patient's pain maximally in a single therapeutic session. Thus, we proposed to perform BRFD with PVP and the patient agreed to undergo the procedure.\nWe proceeded under conscious sedation administered by an experienced anesthesiologist, because of the patient's poor general condition and in order to prevent neurological complications during the procedure. For analgesia, a 12 µg fentanyl patch was applied to the patient's right upper thorax twelve hours before the procedure, and an intramuscular injection of pethidine 25 mg was also administered ten minutes before the procedure. One hour before the procedure, the patient received an intramuscular injection of midazolam 3 mg for sedation. During the procedure, the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram were monitored. The patient was placed on an operating table in the prone position with a flexed hip. His skin was prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. The entry point of the needle through the skin was determined using an axial MRI (). The needle was inserted 9 cm lateral to the midline. After a subcutaneous 1% lidocaine injection, a small incision was made with a blade, and under continuous fluoroscopic monitoring, an 18 gauge needle and guidewire were inserted sequentially through the incision site until the tip of the needle reached the middle portion of the L1 pedicle. Then, a dilator was used to insert a 2.7 mm diameter cannula (Disc-FX® System, Elliquence, LLC, Baldwin, NY, USA) to the middle portion of the pedicle in the lateral view and the medial pedicular margin in the anteroposterior (AP) view. A trephine was inserted through the working channel to the posterior body line in the lateral view and the median vertebral line in the AP view. After removing the guidewire and trephine, a 2.5 mm diameter bipolar probe (Trigger-Flex® Bipolar System, Elliquence) was inserted through the working channel (). An energy generator (Surgi-Max®, Elliquence) that emits high radiofrequency and low temperature radiowaves was connected to the Trigger-Flex® Bipolar probe and we shrank the tumor mass by ablation using the turbo-modulation mode. We also used the bipolar hemo-modulation mode for thermocoagulation to prevent bleeding. We conducted five cycles of the procedure while subtracting from the midline of the vertebral body to the lateral border of the right pedicle at the L1 level. The procedure was repeated using the turbo-modulation mode and the hemo-modulation mode in shifts per five second. Once the radiofrequency ablation procedure was completed, we performed PVP at the L1 and L2 bodies. The bone puncture needles were inserted into the posterior 1/3 aspect of the L1 body and the medial part of the L2 body in the lateral view and the median vertebral line in the AP view through the right pedicle. Two ml of sterile polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) powder (Exolent Spine, Elmdown, Ltd., London, UK) and the liquid components were injected to the L1 and L2 bodies under frequent fluoroscopic lateral and AP views to avoid PMMA leakage into the venous system and the epidural space (). We completed the procedure after confirming via fluoroscope that there was no leakage of cement. The patient's radiating pain disappeared after the procedure, and there were no complications. Following the procedure, the patient's vital signs were monitored and he was observed for any neurological complications for 30 min in the outpatient recovery room, after which he was transferred to the general ward.\nThe patient was discharged the day after the procedure because he reported relief of his pain to a level of 1/10 on the NRS without any complications, and he was able to sit without pain. He was then able to undergo continuous chemotherapy and radiotherapy for treatment of the multiple bone metastases. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient's average pain score with respect to the NRS was 1/10.

Preoperative examination showed that the tumor was located in the middle part of the stomach and had invaded the muscularis propria (MP) but without lymph node metastasis. She underwent LADG with extragastric lymph node dissection (D2) [] using laparoscopic ultrasonic shears (Harmonic Scalpel; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Billroth I gastroduodenostomy was performed, and a drain was placed under the left lobe of the liver from the right upper abdomen. On postoperative day 2, the patient was allowed oral intake of food. The drain was removed at postoperative day 3. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged at postoperative day 14. Histological tumor findings were M, Less, Type 2, 50 × 20 mm, por > sig, pT1b (SM2), pN1 (2/47), pStage IB [].\nTwo months after LADG, she was readmitted to hospital because of abdominal distension. Her weight was 55.0 kg, a gain of 0.8 kg since discharge. Physical examination revealed increasing abdominal girth and bilateral leg edema. The serum albumin concentration was 3.0 g/dL, showing hypoalbuminemia. Ultrasound examination confirmed diffuse ascites. A percutaneous peritoneal drainage catheter was placed in the peritoneal cavity under ultrasonographic imaging, and 7100 mL of white-milky fluid was drained which had a high triglyceride level of 1320 mg/dL. Cytological examination of the ascites showed it to be class IIb. Bacterial culture was negative. We therefore made a diagnosis of chylous ascites.\nAlthough a fat-restricted diet was initiated, abdominal girth gradually increased. Oral intake was discontinued and total parenteral nutrition started on the 5th day, but increasing body weight and decreasing serum albumin concentration was not controlled. Because no improvement was observed, PTTDE was performed on the 8th day.\nUltrasound-guided access to the left inguinal lymph nodes was achieved with a 26G needle. Lipiodol was slowly administered to the lymph nodes. Fluoroscopic imaging showed an accumulation of Lipiodol in the left lumbar lymphatic channels (Fig. ) and the thoracic duct. Fluoroscopic imaging indicated the leakage site to be in the upper abdominal thoracic duct (Fig. ).\nPercutaneous transabdominal thoracic duct cannulation was performed using a 21G Chiba needle at the level of the navel under fluoroscopic guidance, and a V-18 peripheral guidewire was used to probe for the duct. Once the thoracic duct had been accessed, a microcatheter (Prominent Raptor) was passed over the guide wire into the upper thoracic duct. Thoracic duct embolization was then performed. First, microcoils (AZUR CX 6 mm–20 cm and 5 mm–15 cm) were positioned to provide a matrix for glue polymerization on the thoracic part of the thoracic duct, after which 20% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) diluted with Lipiodol was used for embolization (Fig. ). Abdominal CT scan obtained immediately after lymphangiography and PTTDE showed contrast pooling between the abdominal aorta and the pancreas head and contrast extravasations accumulating at Morrison’s pouch (Fig. ).\nTwo days after thoracic duct embolization, her body weight showed a progressive decrease and inversely, her serum albumin concentration increased. Five days after thoracic duct embolization, oral intake was resumed and on the 24th day (17 days after thoracic duct embolization), she was discharged without recurrence of ascites (Fig. ). She has remained asymptomatic. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

She had no other symptoms, except for general weakness and central obesity (body mass index 23.4 kg/m2). No tumor-like mass was checked at her head and neck, nothing was discovered in chest auscultation. When we checked her abdomen, neither any pain nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed. No skin or oral mucosa pigmentation was found. There was no edema in lower leg. The neurological examination results were also normal. She weighed 51.5 kg and was 148.2 cm tall, and she was somewhat short woman with a short neck and round face, similar to a clinical features of AHO, but there was no pathognomonic brachydactyly.\nThe result of complete blood count was the hemoglobin 9.3 g/dL, the erythrocyte average volume 96 fL, leukocyte 5,720/mm3, and platelets 310,000/mm. The results of anemia work up were the total iron binding capacity 447.5 µg/dL, serum ferritin 35.11 ng/mL, reticulocyte count 2.89%, average erythrocyte hemoglobin density 32.6 g/dL, and vitamin B12 839.65 pg/mL. Her blood glucose level was 212 mg/dL, the level of hemoglobin A1c was 7.3%, and the simultaneous measurement of serum level of C-peptide showed decreased level of 0.13 ng/mL. Serum concentration of total calcium were 5.5 mg/dL (range, 8.7 to 1.4); ionized Ca 1.56 mg/dL (range, 2.3 to 2.58); phosphorus 6.7 mg/dL (range, 2.5 to 4.5); total protein 6.7 g/dL; albumin 3.3 g/dL; alkaline phosphatase 329 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase 119 IU; alanine aminotransferase 65 IU/L. Intact PTH level was 13.32 pg/mL (range, 13 to 54). Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels were 11.92 pg/mL (range, 10 to 60) and 0.94 (range, 9.4 to 26.1). The results of rapid ACTH stimulation test for adrenal function were normal. The results of thyroid function test were T3 99.01 ng/mL, free T4 0.85 µg/dL, and thyroid stimulating hormone 7.99 µIU/mL. The results for antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibody were positive (52.91 IU/mL, 132.57 IU/mL), and, both islet cell antibody and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody tested negative. In the Ellsworth-Howard examination, urinary phosphoric acid was slightly increased (12.3 mg/dL) and the increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was sufficient (4,400 µmol/mL). There was no GNAS mutation. Serum levels of sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were within normal limits at 144 mmol/L, 5.3 mmol/L, 8.2 mg/dL, and 1.0 mg/dL.\nThe chest X-ray showed no abnormal lesion. An brain computed tomography scan showed prominent calcifications in both basal ganglion and hypothalamus (). The thyroid sonogram discovered several nodules, sized 4.5×3.7 mm and 3.9×2.9 mm on each side that were suspected to be thyroid papillary cancer.\nThe patient came to the hospital experiencing general weakness, and she was diagnosed with hypocalcaemia on laboratory examination. At that time, both the levels of PTH and vitamin D were within normal range, but she had previously experienced spasm symptoms and the levels of previous intact PTH were low (4.38 to 10.66 pg/mL) 7 years ago. She has taken oral calcium medicine for treatment of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism because she had no underlying secondary disorders for hypocalcemia and low PTH level. Although she has no pathognomonic brachydactyly, her appearance was similar to AHO in clinical features including short stature, intelligence decline, round face, calcification on basal ganglion and hypothalamus, or obesity. Furthermore, she had a lower normal PTH level and hypocalemia on admission, and we decided to investigate the PTH resistance to identify PHP Ia or PPHP with AHO. In the Ellsworth-Howard examination for investigation of the PTH resistance, it was confirmed that there was no PTH resistance at the kidney and there was no sign of GNAS mutation. We diagnosed this case as hypocalcemia due to idiopathic hypoparathyroidism for lower serum calcium and traced intact PTH levels and began calcium and calcitriol medicine to treat the hypocalcaemia. Subsequently, her symptoms were improved with normalization of ionized Ca at 2.32 mg/dL (range, 2.3 to 2.53). The results of fine needle aspiration on two nodules of thyroid were suggestive malignancy and she underwent a total thyroidectomy. The biopsy results were papillary microcarcinoma with lymphocytic thyroiditis for two suspicious nodules (sized 1.5×1.0 cm on the left and 2.0×1.0 cm on the right). Among the four parathyroid glands, the left inferior parathyroid gland was not discovered, and the remaining three parathyroid glands were remained during surgery. We used levothyroxine 0.05 mg medication for Hashimoto thyroiditis and insulin determir 12 U and aspart 16 U for glucose control. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "problem": "<Context> A 68-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital in winter due to disturbed consciousness and difficulty with body movements. Approximately two weeks prior, he had experienced fever and generalized edema. Thirteen days before admission, his family physician prescribed levofloxacin at 500 mg/day, furosemide at 20 mg/day, and spironolactone at 25 mg/day for seven days. The patient complied with this and became afebrile, and his edema disappeared. Two days before admission, his wife noticed that his speech was slurred, and he was only able to understand short and simple sentences. On the day of admission, he could not communicate and was unable to speak comprehensibly. He could not move by himself. His past medical history included cerebral palsy with lower limb atrophy, but he could walk using a frame. He had normal mental and intellectual development. He also had chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the stage of G4A3 due to nephrosclerosis and a horseshoe kidney, with a creatinine level of around 2.5 mg/dL. He had been treated with nifedipine, doxazosin, and febuxostat and did not use any over-the-counter supplements or illegal drugs.\nUpon physical examination, his blood pressure was 65/40 mm Hg, his heart rate was 40 bpm, his respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 27.9 °C. His consciousness was registered as E4V1M4 (E: Eye opening, V: Best verbal response, M: Best motor response) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Accidental hypothermia was suspected, because his room had been cold and he had stayed there throughout the night. He was rewarmed immediately, and his body temperature increased to 35.7 °C, after which his vital signs became stable. However, his consciousness level remained abnormal, and he also showed myoclonus in both upper limbs. The deep tendon reflex of the biceps was normal. Laboratory findings showed a white cell count of 2700/μL, a hemoglobin level of 5.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 16.5 × 104/μL, albumin at 2.0 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase at 137 U/L, alanine aminotransferase at 50 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 288 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase at 13 U/L, blood urea nitrogen at 82.3 mg/dL, creatinine at 3.84 mg/dL, sodium at 142 mEq/L, calcium at 8.0 mg/dL, glucose at 101 mg/dL, thyroid-stimulating hormone at 9.29 μU/mL, free T4 at 1.03 ng/mL, and vitamin B1 at 3.9 g/dL. Antithyroid peroxidase antibody and antithyroglobulin antibody were undetectable. An arterial blood gas analysis did not show CO2 elevation and indicated mild metabolic acidosis. An electrocardiogram initially showed first-degree atrioventricular block, which became normal sinus rhythm after rewarming. Head-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations showed no abnormalities, and an electroencephalogram showed generalized slowing waves. CSF was shown to have a cell count of 0/μL, a protein concentration of 68 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 65 mg/dL. Levofloxacin-associated encephalopathy and myoclonus were suspected based on the patient’s history of high levofloxacin dosages and present renal function.\nThe patient was treated through the administration of fluids and furosemide with the aim of levofloxacin being excreted in his urine. Although the patient produced more urine, his creatinine did not return to basal level, and his consciousness level did not improve. Hemodialysis was carried out on days 3 and 5 after admission, and his consciousness level improved and completely recovered by day 7 (). The myoclonus disappeared four days after admission. An electroencephalogram on day 15 showed no slowing waves. His Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale registered at 7 points, which indicated a probable relationship between his symptoms and adverse drug reactions to levofloxacin []. Sixteen days after admission, the patient was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation. Later, we measured the concentration of levofloxacin in the reserved samples of plasma or CSF, obtained during hospitalization. The plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were 16.9, 16.2, 2.44, 0.61, and 0.71 μg/mL on days 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 after admission, respectively ().

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old man.\nOccipital headache when concentrating.\nNo family history of hypertension.\nNothing of note.\nNo history of smoking. About 350 ml/day of beer.\nThe patient was diagnosed with hypertension at about 40 years of age, and he has since been taking slow-release nifedipine tablets. Blood pressure was controlled at about 130/80 mmHg, but in April 200X, he began to experience non-pulsatile occipital headaches and dizziness when concentrating on work or whenever mental focus was required. These conditions were severe enough to impair activities of daily living. For example, on several occasions he had to excuse himself from meetings. Occipital headaches had no relation to nifedipine administration. Also, when the patient experienced occipital headaches, systolic blood pressure was about 50 mmHg higher than usual. His family physician ordered blood tests and head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but no abnormalities were found. Since the involvement of psychological stress was suspected, the patient was referred to our department at the end of May and was admitted for thorough testing on June 5.\nHeight 161.6 cm, body weight 59.7 kg, body temperature 36.5°C, blood pressure 120/64 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 60 beats/min and regular. No yellowing of the bulbar conjunctiva. No anemia using palpebral conjunctiva hue. No abnormalities in the chest, heart, or respiratory sounds. No abdominal abnormality. No leg edema. No neurological abnormality. Marked bilateral palmar sweating.\nThe patient was very detail-oriented and a perfectionist. For several years, he had served as a board member of a company as well as a few community and elderly groups. In April, he was particularly busy and under great stress due to personal relationship issues involving some group members.\nNo abnormal blood count findings. Blood biochemical analysis showed no abnormalities, including total cholesterol (205 mg/dl) and triglycerides (128 mg/dl). Endocrinological testing conducted at rest in the early morning showed no abnormalities: plasma rennin activity, 1.8 ng/ml/hr; aldosterone, 81.0 pg/ml; adrenaline, 27 pg/ml; and noradrenaline (NA) 162 pg/ml. There was no cardiac dilatation (by chest radiography), no adrenal abnormalities (by abdominal ultrasonography [US]), no signs of carotid artery constriction (by US), no abnormality in the skull (by head MRI), and no stenosis (by MRA). The head-up tilt test did not confirm orthostatic hypotension.\nEven after admission, the patient experienced non-pulsatile pain accompanied by heaviness in the back of the head whenever thinking or frustrated. Before admission, the patient was taking four antihypertensive agents (valsartan [80 mg], slow-release nifedipine [40 mg], temocapril [2 mg], and trichloromethiazide [2 mg]), but after admission, use of trichloromethiazide and temocapril was discontinued in that order. To investigate the effects of psychological stress on the patient, the first MDT was performed to measure changes in blood pressure, HR, and plasma NA (the MDT protocol is described below). At 2 min after starting MDT, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased by up to 38 and 36 mmHg, respectively, before gradually decreasing. In addition, occipital headache was experienced at 2 min after the start of MDT and persisted for 15 min (Fig. ). On June 21, use of slow-release nifedipine was discontinued and 10 mg of cilnidipine was started. At 1 week after the start of cilnidipine therapy, a second MDT was performed, and the maximum increase in SBP was limited to 27 mmHg. The patient did not experience further bouts of occipital headache. Cilnidipine dosage was increased to 20 mg, and a third MDT showed that the maximum increase in SBP was 21 mmHg. Furthermore, maximum increase in HR during MDT while the patient was on nifedipine therapy was 48 beats/min, and this increase was also suppressed by cilnidipine (at both 10- and 20-mg doses).\nTo investigate the effects of psychological stress on sympathetic nerve activities, the level of plasma NA was measured before and immediately after MDT (Fig. ). Plasma NA increased immediately after MDT by 336 pg/ml while the patient was on nifedipine therapy, but the increase was smaller when the patient was on 10 or 20 mg of cilnidipine (139 and 90 pg/ml, respectively). Cilnidipine thus suppressed blood pressure, HR, and sympathetic activity during the MDT.\nHowever, several days after increasing the cilnidipine dosage to 20 mg, the patient experienced a different type of dizziness when standing up to go to the bathroom. Another head-up tilt test was conducted, and at 1 min after standing up, the patient had a 24 mmHg decrease in SBP. As cilnidipine was considered to have suppressed the sympathetic activation associated with standing, the cilnidipine dosage was reduced to 10 mg. A subsequent head-up tilt test revealed no orthostatic hypotension, and the patient no longer experienced dizziness on standing. While in the hospital, the patient's stress coping skills were evaluated. Although excessive workload was thought to be the cause of his psychological stress, the patient could not abruptly resign from his various posts. He was thus instructed to lighten his workload as much as possible and was discharged on July 11. Since then, he has been free of occipital headaches, and his clinical course has been favorable.\nAt 1 h before start of the test, a line was placed in the right forearm to collect venous blood samples. After resting for ≥ 30 min, the MDT was performed for 10 min. After the end of the MDT, the patient was asked to rest for 10 min. During this time, blood pressure and HR were measured every min. Plasma NA level was measured immediately before and immediately after MDT. MDT was performed three times during hospitalization, and all three tests were administered at about 11:00 A.M. by the same investigator. To avoid habituation to the test, the patient was instructed to start drawing from different positions in different directions and each test was conducted at least seven days apart. Self-reported introspection was recorded following each test and these introspections showed that the degree of frustration experienced during the MDT was comparable each time. Furthermore, during all three tests, the patient was medicated with valsartan. Nifedipine (40 mg) had been discontinued after the first MDT (after breakfast). Cilnidipine administration (10 mg, after breakfast) was initiated on June 21, and the second MDT was performed on June 28. Starting on July 1, cilnidipine dosage was increased to 20 mg (after breakfast), and the third MDT was performed on July 7. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

She was resistant to care, was having persistent vocalization, and was hallucinating. Functionally, she required full assistance with all her ADLs. Her past medical history included early-onset dementia of Alzheimer's type, severe, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and dysphagia. The patient did not have a history of psychiatric illness including anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, or psychiatric hospitalizations.\nHer medications at admission to our unit were multivitamins, citalopram 20 mg po daily, simvastatin 40 mg po daily, Vitamin D3 1000 IU po daily, calcium carbonate 600 mg po bid, valproic acid sprinkles 375 mg po twice daily, docusate 100 mg po twice daily, and risperidone 0.5 mg po twice daily.\nOur review of record, indicates that the patient was being treated with citalopram, valproic acid sprinkles, and risperidone for the behavioral disturbances associated with her dementia. It is unclear exactly as to when the valproic acid sprinkles was started, but it appears that the patient was taking this drug for at least the last month prior to her hospitalization.\nOn admission examination, the patient was noted to be perseveratively calling out and crying. Her vital signs were stable, and she was uncooperative to the examination. She was underweight, at 66 inches in height, 99 lbs in weight, and body mass index (BMI) = 16 kg/m2. Despite her history of hypertension, her blood pressure (BP) on admission was low at 96/57 mm hg. She was noted to have a dysconjugate gaze. She had marked jerking movements of her upper extremities consistent with myoclonus. Muscle tone was increased, and it was difficult to assess for cogwheeling, as patient was unable to voluntarily relax her extremities. Myoclonus in her lower extremities was also noted when her feet were dorsiflexed. She was disoriented to time, place, and person and was unable to participate in a formal cognitive testing.\nLaboratory examination on admission revealed a low serum albumin of 3.4 gm/dL. Her ammonia level was low normal at 4 umol/L. Her valproic acid level was 39 mg/L, a level generally considered to be subtherapeutic for patients with seizure disorders. Sodium was 143 meq/L, potassium was 3.7 meq/L, chloride was 104 meq/L, bicarbonate was 33 meq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 0.7 mg/dL, glucose was 91 mg/dL, serum calcium was 8.5 mg/dL, aspartate transamisase (AST) was 7 iu/L, and alanine transaminase (ALT) was 21 iu/L. Vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Complete blood count (CBC) was normal with a white cell count of 8100/cmm, a hemoglobin level of 13.7 gm/dL, and a hematocrit of 41.2%.\nFollowing the initial evaluation, the VPA dose was decreased and then discontinued, with complete resolution of her myoclonus. Quetiapine was started and titrated to 25 mg po at noon and 12.5 mg po at 5 pm for agitation. Because of her late afternoon agitation, risperidone 0.5 mg was increased from twice a day to 0.5 mg po three times a day, with the additional dose given in the early afternoon.

Volume of upper limb pulses appeared to be bilaterally equal on palpation. However, right radial pulse was collapsing in nature along with radio-femoral delay. Grade four early diastolic murmur, loudest in aortic area, with palpable thrill-radiating to left sternal border was present. Examination of other systems and investigations were unremarkable. Two dimensional (2D) echocardiogram revealed narrowing of thoracic and abdominal aorta to 9 mm with a high blood flow velocity of 2.0 m/s. Ascending aorta and aortic arch were dilated along with moderate AR. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58% with normal biventricular systolic function and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Doppler performed 5 years back showed high resistant flows in common, internal and external carotid arteries bilaterally, with possible proximal stenosis of right subclavian artery (SCA).\nBaseline vitals in the operating room were as follows: Heart rate of 115/min, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) of 188/78 mmHg in right upper limb and SPO2 of 97% [].\nAnaesthetic plan was lumbar epidural anaesthesia with invasive radial arterial BP monitoring prior to placing the epidural. Since the doppler report showed possible stenosis of right SCA, left radial arterial line was secured and the invasive BP (IBP) was 112/55 mmHg. Lower limb arterial monitoring was not considered due to narrowing of thoraco-abdominal aorta. Epidural catheter was secured in L1-L2 intervertebral space, and the position was confirmed with test dose of 3 ml of 2% preservative free lignocaine. Patient was positioned supine with a wedge under the right buttock. To achieve a sensory block up to T6 level, 10 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was given in 5-ml increments every 10 minutes. There was a drop in IBP to 80/40 mmHg along with a drop of NIBP to 122/60 mmHg after the epidural over 10 minutes. We treated the drop in IBP with 6 mg ephedrine boluses to avoid any cerebral or utero-placental hypoperfusion. There was ill-sustained increase in IBP and NIBP after each bolus (3 boluses provided). BP increased up to 122/64 mmHg, while the NIBP increased up to 198/94 mmHg after the third bolus of ephedrine. Patient complained of headache after each bolus of ephedrine. Possibility of over treating IBP leading to headache was considered after ruling out possibilities of monitoring error. On-table doppler ultrasound of upper limb arteries was performed specifically looking at the luminal diameter and amplitude of pulsations. Both were reduced in the left radial and axillary artery when compared to the right radial and axillary artery. Right radial pulsation was collapsing in nature, which is expected in AR. Thereafter, we considered treating using the NIBP values of the right upper limb. Meanwhile, the baby delivered was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit in view of prematurity. Rest of the intra-operative period was uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in a high dependency unit. Post-operative aortogram revealed normal right SCA and diffuse disease of the left distal SCA, which confirmed our intra-operative findings. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. Because the congestive heart failure history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5.

    "problem": "<Context> A 35-year-old nulligravid woman presented to our gynecology outpatient clinic of the King Fahad Medical City, Saudi Arabia, with gradual distension of the abdomen and discomfort over 1 year. The swelling was accompanied by mild lower abdominal pain, constipation, and poor appetite. There was no history of vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary symptoms, colicky pain, and fainting attacks. She had no previous history of any illnesses, allergies, or operations. She denied the use of any medications. There was no family history of malignancies. Her menarche commenced at the age of 12 years.\nHer body weight was 80 kg, her height was 161 cm, and her BMI was 30.86 kg/m2. Physical examination demonstrated that there was no jaundice, edema, or lymphadenopathy, and secondary sexual characteristics were evident. Abdominal examination revealed a large ill-defined pelvic-abdominal cystic mass extending from the pubis up to the umbilicus with an abdominal girth of 95 cm. There was dullness upon percussion but no tenderness. Upon auscultation, the intestinal sounds were normal. Her external genitalia were normal with no abnormality detected by speculum examination. Bimanual examination revealed a normal-sized uterus, and a cystic mass was felt bilaterally near the posterior fornix that was approximately 7 cm in diameter.\nTransabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound were performed, which showed a bilateral pelvic multiloculated cystic mass approximately 13 × 10 cm in the right ovary and 6 × 5 cm in the left ovary, with evidence of solid components and septations. The uterus was normal, and endometrial thickness was 8 mm. CA-125 was 30IU/mL, and other tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen, beta human chorionic gonadotropin) were within normal ranges. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were consistent with bilateral multiloculated cystic ovarian lesions. The cyst on the right side measured 13.6 × 15.4 × 6.8 cm, while that on the left side measured 3.6 × 7.4 × 3.1 cm in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions (Fig. ). Thus, an ovarian cystadenoma was suspected. No abdominopelvic metastases or lymphadenopathy was reported. After the patient was counseled, she signed informed consent for laparoscopic bilateral ovarian cystectomy. The procedure was performed without complications. Intraoperatively, both ovarian cyst walls were identified and removed using blunt dissection with countertraction without disruption of the capsule. The specimen was intact, placed in the Endo Catch and sent for histopathology.\nHistopathological examination revealed that the right cyst was approximately 14 cm with surface papillary excrescences, containing straw-colored fluid (Fig. ). The left ovarian cyst was approximately 6 cm and was multiloculated with thick walls. Microscopic examination of the right ovary showed that the cyst wall was lined by simple columnar lining with papillary proliferations, while the left cyst revealed a thick wall with endocervical-like mucinous cell lining (Fig. ). The diagnosis was made as right ovarian benign serous cystadenoma and left ovarian benign mucinous cystadenoma.\nThe postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. She returned back to her normal daily activities and was advised to follow-up after 4 weeks. Consent for publication of the report was obtained from the patient as well as from the institutional review board (IRB). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 58-year-old Japanese man with an 8-year history of T2DM had a symptom of pain in his right lower leg and visited the emergency room in Kawasaki Medical School. Previously, he had felt the same pain in the same region when his blood glucose was very high and thereby he was diagnosed as having T2DM 8 years before.\nHe had acute osteomyelitis in his right lower leg when he was a baby. Except for this, he had no past history. He had no remarkable family history. He was a barber; he smoked tobacco (pack-years = 0.75 pack/day × 40 years) and he drank alcohol every day. After the episode of acute osteomyelitis when he was a baby, there was no problem in his legs until he had general fatigue and felt pain in his right lower leg at the age of 50. He visited the emergency room. His vital signs were as follows: heart rate 76 beats/minute, blood pressure 116/70 mmHg, and body temperature 36.4 °C. He had a symptom of slight local swelling and heat sensation in the same area with pain in his right lower leg, but there were no findings in physical and neurological examinations. In addition, there was no ulcer or injury on his skin surface. Laboratory data (Table ) were as follows: white blood cell count, 7400/μL (neutrophil 64.7%); C-reactive protein (CRP), 2.50 mg/dl; plasma glucose, 382 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 11.7%. He was diagnosed as having T2DM, but he had no diabetic complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lower limbs showed an abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg (Fig. ). An axial T1-weighted (T1W) image of his right lower leg showed a slightly lower intensity, and an axial T2-weighted (T2W) image showed a markedly higher intensity (Fig. , upper panels). Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic osteomyelitis and T2DM. We thought that it would be better to hospitalize him and start administering antibiotics via a drip, but he did not agree to the hospitalization. Therefore, as an alternative, we started 300 mg/day of cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate and insulin therapy (18 units of aspart) on an out-patient basis. After starting insulin therapy, his blood glucose level gradually decreased, and his leg pain was also gradually mitigated. Finally, his leg pain disappeared 2 weeks later. His CRP became within normal range, and 3 months later the focus in his right lower leg was markedly reduced on MRI. In addition, the focus was not detected in ultrasonography of the right tibia site. Just in case, however, we continued antibiotics therapy for 4 months. Since his glycemic control was improved 2 months later, we stopped insulin therapy and started orally administered anti-diabetic drugs.\nHe was then followed up as an out-patient with T2DM for approximately 8 years. The medication at that time was 1000 mg/day of metformin, 25 mg/day of alogliptin, 15 mg/day of pioglitazone, and 50 mg/day of ipragliflozin. However, he did not take the medicine for approximately 8 months on his own judgement at the age of 58. After his interruption of therapy for 8 months, he felt the same pain in the same right lower leg again. He immediately visited our hospital. He had symptoms of slight local swelling and heat sensation together with pain in the same area in his right lower leg, but again there were no findings in physical and neurological examinations at this time. His vital signs were as follows: heart rate 99 beats/minute, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, and body temperature 37.0 °C. He had a symptom of slight local swelling and heat sensation in the same area with pain in his right lower leg, but there was no ulcer or injury on his skin surface. Laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 6680/μL (neutrophil 63.4%); CRP, 0.32 mg/dl; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 31 mm/hour; plasma glucose, 652 mg/dL; HbA1c, 6.9%; glycoalbumin 46.1%. Other laboratory data were as follows: red blood cell, 476 × 104/μL; hemoglobin (Hb), 15.9 g/dL; platelet, 25.1/μL; total protein (TP), 7.6 g/dL; albumin (Alb), 4.4 g/dL. Liver and renal function were within normal range as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 39 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 50 U/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 51 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 172 U/L; creatinine (Cre), 0.54 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 13 mg/dL; Na, 131 mEq/L; K, 4.4 mEq/L; Cl, 96 mEq/L. Pathogenic bacteria were not detected. He had no diabetic complications, probably because his glycemic control was relatively good before the interruption of therapy. His leg MRI showed a spreading of the abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg (Fig. , lower panels). We hospitalized him in our institution but he did not agree to undergo surgery for remission. Therefore, we started 3.0 g/day of sulbactam sodium/ampicillin sodium and insulin therapy (24 units of aspart and 20 units of glargine). After starting insulin therapy, his blood glucose level gradually decreased, and his leg pain was also gradually mitigated. Local swelling and heat sensation disappeared approximately 5 days later. Finally, his leg pain disappeared approximately 2 weeks later, and he was discharged from our hospital. Just in case, however, we continued antibiotics therapy (450 mg/day of rifampicin and 4 g/day of trimethoprim) for approximately 2 months. After a total of 3-month antibiotics therapy during hospitalization and after discharge, we stopped antibiotics therapy. He was then followed up for approximately 6 months, and his leg MRI showed a reduction of the abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg. He had no symptoms and/or problems, and his inflammation markers remained within normal levels for at least 6 months. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "287.722",
    "Upper Limit": "318.008",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 131.0 mEq. To convert from 131.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 131.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 131.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 131.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 131.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 131.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 13.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 652.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 131.0 + (13.0 / 2.8) + (13.0 / 18) = 302.865 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 302.865 mmol/L.

His disease course was complicated by frequent admissions for recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\nAt the time of the referral, the patient was admitted with a severe DKA and a staphylococcal bacteremia complicated by abdominal abscesses formation, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis. He was managed under the supervision of the infectious diseases service. Upon his evaluation, the patient’s height was 120 cm (<3rd percentile) and weight was 25 kg (<3rd percentile). He had coarse facial features, abdominal distension, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 16 cm, and Tanner stage I for pubic hair and testicular size.

There was no pulsus parodoxus. Examination of the head and neck showed pale conjunctiva, no palpable lymphadenopathy, jugular venous distension or bruits. Auscultation of the chest revealed scattered rhonchi. The patient was mildly tachycardic with no S3 or S4 heart sounds, murmurs or rubs appreciated. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, clubbing, cyanosis or edema and stools were guaiac negative.\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with low voltage QRS complexes; electrical alternans were not present. The chest radiograph showed a very minimal pleural effusion with no cardiomegaly, infiltrates or masses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed a white blood-cell count of 12,900/L, with a normal differential, and a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.2 g/dl and 23.4%, respectively. The platelet count was 387 thousand/L. The red cell indices were microcytic and iron studies revealed an iron deficiency anemia. Liver function tests were normal. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 167 U/L (within normal limits). The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 16.49 mcIU/ml and the free T3 was 57 mcg/ml.\nThe patient was admitted for anemia and worked up for a gastrointestinal bleed. Three units packed red blood cells were transfused. Upper endoscopy revealed a mass just below the gastroesophageal junction and three nonbleeding gastric ulcers. To further evaluate the gastric mass, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed demonstrating a 30 × 17 mm polypoid mass visualized in the gastric cardia limited to the mucosa/submucosa. The biopsy revealed gastric adenocarcinoma, staged as T1N0M0 by EUS, and was Helicobacter pylori-negative.\nA two-dimensional echocardiogram was preformed to evaluate an 8-month old pericardial effusion. It demonstrated a 2.0 × 2.7 cm mass associated with the right atrium (RA). To better define the mass and its anatomic relationship within the RA, several imaging procedures were performed: 1) transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a 5.7 cm2 shaped echodensity within the wall of the RA and a second, 16 cm2 echodensity, that extended across the atrioventricular groove (Figure ); 2) a contrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis negative for metastasis, but significant for a large pericardial effusion without pericardial thickening and a 2.6 × 2.1 cm filling defect in the right atrial appendage (Figure ); and 3) a cardiac MRI demonstrating a homogenous enhancing mass along the lateral wall of the right atrium. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic region in the heart corresponding to the mass observed on CT.\nAt this point, our differential diagnosis included a primary gastric adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the heart as well as two separate primary neoplastic processes (one involving the heart and one involving the stomach).\nTo determine the etiology of the cardiac mass, a biopsy was accomplished via a pericardial window through an anterolateral thoracotomy. At thoracotomy, the parietal pericardium appeared normal. Visual inspection revealed several nodular areas over the body of the right atrium, superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). There was no evidence of a thickened, constrictive layer surrounding the heart. Two hundred milliliters of straw-colored fluid was recovered from the pericardial cavity. The fluid was negative for malignant cells and consisted of a few benign and reactive mesothelial cells mixed with inflammatory cells and proteinaceous debris. Viral, bacterial and mycobacterial cultures of the pericardial fluid were negative. Biopsy revealed a normal parietal pericardium and myocardium. However, the visceral pericardium showed a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate diagnostic of epicarditis (Figure ). After thoracotomy, the patient had a partial gastrectomy to remove the adenocarcinoma. The postoperative course was complicated by infection, requiring a 3-month stay in the intensive care unit. During this time, there was no evidence suggestive of constrictive physiology.

Complete blood cell count showed aggravated thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 18,000/μL, neutropenia with neutrophil count of 619/μL, and WBC of 1360/μL, and hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL. On suspicion of adverse drug reaction, FA was stopped immediately, reduced glutathione was prescribed for hepatoprotective therapy. Given that the patient's temperature remained normal for 10 days, other antibiotic was not used. One day after discontinuation of FA, nose bleeding occurred with a nadir of platelet count of 4000/μL. However, WBC count increased slightly to 2090/μL, neutrophil to 1831/μL. Due to the severity of low platelet count, transfusion of random-donor platelet concentrates was used, but thrombocytopenia did not improve immediately. At the same time, bone marrow aspiration showed myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, suggesting increasing peripheral destruction (Fig. ). Five days after cessation of FA, jaundice resolved and the hematologic index returned to the level before FA. Throughout the period of FA treatment and after discontinuation of FA, the other drugs she took concurrently were entecavir tablets and polyene phosphatidylcholine injection, the former had been taking for 2 months prior to this admission, the latter was administered for 22 days from this admission to discharge. The serial data of WBC, neutrophil, and platelet counts are shown in Figure . And that of bilirubin are shown in Figure .

His C-reactive protein was 0.16 mg/dl. His serum electrolyte tests were within normal limits, including calcium and inorganic phosphorus. In addition, his brain natriuretic peptide was raised at 605.1 pg/dl. His blood cultures were negative.\nA chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram suggested left ventricular hypertrophy with nonspecific ST-T wave changes (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed MAC and a highly mobile mass (8 × 6 mm) attached to the ventricular side of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (Fig. ). The echogenicity of the mass was similar to MAC. The mitral valve was mildly thickened with mild mitral stenosis. Left ventricular systolic function was normal. Cardiac computed tomography demonstrated a calcified cardiac mass in the mitral annulus with heavy MAC (Fig. ). As the mass was highly mobile, suggesting a high risk of embolization, he underwent surgical resection of the mass. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a severely calcified mitral annulus and attachment of the calcific mass to the P2 segment of the mitral valve. Surgical resection was performed successfully.\nMacroscopic findings of the resected mass showed a yellowish colored and partially calcified mass (7 mm in diameter; Fig. ). A histopathological examination revealed multiple nodular amorphous calcifications and fibrous connective tissue. There were no identifiable myxoma or malignancy cells (Fig. ). Consequently, the diagnosis of CAT was confirmed.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 131.0 mEq. To convert from 131.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 131.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 131.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 131.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 131.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 131.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 4.5 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 109.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 131.0 + (4.5 / 2.8) + (4.5 / 18) = 269.663 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 269.663 mmol/L.

She was being managed at a tertiary health care center in South Nigeria for approximately 4 years. She had been on conservative management but had been having a progressive worsening of her biochemical parameters with a progressive increase in her serum urea and creatinine and serum potassium.\nIn addition, the patient was also getting progressively anemic. The patient eventually became uremic with uremic encephalopathy, uremic gastritis, and pulmonary edema. On account of the patient's clinical condition, doctors at the tertiary hospital where the patient was being managed had prescribed hemodialysis, but the patient refused hemodialysis because she was advised to have a blood transfusion prior to hemodialysis on account of severe anemia. She refused transfusion on account of being a Jehovah's Witness and discharged herself from the tertiary hospital to a private dialysis center.\nOn examination at presentation, the patient was in respiratory distress, markedly pale (packed cell volume [PCV] 15%) with marked edema. The patient also had bilateral mid-zone and low-zone crepitations. The abdomen was distended, full with epigastric tenderness. The liver was palpably enlarged 3 cm below the right costal margin. The spleen and kidneys were not palpably enlarged.\nCNS examination showed that the patient was well oriented in time, place, and person. There was no focal neurologic deficit, but there was moderate asterixis.\nInitial electrolyte, urea, and creatinine results were as follows: urea – 215.8 mg/dL, creatinine – 7.45 mg/dL, Na – 132 mmol/L, K – 5.24 mmol/L, Cl – 108 mmol/L, and HCO3– 13.2 mmol/L.\nThe patient was on prednisolone, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan.\nComputed tomography (CT) done previously did not reveal any deficit.\nThe scanogram was unremarkable. Five millimeter pre- and post-intravenous contrast-enhanced axial CT slices were taken from the base of the skull to the vertex. There was no shift of the midline brain structures. The lateral ventricles, third and fourth ventricles, as well as the basal cistern appeared grossly normal. The paranasal sinuses as well as the mastoid air cells appeared grossly normal. The orbit was grossly normal with no demonstrable defect in the bony orbit or intraocular mass lesion. The overlying soft tissue appeared grossly normal.\nConclusion: Normal cranial CT scan.\nPCV done was 15%.\nThe patient and her relations were counseled for dialysis and blood transfusion. They revealed that they left the tertiary health center when they were told that the patient needed a blood transfusion before she could be dialyzed which they declined on religious grounds. They claimed even in life-threatening conditions; they would not accept a blood transfusion.\nThe patient was dialyzed, and over the next few weeks, she gradually improved clinically even though hemodialysis was markedly irregular.\nThe patient continued to improve and returned to the tertiary hospital for the continuation of dialysis since the PCV was now 23% and could be dialyzed without a mandatory transfusion.\nThe patient presented again in a few weeks with a different complaint. She was speaking English with a distinctly American accent. It had started 3 days prior to presentation. She claimed that the accent was distressing and embarrassing and a source of worry to herself and her family.\nThe examination revealed a calm patient. There was no neurologic deficit. Mini-mental state examination was within reference values. The patient scored 26. The speech had normal content, but the accent was American and markedly different from her previous speech pattern. The patient had a slightly elevated mood.\nHer past medical history showed that she had a previous episode 6 years earlier when she recovered from a coma at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital Intensive Care Unit. She claimed that the symptoms resolved spontaneously after a few days. There has been no other episode since that time.\nAs stated earlier, a previous CT did not reveal any abnormality. PCV was 27%. All other systems were grossly normal.\nUrea and creatinine results showed urea of 126 mg/dl and creatinine was 4.5 mg/dl. There was no asterixis. There were also no gross abnormalities on cranial CT scan, and uraemic encepalopathy had resolved. On account of these, a diagnosis of FAS post uraemic encepalopathy with possible hypomania was made.\nThe patient was referred to the mental health physician and was eventually placed on haloperidol 2.5 mg/dL and symptoms resolved gradually over the next 2–3 weeks.\nHaloperidol was gradually stopped over a 1 month period, and there has been no relapse over the past 10 months.

    "problem": "<Context> An 80-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of a 2-day history of fever. She had no relevant medical history except for hypertension, for which she had been prescribed amlodipine (5 mg/day). She was taking no other medications. She was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. She caught a cold 10 days before admission and recovered 1 week later. Four days before admission, she experienced general malaise without a fever. Two days before admission, she suddenly developed a fever (38.7°C) with left ventral neck pain. She was examined by her home doctor and prescribed oral cefdinir (300 mg/day), but her fever persisted. She was then admitted to our hospital.\nOn admission, her height was 141 cm, weight was 47 kg, body temperature was 38.0°C, and blood pressure was 126/62 mmHg. Her heart rate was 90 beats/min with a regular rhythm. A physical examination showed no major abnormalities except for mild and tender swelling of the left anterior region of the neck. Chest and abdominal X-ray films and an electrocardiogram were normal. Laboratory tests showed a high WBC count of 23.4 × 109 cells/L (reference range, 3.5–9.0 × 109 cells/L), lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 243 U/L (reference range, 124–222 U/L), blood urea nitrogen concentration of 21.1 mg/dL (reference range, 8–20 mg/dL), creatinine concentration of 1.16 mg/dL (reference range, 0.46–0.79 mg/dL), and CRP concentration of 19.41 mg/dL (reference range, 0.00–0.14 mg/dL). The fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c concentrations were 5.3 mmol/L (reference range, 3.9–5.5 mmol/L) and 5.5% (reference range, <6.0%), respectively, indicating the absence of diabetes. Urinary findings were normal. Rapid antigen tests for influenza, pneumococcus, and mycoplasma were negative. Thyroid function tests showed a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 0.18 mU/L (reference range, 0.35–4.94 mU/L) and increased free T4 concentration of 3.06 ng/dL (reference range, 0.70–1.48 ng/dL). Ultrasonography revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with a heterogeneous texture and multiple confluent nodules that were not well-circumscribed and were predominantly hypoechoic, suggesting preexisting adenomatous goiter. Notably, a round, heterogeneous, hypoechoic lesion without a distinct capsule, which was obviously different from the other goiter nodules, was observed in the left lobe of the thyroid gland; it measured approximately 26 × 22 mm (Fig. A). Plain CT of the neck also showed multiple nodules in the thyroid gland but provided no further information regarding the inside of the nodules. Based on these findings, US-guided FNAB targeting a hypoechoic lesion was performed to discriminate between AST and subacute thyroiditis soon after admission. Although FNAB did not yield pus, cultures of the thyroid aspirate needle washout, blood, urine, and sputum were carried out. Although the definitive diagnosis was unclear on admission, oral prednisolone (30 mg/day) was prescribed due to suspicion for subacute thyroiditis. Intravenous administration of aminobenzylpenicillin (8 g/day) was simultaneously performed because the possibility of AST was not completely negated.\nOn day 2, Gram-positive cocci were detected from the blood culture samples, and administration of the oral prednisolone was discontinued. The patient's general status improved, and she became afebrile on day 4. On day 5, the Gram-positive cocci detected from the blood culture samples were identified as S. agalactiae. Notably, S. agalactiae was also detected from the culture samples of the thyroid aspirate needle washout on admission. The urine culture revealed a small amount of Escherichia coli (1.0 × 104/mL) and S. agalactiae (1.0 × 103/mL); the sputum culture detected no remarkable pathogenic bacteria. All of the S. agalactiae strains detected from blood, biopsy needle washout, and urine showed the same antibiotic sensitivity. Gynecologic and urologic evaluations revealed no significant abnormalities. Vaginal secretion culture was performed on day 5, but S. agalactiae was not detected. Cytological examination of the FNAB samples on admission revealed an abundance of inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes (Fig. A), and no remarkable cellular atypia of the follicular epithelial cells (Fig. B). Accordingly, we diagnosed the patient with AST due to S. agalactiae infection. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland on day 6 revealed that the hypoechoic lesion inside the left lobe had slightly increased in size (29 × 27 mm) and that the internal echogenicity was lower than that on day 1 (Fig. B). The patient's left neck pain resolved and her WBC count normalized on day 10, and her CRP concentration normalized on day 14. Administration of intravenous aminobenzylpenicillin was discontinued on day 14, and she was discharged from our hospital on day 16.\nUS examination was repeated 1 month after discharge. The size of the hypoechoic lesion was markedly reduced (17 × 15 mm) (Fig. C), and the thyroid function test results had also normalized. An otolaryngology evaluation and barium swallow failed to reveal a pyriform sinus fistula. At the time of this writing, the patient had been followed up for 6 months with normal thyroid function and no recurrence of AST. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

Family history consisted of a mother-related uncle on dialysis with biopsy-proven Alport disease, another mother-related cousin with kidney involvement, and a grandfather who died due to sudden death at the age of 42. The patient was asymptomatic and normotensive (blood pressure 115/68 mmHg), with a body mass index of 24 and no tobacco consumption. Main laboratory results included hematocrit 44%, glycemia 78 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.07 mg/dL, creatinine clearance of 74 mL/min, sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, serum albumin 4.3 g/dL, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 250 mg/day. A renal ultrasound was normal.\nPodocyturia was assessed as follows: fresh urine samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm during 5 min and the supernatant was discarded; 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2–7.4 was added to the sediment to cover it. Smears were made from each sample on 2% silane-coated slides. The slides were stained with immunofluorescence technique and observed by epifluorescent microscopy. The slides were preincubated with no immune rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline 0.1 M, pH 7.4 (PBS, 1 : 100) at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with a polyclonal anti-synaptopodin antibody (1 : 100, ab109560 Alexa Fluor®, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) overnight in a wet chamber at 4°C. After several rinses in PBS, the slides were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1 : 200 Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for 2 hours at room temperature in a wet chamber. Finally, all the slides were mounted using Fluoroshield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and observed in an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Negative controls were performed without primary antibodies. Podocyte counting was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of ×20. The podocyte count was 1.07 cells per ×20 field; the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 29.9, and the number of podocytes/100 mL of urine was 5.35 (). This result was compared with 5 controls (): 3 males and 2 females; mean age 22 ± 7.2 years with no past history of morbidities; creatinine clearance 108 mL/min; mean 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 88 ± 11 mg/day. The mean podocyte count was 0.12 ± 0.1 cells per ×20 field while the mean number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 10.7 and the mean number of podocytes/100 mL of urine was 1.1. The patient declined to undergo a kidney biopsy but accepted to receive amiloride 5 mg/day orally. After three months of therapy new podocyturia and laboratory results were obtained.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 25 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.14 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 171.0 cm, which is 171.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.71 m. The patient's weight is 81.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 81.0 kg / (1.71 m * 1.71 m) = 27.701 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 27.7, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 171.0 cm, which is 171.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 67.323 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (67.323 (in inches) - 60) = 66.843 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 66.843 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 66.843 kg + 0.4 * (81.0 kg  - 66.843 kg) = 72.506 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 72.506 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 25) * 72.506 * 1) / (1.14 * 72) = 101.586 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 101.586 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 38-year-old man, 166 cm in height and 62 kg in weight, with type I neurofibromatosis presented with pain associated with a large mass in the upper back region. He reported that the mass had been growing gradually since being excised 8 years prior. One day before the current admission, pain had begun to emanate from the mass, which had gradually increased to 7 cm in diameter. Its visible diameter on the surface reportedly kept increasing, and it was 15 cm at the time of the current admission. Preoperative enhanced chest computed tomography revealed a huge mass of 28 cm in width and 8 cm in height (Fig. ).\nOn physical examination, the mass was hard and exhibited heat and tenderness on palpation. Pain from the mass prevented the patient from lying supine, but neck motion was not restricted. Complete blood cell count on admission revealed hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, platelet count 255,000/μL, and leukocyte count 11,500/μL. These parameters had abruptly changed to hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL, platelet count 135,000/μL, and leukocyte count 16,700/μL by 21 hours after admission, and his respective systole, diastole, and heart rate had changed from 120/70 mmHg and 78 beats/min to 130/80 mmHg and 160 beats/min. Due to suspected active bleeding from the mass, emergent evacuation of the hematoma was planned.\nThe patient was admitted to the operating theater in right LDP. A pad was placed beside the right side of his head to maintain it in a neutral position. Electrocardiography and pulse oximetry were continuously monitored. The right radial artery was catheterized under ultrasound guidance for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and frequent arterial blood sampling. During catheterization, the patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen, and a non-inflatable LMA (size 4 i-gelTM, Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) was prepared by lubricating the back, side, and front of the cuff with its orifice spared.\nAnesthesia was then induced via 70 mg ketamine and 3 mg midazolam. In conjunction with the loss of consciousness 70 mg rocuronium was administered to facilitate the insertion of the prepared LMA, and the patient was manually ventilated via a mask. After the train of four count became 0, the LMA was inserted into the laryngopharynx. During its insertion an assistant placed the patient's head in the sniffing position with the head extended and the neck flexed. The anesthesiologist gently introduced the LMA downwards and backwards along the hard palate until resistance against insertion was encountered (Fig. ). After the LMA was inserted the patient was manually ventilated to confirm appropriate placement of the LMA based on detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide from the exhaled gas via capnography. The position of the LMA was secured by taping its integral bite block to the facial skin. The lungs were mechanically ventilated with 50% oxygen. The tidal volume and respiratory rate were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration between 35 and 40 mmHg and a peak airway pressure below 20 cm H2O. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to maintain state entropy values between 40 and 60.\nAt the conclusion of the LMA insertion the patient was placed in a supine position. Pads and pillows were placed behind the head and the body trunk below the mass in order that the mass not be compressed while he was in the supine position (Fig. ). After the LMA was removed from the mouth, the trachea was intubated with a 7.5-mm internal diameter cuffed reinforced endotracheal tube using a portable videolaryngoscope (UEscope, UE Medical Devices Inc., Newton, MA). The capnographic waveform confirmed the placement of the tube into the airway. Auscultation of breath sounds in both lungs ruled out endobronchial placement of the tube. Mechanical ventilation was maintained as described above. Under ultrasound guidance the right internal jugular vein was catheterized to administer blood products and fluids and to monitor central venous pressure continuously. The patient was then placed in a prone position with the head turned to the left (Fig. ).\nThe dependent eye was protected from external compression. Arms were not abducted greater than 90°. Every pressure point was padded. Endotracheal tube positioning, adequate ventilation, and patency of the arterial and venous lines were reassessed after instigation of the prone position. The surgery took 100 minutes. During the surgery the patient received 900 mL of packed red blood cells, 640 mL of fresh frozen plasma, 2890 mL of plasmalyte, and 50 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 to compensate for blood loss. He was also administered 10 mg ephedrine, 20 μg norepinephrine, and 600 mg CaCl2. At the end of the surgery the patient could be placed in a supine position and the neuromuscular blockade maintained by a total of 100 mg rocuronium was reversed via 200 mg sugammadex.\nAfter recovery of spontaneous breathing and consciousness, the endotracheal tube was withdrawn uneventfully. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. On the first postoperative day, he was discharged to the general ward and was satisfied with the results of the surgery (Fig. ). The remnant mass was excised 1 month after the surgery, and at that time-point, the patient had experienced no complications related to the preceding above-described surgery.

There was no obvious ascite in the abdominal cavity. Pulsed Doppler examination revealed low-resistant blood flow (resistance index 0.24). On physical examination, severe adhesion between these tumors and the cul-de-sac was noted. The patient's preoperative CA 125 level was 97.3 U/mL and other tumor markers (CA 19-9, CA 72-4, and CEA) were within normal ranges. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a 6.0×4.8×5.3-cm3 ill-defined, heterogenous signal intensity mass, including mixed cystic and solid portions in the right ovary. This mass was considered as a malignancy (i.e., clear cell carcinoma) likely arising from underlying endometriosis. Between the posterior portion of the right ovarian tumor and the cul-de-sac, there was a 5.5×5.0-cm2 enhanced solid mass with an irregular margin invading into the rectal serosa (). Additionally, there was a 7.2×5.9×6.1-cm3 multi-septated cystic mass in the left ovary () that was considered as a benign mucinous cystadenoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed a high probability of ovarian malignancy involving both ovaries and possibly peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patient's preoperative body mass index was 30.84 kg/m2 (height 158-cm, weight 77 kg).\nThe patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, both pelvic lymph nodes dissection, omentectomy, and appendectomy through median incision at supine position. We performed operation for the basis of epithelial ovarian malignancy. A small number of ascites (500 mL) was present and peritoneal cytology was done. The right ovarian tumor measured at approximately 5.0×5.0-cm2 contained a 2.0×3.0-cm2 solid mass and chocolate-colored fluid. This mass was fixed in the cul-de-sac. It was hard indurated because of cancer infiltration. The left ovary mass measured at roughly 5.0×6.0-cm2 was an inflammatory cyst containing yellowish fluid. Multiple seeding lesions were found at rectal serosa, posterior uterine serosa, and appendix. Multiple whitish nodular lesions of up to 3.0×3.0-cm2 were detected at the omentum. These suspicious lesions were biopsied. No intrauterine tumor was found (). Intra-operative frozen biopsy analysis of the right ovarian tumor showed ESS with endometriosis because proliferative stromal cells with scant nuclear pleomorphism and mitosis were seen. Postoperative course was complicated by a disrupted vaginal stump. There was no other complication.\nFinal pathology was consistent with bilateral ovarian ESS arising from foci of endometriosis and involving the uterine serosa, rectal serosa, parametrium, peritoneum, omentum, and appendix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IIIC). No evidence of tumor was found in the corpus of the uterus or the uterine cavity. Both pelvic lymph nodes were negative for tumor cells. The result of peritoneal cytology was negative for malignant cells. The mitotic activity in the spindle cells in the cellular area was limited to a maximum of two figures per 10 high-power fields. Stromal tissues had the characteristic tongue-like growth pattern (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that neoplastic cells were immunopositive to antibodies specific for cluster of differentiation 10 (CD 10) (), Ki 67 (Ki index 3% to 5%) (), and progesterone receptor (). However, these neoplastic cells were immunonegative to estrogen receptor, desmin, alpha inhibin, calretinin, and actin.\nThe patient's CA 125 level was decreased from 97.3 U/mL before surgery to 38.8 U/mL after surgery. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was started one month after the operation in an effort to suppress the growth of any microscopic tumors. The patient had been taking oral megestrol acetate (Megesia, Dalimpharm, Seoul, Korea) at 160 mg daily for one month. She complained about weight gain. Therefore, the patient had been taking oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Farlutal, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) at 500 mg daily for four months. Six months after the beginning of treatment, her CA 125 level was decreased to 22.7 U/mL. Subsequent Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed no evidence of recurrence or metastases. However, she had complaints of generalized edema. Therefore, we decreased her drug dosages. She was taking oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera, Pfizer) at 200 mg daily for three months. Three months later, she refused further hormonal therapy because of lasting side effects. At that time, an abdominopelvic computed tomography showed no evidence of recurrence. Therefore, we stopped the hormonal therapy and planned regular checkups with pelvic examination, tumor markers, and imaging studies. To date, she has shown no signs of recurrence. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

He had been receiving amlodipine 5 mg and azilsartan 20 mg every morning orally for hypertension. His blood pressure was maintained around 130/70 mmHg. Since he had been diagnosed with pyogenic spondylodiscitis in the fourth/fifth lumber disk region in his forties, general anesthesia was preferred. During the pre-operative examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and laboratory test findings were normal.\nThe patient took only amlodipine besylate on the morning of the surgery. Three hours before anesthesia induction, 5-ALA 20 mg/kg (Alaglio, Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was administrated orally. Just before anesthesia induction, the patient’s blood pressure was 98/61 mmHg and his heart rate 82 beats/min. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 100 mg, rocuronium 50 mg, fentanyl 100 μg, and remifentanil 0.4 μg/kg/min. After 5 min, just before tracheal intubation, his blood pressure decreased to 47/32 mmHg. There were no observed changes in his electrocardiogram, such as ST-T changes or arrhythmia. Although we used phenylephrine at a total dose of 0.2 mg and ephedrine at a total dose of 10 mg over 10 min, hypotension persisted at 50/33 mmHg. Wheezing and erythema were not observed. Administration of 100 mL hydroxyethyl starch bolus for a few minutes was unsuccessful in increasing blood pressure. Transthoracic cardiac ultrasonography revealed normal systolic function, no asynergy, and normal size of the inferior vena cava. Bolus administration of noradrenaline at a total dose of 30 μg over 6 min slightly increased blood pressure to 65/39 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH, 7.350; HCO3− concentration, 23.2 mmol/L; base excess, 2.3 mmol/L; and lactate concentration, 1.7 mmol/L. Following this, bolus administration of adrenaline at a total dose of 30 μg over 9 min elevated the blood pressure from 53/26 to 127/49 mmHg. We decided to perform surgery under continuous administration of adrenaline. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The patient’s blood pressure and heart rate ranged from 72/31 to 94/40 mmHg and from 70 to 85 beats/min, respectively, under the administration of adrenaline at 0.01–0.07 μg/kg/min. On completion of the surgery, he was transferred to the intensive care unit under intubation. Twelve minutes after admission to the intensive care unit, he was extubated as his blood pressure had stabilized at 142/56 mmHg under the administration of adrenaline at 0.03 μg/kg/min. Ten minutes after extubation, adrenaline infusion was discontinued. Although his lactate concentration was 5.3 mmol/L at this time, it decreased to 2.7 mmol/L after 3 h. His blood pressure and heart rate were stable during his intensive care unit stay. The patient was then transferred to the general ward on day 1 postoperatively. He was discharged without any complications 6 days postoperatively. Three months later, dermatologists performed a skin-prick test on him for propofol, rocuronium, and 5-ALA, the results of which were negative. Five months later, he received TUR-Bt under general anesthesia without 5-ALA for recurrence of tumor.

Transtubular K gradient (TTKG) was found to be 2.5.\nSodium and potassium concentrations were measured after every six hours. Liquid therapy with half saline and 60 mEq/L potassium was prescribed to the patient. Since K urine excretion was <15 mEq/L, the cause of hypokalemia was nonrenal excretion. Barter syndrome was thus not the diagnosis.\nTwelve hours after the initiation of the treatment with liquid therapy, Na and K were 136 mEq/L and 3.9 mEq/L, respectively.\nThe patient responded appropriately to Na and K administration.

    "problem": "<Context> We describe the case of a 79-year-old woman, with a history of atrial fibrillation, who had undergone left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device implantation due to contraindication for anticoagulation because of a previous subdural haemorrhage. She was admitted for elective mitral valve replacement due to asymptomatic severe primary mitral regurgitation caused by anterior veil prolapse. An echocardiogram performed a month before showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 56% and normal LV diameters. CT-angiography prior to surgery showed absence of coronary lesions. On admission, cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic murmur in mitral focus at the apex. Lung auscultation was normal. Prior to the surgery, the patient was on acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day. Cardiac surgery was uneventful. Since valve repair was not considered feasible, a Magna Ease biological mitral valve was implanted, maintaining the LAA closure device. Intra-operative transoesophageal echocardiography showed normal functioning of the prosthesis and extracorporeal circulation was concluded. Only low doses of noradrenaline (0.05 μg/kg/min) were required after extracorporeal circulation.\nOn arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient presented with cardiogenic shock: she presented cold extremities and oliguria, systolic blood pressure was 80 mmHg and blood analysis showed metabolic acidosis and elevated serum lactate; therefore, requiring vasoactive agents (noradrenaline at 0.1 μg/kg/min and dobutamine at 5 μg/kg/min). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular rate (150 b.p.m.), which was electrically cardioverted. An ECG performed after cardioversion showed inverted T waves in precordial leads () and pulmonary congestion was evidenced on chest X-ray (). The findings of an echocardiogram showed severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 20%) with mid to distal diffuse hypokinesia that was more severe in the anterior and septal walls, which were almost akinetic. Contractility was much better in all basal segments (, Video S). Mitral prosthesis function was normal. Owing to a suspected coronary complication secondary to cardiac surgery, the patient underwent urgent coronary angiography, which showed absence of significant coronary lesions (, Video S). Troponin I levels were elevated to 0.12 ng/mL (normal value <0.08). Her haemodynamic status was compromised for the following 48 h, during which time vasoactive drugs (noradrenaline ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 μg/kg/min and dobutamine ranging from 5 to 7 μg/kg/min, adjusted to haemodynamic status) and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation were needed. Daily echocardiographic evaluations showed similar images that resembled the first one, with severe LV dysfunction and regional WMA in the mid to distal segments. After 48 h, the haemodynamic status of the patient suddenly improved, leading to progressive suspension of supportive measures; echocardiography at 48 h showed partial recovery of LV systolic function, with an LVEF of 45–50% and mild paradoxical septal motion (, Video S). The electrocardiographic changes also reverted (). Altogether, the clinical picture of the patient was interpreted as a stress cardiomyopathy occurring in the postoperative period of mitral valve replacement surgery. After 1 week, the patient was discharged. Treatment at discharge was acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day. One month later, she was asymptomatic and had low to normal LVEF (50%). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

    "Upper Limit": "3.0",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. Whether Pulmonary Embolism is the #1 diagonsis or is equally likely to being the #1 diagnosis is not reported and so we assume this statement is false, keeping the total unchanged at 0. The patient's heart rate is 150.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5. Because the patient did not have an immobilization for at least 3 days but the patient had a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score increases to 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 3.0. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3.0. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is not reported in the patient note and so we assume that this is absent for the patient, keeping the score at 3.0. The patient's Well's score for pulmonary embolism is 3.0.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 3-year-old, 3.7 kg intact female Miniature Poodle was taken to the Ai’ xin Small Animal Hospital (Cixi, Zhejiang, China), with a heart rate of 138, respiratory rate of 62, rectal temperature of 42°C, and intermittent seizures. The owners initially presented a conflicting and unclear history. The dog received external cooling without any other examination or treatment after admission. After continued conversation with the owners it became clear that the dog may have been intentionally fed an unknown amount of a crystalline-like substance by their friends in a nightclub approximately 1 hour before presentation. They suggested that ‘ice’, the street name of methamphetamine, may have been present in the nightclub. The dog had no medical records in the hospital, but, according to the owner’s description, had no other remarkable past history. After revealing a possible methamphetamine ingestion history the owners disappeared, leaving the dog at the hospital.\nThe dog was taken to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Zhejiang University by a referral veterinarian, and was provided with continuing external cooling (ice packs). By this time it was about 2.5 hours beyond ingestion when the dog was finally presented at the emergency room. The referral veterinarian reported that the dog was progressively displaying flushed skin and extensive petechiae in abdominal region (Figure \n). It also had started to develop watery bloody diarrhea, and had had 3 short seizures (about 50 seconds for each time seizure) on the way to the hospital. Physical examination revealed a rectal temperature of 41.5°C, heart rate of 186 beats per minute with no premature ventricular contractions or other arrhythmias, panting respiration, systolic blood pressure of 166 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 117 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure of 137 mmHg. The dog was alert, responsive and extremely agitated. It had bilaterally dilated pupils and displayed rotational locomoter activity (repeatedly circling in an anticlockwise direction) (Additional file\n: Movie 1).\nBlood samples were collected by cephalic venipuncture and placed in different sets of tubes, with or without anticoagulant, for a complete blood count (CBC), a biochemical profile panel and coagulation tests. All these tests were performed by IDEXX In-house Diagnostics Station (IDEXX Laboratories, Sacramento, CA). Hematological findings included white blood cell count 21,000/μL (reference range 5,050-16,760/μL), red blood cell count 5.1 M/μL (reference range 5.65-8.87 M/μL), red blood cell specific volume 31.2% (reference range 37.3%-61.7%), platelets 55,000/μL (reference range 148,000-484,000/μL), lymphocytes 5,300/μL (reference range 1,050-5,100/μL), and neutrophils 15,000 (reference range 2,950-11,640/μL) with normal segmented neutrophils. The results of the biochemical panel revealed mildly elevated alanine aminotranferease (ALT; 112 U/L, reference range is 10-100 U/L) and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALKP; 238 U/L, reference range is 23-212U/L) concentrations, with mildly decreased glucose (70 mg/dL, reference range 74-143 mg/dL). The prothrombin time (PT) was 16.8 seconds (reference range 11.0-14.0 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 125.0 seconds (reference range 60.0-93.0).\nBlood gas was also evaluated by electrolyte analysis and a blood gas analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories, Sacramento, CA) and the results revealed a pH of 7.20 (reference range 7.31-7.42) and a base deficit of 17.8 mmol/L (HCO3-, reference range 20.0-29.0 mmol/L), with unremarkable potassium, chloride and sodium concentrations. An x-ray of the chest and abdomen appeared normal with exception of severe distension of the stomach and small intestinal tract with air. Portions of the colon were also air filled. Presumptive diagnosis was functional or paralytic ileus (Figure \n). The urine test was unremarkable without any pathologic casts.At the time of presentation at the emergency unit, a preliminary drug screen on urine was performed using rapid competitive immunochromatographic screening tests (ABON Biopharm, Zhejiang, China) for the detection of ketamine, methamphetamine, methadone, or morphine. The screening tests showed positive results only for methamphetamine (Figure \nA). At the same time, the blood and urine samples were collected and submitted to Zhejiang Forensic Medical Examination Center (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China) for the confirmation and quantification of the methamphetamine present in blood using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS results were provided by the police reports. Quantitative test revealed that the methamphetamine concentrations in serum and urine were 0.32 μg/mL and 2.35 μg/mL, respectively.\nAfter the blood samples were taken, the dog was placed in a quiet room with minimum external stimulation. In order to treat the hyperthermia and maintain an adequate urine output, a venous catheter (Introcan; B. Braun Trading Corp, Shanghai, China) was placed in one cephalic vein for fluid administration, using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution. External cooling was continued using ice packs, and the rectal temperature was continually monitored to prevent possible hypothermia. The dog was given 3.6 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate to correct the base deficit over the first 12 hours. The dosage then was adjusted according to the subsequent blood gas analysis. An intermittent intravenous injection of 50% Glucose Solution was given as appropriate based on continuous monitoring of serum glucose for the regulation of mild hypoglycemia. Subcutaneous amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (7 mg/kg amoxicillin and 1.75 mg/kg clavulanate potassium as effective; Synulox Injection, Pfizer, New York) was begun on admission, and withdrawn within 4 days after the white blood cell count returned to normal and after confirming that urine cultures proved no growth of bacteria. Intravenous phenobarbital (4 mg/kg; Sodium Phenobarbital Injection, Tianjin Pharma., Tianjin, China) and acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg; Acepromazine injection, Mavlab Pty Ltd, Queensland, Australia) were given to control seizures and agitation. The dog was started on low-molecular-weight heparin to control coagulation abnormalities, supported with intravenous fluids for maintaining sufficient microvascular perfusion.\nOver the initial 24 hours of hospitalization, the dog demonstrated progressive improvement, with the high fever resolved (between 36.5 and 37.6°C), normal serum glucose concentration, and sufficient urine output. After administration of phenobarbital and acepromazine the dog was lay down in the cage and ceased its repetitive circling. Nevertheless, it still had several short seizures and displayed occasional muscle twitching. Following the repetitive administration of phenobarbital and acepromazine no more seizures, muscle twitching, or repetitive circling behaviors were observed (beyond 48 hours after hospitalization). Urine was screened again on day 3 using the same rapid assay and at that time failed to reveal the presence of methamphetamine. By the sixth day of hospitalization the dog was clinically well (no diarrhea, no petechiae, no pupillary dilation, and eating and drinking well) and all laboratory data had returned to normal with the exception of a mildly elevated ALKP (220 U/L, reference range 23-212 U/L). The dog was sent to local veterinary hospital with no further medications. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Her past medical history was significant for a well-controlled HIV infection of 6 years on highly active anti-retroviral therapy, hypertension, ESRD secondary to HIV-associated nephropathy, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. She was a non-smoker and had no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Her initial renal biopsy revealed collapsing focal glomerular sclerosis, microcystic dilation of renal tubules, lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates, and interstitial fibrosis. She received chronic cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 5 years and was well controlled clinically regarding uremic and volume status with no abnormalities regarding color, viscosity, or volume of exchanges. Subsequently, she was transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) due to personal preferences. A few weeks after the transition to intermittent HD, ascites of unclear etiology developed, ultimately requiring repeated large-volume paracentesis with ~ 5 – 7 L ascitic fluid removals every other week.\nThere were no associated symptoms of coughing, palpitations, or shortness of breath. She was chronically anuric. Vital signs showed blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 74 beats/min (regular), respiratory rate 16/min and temperature 36.9 °C. Oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient room air. Her physical examination was remarkable for moderate ascites and edema of the lower extremities. Otherwise neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular examinations were normal without organomegaly and without clinical stigmata or symptoms of chronic liver disease or heart failure.\nLaboratory investigations showed normocytic, normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL and uncorrected serum calcium of 8.6 mg/dL. Other labs were as follows: CD4 T-cell count: 600/mm3, HIV viral load: 986 copies/mL (reference: < 40 copies/mL), serum creatinine: 10.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase: 13 U/L (normal range: 5 – 34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase: 17 U/L (5 – 45 U/L), bilirubin: 0.4 mg/dL, prothrombin time INR: 1.01, serum albumin: 2.3 mg/dL, serum amylase: 105 IU/L (27 – 130 U/L), serum lipase: 40 IU/L (8 – 78 U/L). Her tumor antigens (Ag) were within reference range for cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and CA19-9. CA 125 levels were repeatedly elevated (197 – 416 U/mL (normal: < 34.9 U/mL)), but no further follow-up was obtained. Analysis of the ascites fluid showed an albumin level of 1.5 g/dL and protein of 3.5 g/dL. The serum-to-ascites albumin gradient was < 1.1 excluding portal hypertension as a cause of ascites. The culture of peritoneal fluid was negative for acid-fast bacilli. There were no fungi seen by calcofluor white stain. Histoplasma Ag and Aspergillus Ag were negative. The pancreas was reported normal on computed tomography. Her β-2 microglobulin was elevated to 47.30 mg/L (normal: 0.80 – 2.3). Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminemia and decreased total protein, with minimal monoclonal M-component only (IgG-κ 0.30 g/dL in the γ zone). Immunofixation electrophoresis showed polyclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) with polyclonal light chains. κ and λ light chains were increased to 66.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.33 – 1.94) and 18.55 mg/dL (normal: 0.57 – 2.63), respectively, yielding a ratio of 3.6 (normal: 0.26 – 1.65) (). Ascitic fluid analysis showed a marked increase in plasma cells with an abnormal κ : λ ratio, i.e., > 5 : 1.\nLiver biopsy was essentially normal, hence an omental biopsy was performed which on immunohistochemistry showed similar findings as the ascitic fluid with predominant κ and faint λ staining (). Multiple myeloma work-ups with skeletal surveys revealed no focal osseous lesions, apart from the osseous changes of hyperparathyroidism. Accordingly, the diagnosis of omental EMP with malignant ascites was established. Omental resection and radiation were offered to the patient, but she refused further intervention. Two years of follow-up, she remained stable without any further complication, apart from requiring regular paracenteses. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Enhanced CT showed a tumor in the upper part of the right ureter, with a density similar to the ureteral wall, which appeared to be the cause of hydronephrosis and no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Fig. A, B). Distal metastasis was not observed. A well-defined 20-mm (diameter) defect was identified at the upper right ureter on retrograde pyelogram (RP) (Fig. C), with no bladder cancer on cystoscopy; therefore, the findings of urinary cytology and right divided renal urine cytology were classified as class I.\nBased on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with contracted kidney with right ureteral cancer (cT2, N0, M0) and right hydronephrosis, and the condition was close to that of a nonfunctional kidney; laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed.\nThe extracted specimen was a nonpapillary, broad-based, solid tumor measuring 20 × 13 mm with a yellowish-white cut surface (Fig. A).\nHistopathological findings showed an increase in spindle cells with an interlacing fascicular pattern, mild nuclear atypia, and no mitotic figures (Fig. B).

    "problem": "<Context> A male infant was born at 40 3/7 weeks of gestation to a G2P1, 29-year-old mother. The mother had been treated for epilepsy with oxcarbazepine for 14 months, with a total daily oral dose of 300 mg (150 mg twice/day); her seizures were well controlled during her pregnancy. Her pregnancy was complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus, and she controlled her blood glucose level through diet and exercise. A history of additional medications, drug abuse, smoking, or alcohol consumption was denied during the pregnancy. The infant was born via cesarean section because of active-phase labor arrest. His birth weight was 3320 g, and his length was 49 cm. On delivery, the Apgar scores were 9 at 1 minute and 10 at both 5 and 10 minutes, indicating good health.\nApproximately 12 hours after birth, the infant began to experience paroxysmal jitter, which presented as increased muscle tone, shaking of the lower limbs, and gripping of the hands, with 1–2 seconds of recovery. These symptoms occurred frequently, almost once every few minutes, without perioral cyanosis or fever symptoms. His blood glucose level was 48.6 mg/dl (2.7 mmol/L) at 1 hour, 63 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/L) at 2 hours, 81 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/L) at 3 hours, 68.4 (3.8 mmol/L) at both 6 and 12 hours, and 75.6 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/L) at 24 hours. Routine blood examination was performed before admission and showed a white blood cell count of 25.55 × 103/mm3, hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dl (180 g/L), and a platelet count of 227 × 103/mm3. The percentage of lymphocytes was 23.44%, and the C-reactive protein level was 5 mg/L. Cefaclor 62.5 mg twice/day was prophylactically administered for a total of five doses. Cranial ultrasound showed no abnormal features. To confirm the diagnosis and provide further treatment, the infant was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in our hospital 2 days after birth.\nThe infant's body temperature on admission was 36.5°C, pulse was 166 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 47 breaths/minute, and blood pressure was 60/34 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed a relatively high muscle tone. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.53, carbon dioxide partial pressure of 20 mm Hg, oxygen partial pressure of 66 mm Hg, base excess level of –6.0 mEq/L, and a bicarbonate level of 16.7 mEq/L. Routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels were normal. Cardiac enzyme, blood ammonia, lactic acid, and β-hydroxybutyric acid levels were slightly higher on admission. The jitter of the limbs may have been related to perinatal factors (e.g., hypoxia/asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage), an internal environment disorder (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia), intracranial infections, the infant's own factors (e.g., structural or developmental abnormalities of the nervous system, metabolic diseases, epilepsy-related gene mutation), or oxcarbazepine-induced drug withdrawal. The infant did not have any evidence of hypoxia/asphyxia or intracranial hemorrhage in his medical history. In addition, cranial ultrasound results did not support perinatal factors. When considering the infant's normal electrolyte and complete blood count on admission, coupled with no evidence of infection and a physical examination that revealed no neck resistance or nervous system signs, an internal environment disorder and intracranial infection factors were excluded. To exclude the infant's own factors, imaging examinations and metabolic screening were completed. Because the mother had a history of epilepsy, epilepsy-related genes could be detected if necessary. On postnatal day 7, the infant's metabolic screening and head magnetic resonance imaging results revealed no obvious abnormality.\nAfter admission, the infant presented with increased excitability, irritability, limb shaking, and increased muscle tone, which became obvious when the infant was hungry and improved after feeding. Concerned that the infant was exposed to oxcarbazepine in utero, the pediatric pharmacist reviewed the literature and suggested that NAS could not be excluded. Therefore, the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Severity Score was determined to evaluate the infant's withdrawal symptoms and whether pharmacologic intervention was needed. The Finnegan score increased from 4 on postnatal day 4 to 9 on postnatal day 6, indicating NAS. A recommendation was made to monitor the oxcarbazepine plasma concentrations of both the mother and the infant. The oxcarbazepine steady-state peak plasma concentration of the mother was 18.5 mg/L (therapeutic range 3–35 mg/L), and the trough concentration was 16.7 mg/L, whereas the concentration in the infant on postnatal day 6 was 2.6 mg/L. Because three consecutive Finnegan scores averaging 8 or greater, or two scores averaging 12 or greater, did not occur and because the oxcarbazepine concentration of the infant was relatively low, oxcarbazepine was directly discontinued rather than gradually withdrawn from the infant, and no treatment other than supportive care was needed. In terms of feeding, the oxcarbazepine steady-state peak milk concentration of the mother was 7.8 mg/L, consistent with the 0.5 milk : plasma concentration ratio reported in the literature.\nHLA-B*1502 genotype testing of the infant was performed by a pharmacist to evaluate the risk of carbamazepine-related toxic effects, which revealed that the infant was HLA-B*1502 negative. Breastfeeding was not contraindicated for this infant. After weighing the pros and cons, the mother made a final decision to continue breastfeeding.\nOn postnatal day 7, a decrease in limb shaking movements was observed, although there was no improvement in the increased muscle tone. By day 10 of life, the infant's jitter frequency decreased to one time and was relieved within 2 seconds, thus revealing a significant improvement. The infant was then discharged from the NICU. The parents were told that the in utero oxcarbazepine exposure might lead to a risk of teratogenicity; however, the chance was relatively small. Owing to the mother's relatively low dose of oxcarbazepine, there seemed to be no abnormalities in appearance and in the vital organs of the infant. To evaluate whether oxcarbazepine had an impact on the infant's nervous system and organ development, long-term follow-up was needed. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

X-ray of chest revealed bilateral reticulonodular opacities, upper lobar zone venous prominence, bilateral pleural effusion, and no cardiomegaly []. Her electrocardiogram was normal. Echocardiography revealed normal-sized chambers, valves, right and left atrial pressures, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Cultures of blood, urine, and tracheal aspirate were sterile. Intravenous inotropes were continued (dopamine: 10-15 μg/kg/min; noradrenaline: 10-12 μg/kg/min), systolic BP increased to 90-110 mmHg when iv frusemide was added. Two boluses of calcium gluconate were given (10 ml of 10% solution) 15 minutes apart, thereafter, low-dose infusion (at the rate 1 mg/kg of calcium) was started; ionized serum calcium level was maintained between 4.8-5.3 mg/dl. Thoracentesis was performed, 300 ml of exudative effusion (total count: 2800/cmm, leukocytes: 2400/cmm; predominantly lymphocytes; lactate dehydrogenase – 698 U/L; protein – 3 g/dL) was drained from either side. She was ventilated initially invasively, later non-invasively; and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Gram-positive, Gram-negative organisms and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were started in view of prior hospitalization. Monitored parameters included clinical status, central venous pressure, urine output, fluid, and electrolytes including calcium levels and ECG every 4-6 hrs for first 48, thereafter every 12 hours. Her urine output improved after 24 hours. She was successfully weaned off ventilator after 48 hours; inotropes (noradrenaline after 18 hours, dopamine after 48 hours) and calcium infusion (after 48 hours) were gradually tapered off.

    "problem": "<Context> A 70-year-old female patient presented to us in the early morning of January 1, 2011 with massive haemoptysis. The patient was a known case of hypothyroidism and hypertension and on regular treatment. She had been complaining of cough with expectoration and mild streaking of blood in sputum for about 3 days. On examination the pulse rate was 96/min, BP 134/76 mm Hg, RR 25/min, and SPO2 94% on 2 l of O2. Chest examination revealed bilateral vesicular breath sounds with crepts in right infrascapular and infra-axillary regions. There was no history of dental manipulation, facial lesions or trauma to mouth, aspiration, or alcoholism. Her cardiovascular, GIT, and central nervous system examinations revealed no abnormality. She was admitted in the intensive care unit and her initial investigations including ECG, ABG, CBC, KFT, LFT, and RBS were within the normal range. Her sputum was sent for AFB, gram's stain, and fungal stain along with culture and sensitivity for pyogenic organisms. Her chest X-ray revealed right mid zone homogenous opacity along with the obliteration of both right costophrenic and cardiophrenic angles []. She was started on piperacillin + tazobactum along with IV haemostatics, IV fluids, and cough suppressants. Once stabilized, she was taken for diagnostic fibreoptic bronchoscopy that revealed a cauliflower-like growth in RUL bronchus [] raising a high suspicion of malignancy. BAL was taken and bronchial biopsy for histopathology was obtained from the lesion and sent for histopathological examination. She was continued on conservative treatment and the haemoptysis stopped. BAL was negative for AFB; no organisms were seen on gram's stain and fungal stain. Pyogenic culture also did not grow any organisms. Her chest X-ray after the antibiotics showed an increase in the size of the homogenous opacity abutting the heart []. CECT thorax revealed a large heterogenous soft tissue mass measuring 7 × 5.9 × 6 cm with surrounding parenchymal infiltrates in anterior segment of upper-right lobe and medial segment of middle-right lobe. The mass was abutting the anterior segmental bronchus of upper-right lobe, medial segmental bronchus of the middle-right lobe, costal and mediastinal pleura; the patchy area of consolidation was seen in lower-right lobe limited by oblique fissure with bilateral pleural effusions, which were more on the right side []. Diagnostic pleural aspiration was done. Pleural fluid did not show any organisms on gram stain, AFB stain, and fungal stain. Pyogenic culture was sterile and malignant cells were not seen. The ADA level was 4.76 IU, thus almost ruling out TB. Bronchial biopsy showed markedly inflamed bronchial mucosa with granulation tissue and sheets of inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils. Bronchial biopsy was also sent for culture where occasional colonies of gram positive filamentous bacteria surrounded by neutrophils were seen. CT-guided FNAC and Trucut biopsy were done for better understanding of the lesion. On performing FNAC thick pus was aspirated out. FNAC showed sheets of neutrophils and occasional branches of filamentous bacteria with impression of suppurative pathology. Trucut biopsy showed sheets of neutrophils with colonies of filamentous bacteria and sulphur granules [] consistent with actinomycotic infection. She was started on Benzyl penicillin 20 lac units IV 6 hourly and had a dramatic response. Her symptoms disappeared and chest X-ray almost cleared []. Finally, she was discharged in a stable condition on oral amoxicillin + clavulanic acid combination. She is under regular follow up and has continued to be in a stable condition for more than a year. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

Because the age is between 65 and 74, one point added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.

    "problem": "<Context> A three-month-old full term male was brought to the pediatric ED by his grandmother for evaluation of “jerking” activity worsening in frequency and severity for approximately three weeks. The grandmother described the “jerking” activity as intermittent upper body stiffening with associated eye blinking and drooling with a change in level of alertness just following the event. She reported that the episodes had increased in frequency over the few days prior to ED arrival but claimed the episodes had been present for the approximately one month. The grandmother stated that initially the jerking occurred approximately once per day; however, there were three episodes noted on the day of presentation. She described these episodes as lasting seconds to minutes and were not associated with color change, respiratory distress, or spitting up. They occurred at any time of the day, with no predilection for early morning or sleep arousal, and there was no association with feeding. She denied any recent history of falls, head trauma, fever, cough, congestion, diarrhea or rash. The remainder of the review of systems was negative. The infant was formula-fed every four hours and had been producing a normal amount of wet diapers and stool. When questioned about the pregnancy, the grandmother was unsure if the mother had been using drugs or alcohol, but stated that the infant was the product of an uncomplicated labor and delivery with a normal newborn screening. His birth weight was reported as 2.86 kg. The infant attended daycare, but there were no known sick contacts. The grandmother stated that the baby had been healthy, meeting his development milestones, and gaining weight appropriately according to his last well-child visit. There was a maternal history of multiple sclerosis reported by the grandmother.\nOn physical exam, the infant appeared well and was noted to make eye contact with the grandmother. Initial weight and vital signs reported at triage were as follows: weight: 5.51 kg, temperature 98.0° F, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, heart rate 143 beats/min, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The pertinent positives of his exam included a full anterior fontanelle but no bulging. Extraocular movements were equal with no nystagmus appreciated. There was a mild left ocular prominence noted but no proptosis. He had no facial deformity or external signs of trauma with tears present and moist mucous membranes. His neck was supple, and appropriate head control was appreciated when he was seated in his grandmother’s lap. An overall slight increase in his tone was noted. All movements were observed to be symmetrical with no obvious motor deficit or weakness.\nMoments after the initial assessment, the ED staff was called to the bedside by the grandmother. The infant was observed to have left eye blinking followed by asynchronous right eye blinking with drooling at the mouth. He was unresponsive to direct confrontation. No other jerking motions were observed. The episode lasted less than two minutes during which time he was placed on a cardiac monitor and vital signs were stable. Immediately following the episode, the infant was not responding normally to the grandmother but became increasingly more alert and returned back to baseline within several minutes.\nGiven his initial presentation and witnessed seizure activity, laboratory tests and imaging were ordered. The results of his lab work were as follows: WBC 10.4 × 103, Hgb 12.4 g/dL, Hct 36.3%, platelets 302 × 103/mm; Differential: lymphocytes 77%, neutrophils 14%, eosinophils 9%. Sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 5.5 mEq/L, chloride 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate 20 mEq/L, BUN 5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.22 mg/dL, glucose 100 mg/dL, magnesium 2.1 mEq/L, phosphorus 5.5 mg/dL, anion gap 10.\nIn an attempt to spare exposure to ionizing radiation, the decision was made to perform a stat non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. After review of the scout images from MRI, a magnetic resonance angiogram protocol was added. Imaging revealed a large supratentorial cystic and solid mass in the left temporal region measuring 8.6cm × 7.9cm × 5.1cm. A plan was then made to transfer the patient to a pediatric intensive care unit, which could afford a higher level of care. A loading dose of levetiracetam (55 mg) intravenously was administered and D10 NS was run at maintenance.\nThe infant had five seizures on the day of admission, two of them witnessed. He was given an additional dose of levetiracetam 20 mg/kg IV and then continued on a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg. The patient was also started on a dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg. No subsequent seizure activity was reported following medication titration. Operative management was conducted by pediatric neurosurgery on hospital day 6. The patient underwent a left craniotomy with gross tumor resection. Pathology report indicated the tumor was consistent with DIG. In the post-operative period, the patient was observed to have a left lateral gaze palsy, and repeat imaging revealed a new acute infarct of the right thalamus. Due to the acute infarct, a neurology consult was obtained and the infant underwent a full work-up for a new-onset hypercoaguable state. The infant was found to have a slightly elevated anti-thrombin III level, and the infarct was not attributed to surgical management. Echocardiography was found to be normal and the patient was subsequently started on aspirin. The infant’s subgaleal Jackson-Pratt drain remained in place until post-operative day 3. No respiratory or gastrointestinal complications arose and the patient was tolerating full feeds within several days post-operatively.\nDespite the right thalamic infarct, the patient had an excellent post-operative course in the months following discharge. At his last well-child visit, no neurological deficits were appreciated and the infant was meeting expected milestones for his age. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-0.0992",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.0898",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 3 months old. This means the patient is 0 years old. The patient's is a Male. The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6. The patient's weight is 5.51 kg. The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 5.51 * (136.0/140 - 1) = -0.0945 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.0945 L.",

At the outpatient clinic, neither lip cyanosis nor oxygen desaturation was discernible. At admission, she was 54 kg in weight and 168 cm in height. Pulse rate was 82/min, and respiratory rate 20/min. Hemoglobin was 14.9 gm/L. Clubbing fingers were remarkable (). Peripheral pulse oximeter showed marked fluctuations of oxygen saturations (SpO2), ranging from 84% to 95% in the supine position and from 80% to 88% in the upright position. There was no pathological heart murmur. Liver and blood coagulation functions were normal. Initial trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bubble study in the supine position failed to detect any intracardiac shunt. However, TTE with bubble study performed in the seated position did reveal an interatrial right-to-left shunt (). Hemodynamic data are summarized in . There was a step-down of oxygen saturation from the pulmonary vein to the left atrium, indicating an interatrial right-to-left shunt. Besides, there was no trans-atrial pressure gradient, right ventricular hypertension, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) with Doppler showed a secundum ASD with a right-to-left shunt. Balloon sizing showed an indentation of 21.84 mm in diameter (). Before implantation, a bolus of 2000 units of heparin was infused into the delivery system. A 22-mm ASO was chosen to occlude this defect (). After implantation, ICE showed complete occlusion (). We wiggled the cable to test the stability and relieved the device smoothly.

After establishing intravenous access with a 22-guage cannula in a vein in the cubital fossa of his left arm, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (140mg) and fentanyl (50ug). A size 3 classic laryngeal mask was inserted for airway management, and spontaneous ventilation was maintained with 1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane in a 50% oxygen to air mixture. Five millilitres of a local anaesthesia solution (lignocaine 2% with 1:200,000 adrenalin) was injected into the surgical area for local anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. During surgery both of his arms were positioned by his side in a neutral position, supported by foam padding on the operating table to minimise pressure.

Viral markers, including Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus, were negative; HAV was positive. Urinalysis showed dark-colored urine with 2+ bilirubin, a trace of blood, and 1+ proteinuria. A 24-hr urine test revealed albuminuria (197.2 mg). The daily urine output was maintained at 1,500-2,000 mL with furosemide. A chest roentgenogram initially showed pulmonary congestion with a bilateral pleural effusion that was improved by furosemide. Abdominal ultrasonography showed normal sized kidneys with increased echogenecity and splenomegaly. On the 3rd hospital day, a kidney biopsy was performed and showed a diffusely edematous interstitium with infiltration of inflammatory cells and severely damaged tubules, findings which were compatible with ATIN. An immunohistochemical study identified the infiltrating cells as predominantly CD3+ T cells and CD68+ activated macrophages (). The glomeruli were relatively well-preserved. On the 8th hospital day, consolidation in both upper lobes developed. All microbiological culture studies were negative and no endobronchial lesions were detected. Despite catheter exchange and empirical antibiotics, a high fever, consolidation, and rash persisted. With hemodialysis and supportive care, liver and kidney dysfunction gradually improved, while anemia worsened and leucopenia and thrombocytopenia developed; the hemoglobin was 7.4 g/dL (hematocrit, 22.2%), the absolute neutrophil count was 130/µL, and the platelet count was 141,000/µL. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a normocellular marrow with occasional hemophagocytosis (); there was no evidence of malignancy. The ferritin level was 2678 (17-390) ng/mL, the triglycerides were 493 (55-327) mg/dL, and the fibrinogen was 557 (225-457) mg/dL. VAHS was highly suspected and steroids were added to the treatment regimen. Upon steroid treatment, the fever, rash, and bilateral consolidation rapidly subsided. Hemodialysis was stopped after 13 dialysis sessions and renal function remained stable with a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. He was discharged on a steroid taper in the outpatient clinic. The creatinine level declined to 1.3 mg/dL about 1 month later. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "4",
    "Upper Limit": "4",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.1 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 108.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 14700.0 count/µL. To convert 14700.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 14700.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 14700000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 3 + 1 = 4 criteria met. Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 4.",

There was no history of trauma, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, dysuria, hematuria or melena. His past medical history included hypertension, atrial flutter and cardiomyopathy, and he had an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD). There was no prior history of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the patient or in his family. His past surgical history included an inguinal hernia repair. His medications included aspirin, valsartan, metoprolol and atorvastatin. He did not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.\nPhysical exam showed vitals signs as follows: body temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 140/82 mmHg, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and pulsoximetry of 98% on room air. He was alert, but appeared in mild distress due to pain. His abdominal exam revealed tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound, guarding, distention or organomegaly. The remainder of the exam was normal.\nThe initial emergency department evaluation included an electrocardiogram that showed atrial flutter with a 4:1 block. Laboratory assessment revealed trace hematuria, no leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal range, 0.7–1.4 mg/dL), mildly elevated lipase to 85 U/L (normal range, 12–70 U/L), mild hyperglycemia and mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase to 46 U/L (normal range, 7–40 U/L). The lactate and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase was not ordered at presentation, but obtained 2 days after admission, and was elevated at 1,479 U/L (normal range, 100–220 U/L). Lactate dehydrogenase is present in the renal tissue and elevates in serum after kidney insult, and it is unknown whether this level correlates to the severity of the infarct.\nGiven the nature of the pain and the hematuria seen on urinalysis and the history of cardiomyopathy with atrial flutter, both nephrolithiasis and mesenteric ischemia were strongly considered as causes for this acute pain. Therefore, both non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography (CT) images [Figures and ] were obtained, which showed extensive infarction involving the upper pole of the right kidney with multiple patchy infarcts into the lower pole, a patent right renal artery, but no visualization of the interparenchymal arterial branches within the mid and upper poles of the right kidney, suggesting arterial thromboembolic disease. There was poor opacification of the right renal vein, and, therefore, renal vein thrombus could not be ruled out. A 2-mm left renal calculus was also identified.\nThe urology and vascular surgery services were consulted, and both recommended conservative treatment with anticoagulation. In addition to normal saline and dilaudid for pain control, a heparin bolus of 80 mg/kg was given and an infusion at 18 mg/kg/h was initiated, with the patient being admitted to the general medicine service.\nIt was concluded his renal artery thrombosis was most likely embolic and a 2-D echocardiogram was ordered, which showed no intramural thrombus. He was discharged 5 days later, on coumadin. His creatinine, which was 1.3 mg/dL on admission, rose to 1.8 mg/dL and fell to 1.7 mg/dL by discharge.

The infant's Apgar score was 7 and 8 at birth and 5 min after birth, respectively. Concerning the preterm birth and respiratory distress, the infant was transferred to the NICU and placed in an incubator at an appropriate temperature. On the first day after birth, the infant underwent a chest radiograph, the results of which showed no health problem (). After sterile pre-procedural prepping and draping, a trained nurse first inserted the PICC into the basilic vein using a special angiocatheter and directed it into the vein using an angiocatheter guide (). Then the catheter (the Arrowg+ard Blue Advance™ PICC made in United States country), was pushed from the catheter insertion site to the middle of the clavicle bone and then to the mid-sternal region. Finally, the catheter was fixed with an IV fixing bandage (sterile disposable cannula catheter fixing IV Non-woven dressing made in China). After the PICC placement, the infant underwent an anterior-posterior chest X-ray again and a neonatologist confirmed the correct placement of the PICC tip in the SVC.

Consequently, he received both parenteral and enteral nutrition with a total energy of 1200 kcal/day and 25.0 g/day protein. Physical findings and serum levels related to renal function are shown in Table . When his body composition was analyzed using the InBody® (Inbody S20; Biospace, Seoul, Korea) system, the skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), fat mass, body fat, and extracellular water (ECW) to total body water (TBW) ratio were 14.2 kg, 5.85 kg/m2, 19.4 kg, 39.0%, and 0.436, respectively. The patient had edema, ascites, and a pleural effusion. His dry weight estimated by subtracting the excess fluid from the actual body weight was 47.0 kg; the patient lost 10.0 kg in about 5 months. He met the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [] and was classified as severely malnourished. He underwent repeated cycles of constipation and diarrhea.\nThe target energy intake was set at 35.0 kcal/kg/day (1700 kcal/day). The target protein intake was 1.20 g/kg/day (60.0 g/day) and 0.80 g/kg/day (40.0 g/day) when on and off dialysis, respectively, based on the consensus among the NST, the nephrologist, and the gastrointestinal surgeon, and consistent with the 2016 Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury in Japan [] and recommendation of the third revision (2013) of the guidelines for parenteral and enteral nutrition in Japan []. The use of intravenous- and enteral-nutrition routes was evaluated continuously. The patient was assessed as having AKI which gradually improved but transitioned from acute to chronic kidney disease. The nephrologist assessed the need for weekly hemodialysis, which the patient received as needed. Priority was given to patient mobilization, balance of energy intake and expenditure, prevention of complications associated with bed rest, and prevention of the progression of generalized deconditioning.\nThe patient was fed via a combination of total parenteral nutrition, peripheral parenteral nutrition, and enteral nutrition; blood-glucose levels were monitored. We evaluated the patient’s physical findings, renal function test values (Table ) and adjusted laxative prescriptions to improve bowel movements. Dialysis was stopped on day 56. On day 112 of the NST intervention, the protein dose was 1.40 g/kg/day, and the energy and protein doses were stabilized. The intake of essential nutrients was sufficient with continuous enteral nutrition alone at a slow rate throughout the day (Table ).\nThe patient’s limbs were strong enough to perform activities of daily living (ADL) in bed, so upper body muscle training was started 5 days a week for 20 min. The aim of this training was to extend the sitting time on the bed and to acquire ADL-movement ability. Moreover, lower-limb muscle training was initiated to prevent the loss of skeletal muscle. As the patient’s nutritional status improved, the proportion of strength training in the regimen was gradually increased. The patient was able to stand unassisted on day 100 of the intervention; hence, walking training was started.\nRenalen®MP was administered via an enteral route as an energy-dense nutrition formula to meet the target energy goals. Furthermore, we added branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)-enriched nutritional supplements (i.e., ENEVO® and Aminoleban®EN) because they are expected to promote protein synthesis []. Initially, Renalen®MP was administered during the daytime, and the patient frequently complained of gastroesophageal reflux and bloating during tube feeding, probably because of the high fat content in Renalen®MP. Because of these complaints, it was difficult for him to continue rehabilitation. Therefore, we changed the time of administration of Renalen®MP from daytime to nighttime (Table ). The patient was able to walk independently on day 150. He could also ingest a small amount of food orally. On day 200, the skeletal-muscle mass, SMI, fat mass, body fat, and ECW/TBW ratio were 19.1 kg, 7.95 kg/m2, 17.6 kg, 31.4%, and 0.436, respectively. The ECOG PS was 2. The rehabilitation was continued, so that the patient could be discharged.\nThe patient was able to receive daily nutrition both enterally and orally. The dynamic nutritional-assessment parameters and brachial muscle analysis increased over time (Figs. , ). Body weight and LBM slightly decreased by day 103 but increased after day 103. On day 200, they have improved to what it was almost before the surgery (Fig. ). He continued rehabilitation because his bowel movements were controlled. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Symptoms were not alleviated or exacerbated by any specific factors. The patient had purchased a Cerbera odollam plant on the internet a week prior. She ingested one seed of this plant, as this was suggested to be the lethal dose, with the intent of ending her life. The exact time between ingestion and presentation was unknown. On transportation to the hospital, the patient had a documented heart rate in the 30s with a junctional rhythm and therefore received a total of 10 vials of Digibind (digoxin immune fab). She denied any headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, or constipation.\nOn presentation, the patient's vital signs were blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, body temperature at 98.6 degrees F, and oxygen level of 98% on room air. Physical examination was noted as within normal limits. Labs performed included urine toxicology which was positive for cannabis, digoxin level 0.2 ng/mL, salicylate level less than 1.7 mg/dL, acetaminophen level less than 2 mcg/mL, blood alcohol content of 0, lactic acid 1.2 mmol/L, white blood cell count 8,100/μL, hemoglobin 13.9 g/dL, hematocrit 40.8%, platelets 165/μL, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 29 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, creatinine 0.84 mg/dL, glucose 107 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, AST 37 U/L, ALT 61 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 48 U/L.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) was performed shortly after arrival. This demonstrated a significant decrease in heart rate as compared to presenting vital signs. The heart rate had decreased from 106 beats per minute to 36 beats per minute (). Therefore, the patient was monitored on telemetry, and repeat ECGs were ordered. Her heart rate remained in the 30s to 40s, and the rhythm was sinus bradycardia. Upon consultation, the toxicology team recommended to monitor electrolytes and heart rate closely while continuing intravenous fluids. If there were any conduction blocks or further slowing of heart rate, 5 more vials of Digibind could be given. She had a hypoglycemic episode with blood glucose of 60 mg/dL. She was administered dextrose and responded appropriately.\nThe following day, the psychiatry team was consulted, and the patient was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and depressive disorder and noted to have narcissistic and borderline personality traits. The patient met the criteria for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization once medically cleared.\nThe toxicology team continued to follow the patient during her hospitalization. Being that her digoxin level was only 0.2 ng/mL and she had normalized potassium levels, her likelihood for toxicity was low. Given her lab work and improving heart rate on ECGs (Figures and ), the team was reassured that the patient's clinical status was improving.

He felt unwell after taking atorvastatin and on evaluation had normal renal function (blood urea: 38 mg/dl, serum creatinine [SCr]: 1.1 mg/dl). Since he continued to feel tired, he had a review 3 weeks later and was detected to have azotemia (blood urea: 54 mg/dl, SCr: 1.9 mg/dl) and was referred to our unit. He complained of tiredness, but did not have fever, skin rash, muscle weakness or tenderness. Blood pressure was 105/80 mm Hg and pulse rate was 75/min. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Urine examination showed no albuminuria and no sediment on microscopy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was normal (70 U/L). He denied taking any other drug, including indigenous or over the counter medications, other than atorvastatin and multivitamin capsule. He was thought to have AKI due to atorvastatin and it was discontinued. After 1 week SCr rose to 2.4 mg/dl and he underwent renal biopsy, which showed nine glomeruli, of which one showed periglomerular fibrosis. Moderate interstitial round cell infiltrates [] were seen along with few eosinophils. Mild hyaline arteriosclerosis was seen. Immunoflurescence study showed minimal mesangial deposits of immunoglobulin M and was negative for other immunoglobulins and C3. The renal biopsy was consistent with acute interstitial nephritis.\nHe was started on oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks and then slowly tapered the dose over 2 months and stopped.

He was advised not to take statins in the future.\nHe was admitted 6 months after the initial presentation with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting. He was given atorvastatin 40 mg post PTCA, but was replaced with rosuvastatin 10 mg after 2 days in view of previous allergic interstitial nephritis attributed to atorvastatin.

    "problem": "<Context> A 62-year-old male patient with a history of kidney failure secondary to amyloidosis\npresented with chills, rigors, epigastric tenderness, and diarrhea. A tiny granuloma with\nscanty discharge at the exit site and a turbid peritoneal dialysate were observed the day\nbefore admission.\nHe was anuric and had been on PD for 13 years, with a CAPD dialysis regimen as follows:\n2.5% 2.5 L glucose dialysate with three exchanges in the daytime, plus an additional\nexchange with 7.5% 2 L icodextrin dialysate overnight. He performed CAPD bag exchanges\nhimself and was known to have a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency\nand hypertension. His CAPD regimen showed 600 mL/day of ultrafiltration, which was mainly\nattributable to icodextrin use. The International Society for PD released guidelines in\n2000 regarding ultrafiltration failure (UF failure), which defined UF failure using the\n3 × 4 rule (), which declares that ultrafiltration failure exists if net ultrafiltration\nis <400 mL following drainage of a 4% (3.86% or 4.25%, dependent on pharmacopeia)\ndialysis solution that has stayed intraperitoneally for 4 h. Thus, in this instance,\nultrafiltration failure has not occurred.\nA review of his home records indicated blood pressure readings ranging from 100/70 to\n140/90 mmHg. Daily net ultrafiltration ranged from −400 to −900 mL, while the daily fluid\nintake was ∼500 mL.\nUpon admission, he had a fever of 38.5 °C and elevated blood pressure (150/83 mmHg). His\nheart rate was 78 bpm. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95% in ambient air. His\nbody weight (without PD) was 57.8 kg, and his body mass index was 19.3 kg/m2.\nNo edema was noted. He had reduced appetite but good compliance with drug and fluid\nintake. On physical examination, there was guarding and abdominal rigidity, but bowel\nsounds were present. He had good knowledge of peritonitis, including probable entry\nroutes, symptoms, and interventions for a suspected occurrence. Thus far, the overall\nclinical manifestations of this patient receiving PD (e.g., the new onset of abdominal\npain as evidenced by the presence of abdominal guarding, fever, and appearance of cloudy\neffluent) strongly suggested the presence of CAPD-associated peritonitis ().\nLaboratory testing data are shown in . Hematologic investigations revealed\nanemia (hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL; hematocrit 31.5%), while a blood chemistry panel showed\nhyponatremia (132 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (2.09 mmol/L), hypokalemia (3.2 mmol/L),\nhypoalbuminemia (30 g/L), and significantly elevated creatinine (1,089 µmol/L), with an\nestimated glomerular filtration rate of 4.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, signifying stage-5\nchronic kidney disease.\nThe PD adequacy, as reflected by Kt/Vurea, was 1.78 weekly, which indicated\nborderline adequacy. Dialysis adequacy is a broad concept and includes fluid balance,\nsmall solute clearance, removal of uremic toxins of medium or large molecular weight, and\nmaintenance of nutritional status. Kt/Vurea is a consistent predictor of\nsurvival in PD patients () and is, therefore, an important\nmonitoring parameter. The total (peritoneal and kidney) small-solute clearance should be a\ntotal Kt/Vurea of ≥1.7 per week (). The peritoneal equilibration\ntest (PET) classified the patient as an average transporter (4 h dialysate to plasma ratio\nof creatinine [D/P creatinine], 0.791; 4 to 0 h dialysate glucose ratio [D/D0 glucose],\n0.334). PET is used to characterize the capacity for transportation of the patient’s\nperitoneal membrane (). Transport capacity assists in deciding on the dwell time and is also a\ncentral factor in determining the morbidity and mortality of PD patients (). Generally,\npatients with a high peritoneal transport status will find it beneficial to receive APD\ntreatment employing lower dwell time, whereas patients with low peritoneal transport\nstatus may find treatments with longer dwell times, e.g., CAPD, more beneficial ().\nPD effluent showed the following cell counts: white blood cell (WBC),\n3,157/mm3; polymorphonuclear neutrophilic cell (PMN), 97%; lymphocytes, 3%;\nand eosinophils, 2%. A small amount of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive\nto gentamicin, was cultured from the exit site, and the PD effluent culture revealed a\nsmall amount of Streptococcus mitis, which was sensitive to penicillin G.\nApart from these clinical elements, the provisional diagnosis of CAPD-associated\nperitonitis was confirmed by the presence of a dialysis effluent WBC count >100\ncells/mm3 (following a 120 min minimum dwell time) with PMNs >50% and\npositive effluent culture (; ).\nThe patient was able to complete the activities of daily living independently. There was\na strong bond among family members, who provided physical and emotional support to the\npatient with his daily PD care. He lived with his wife and son, both of whom were\nincredibly supportive of the patient and provided constant assistance in delivering\nhigh-quality PD care at home.\nThe patient accepted that his kidney failure was a chronic illness. He remained the\nprimary source of income for his family and was employed as an engineer at a construction\ncompany, which enabled him to be financially independent. He needed to perform one CAPD\nbag exchange at work daily. However, his work environment was not an ideal place for bag\nexchange because of the narrow space, dust, poor hygiene status, and central\nair-conditioning systems. During the patient interview, details regarding the hygiene\nstatus at work that may lead to CAPD-associated peritonitis were assessed. However, he\ncould not leave his job and admitted that he did not turn off the fan or close doors and\nwindows during CAPD bag exchanges because of the stuffy summer weather. Many researchers\nhave demonstrated that airborne bacteria concentrations are correlated with airborne\nparticulate matter (PM) concentrations () and that airborne PM can carry\nmicroorganisms (). PD catheters represent a potential channel that allows pathogens to enter\nthe peritoneal cavity from the atmosphere. When the PD catheters and dialysate bags are\nconnected and/or disconnected, or the exit site is cleaned, the risk of infection with\nairborne microorganisms increases. Thus, PD patients performing exchanges in areas with\nhigh levels of environmental PM2.5 (PM2.5 relates to airborne droplets or particles with a\ndiameter of <2.5 µm) experienced a higher rate of infection from PD within 12 months\nthan those performing exchanges in areas with low exposure to environmental PM2.5 ().\nThis case report was written retrospectively. No interventional protocol was administered\nto the patient concerned. Ethical approval from the author’s affiliated institution was\nnot required under the condition that confidentiality and anonymity of the patient were\nmaintained in the final report and analysis. The patient provided written consent for the\npublication of his data.\nThere were three prioritized health problems in the present case: peritonitis and the\nexit-site infection, imbalanced nutrition (insufficient intake of nutrients required to\nmeet the increased metabolic demands due to CAPD-associated peritonitis), and\npsychosocial concerns (workplace hygiene and inability to change jobs).\nFor immediate nursing management of the present case, the PD effluent was drained by\nthe dialysis nurse after a dwell time of ∼2 h and carefully inspected before laboratory\ntests were performed (cell counts, differential, gram stain, and cultures). Peritoneal\nlavage was then performed as prescribed by the physician, with three rapid exchanges of\nPD fluid bags to remove inflammatory cells and microorganisms from the peritoneal cavity\nand to provide symptomatic relief ().\nEmpiric antibiotic therapy for PD-associated peritonitis was started as prescribed by\nthe physician as soon as a cloudy effluent was noted (which can indicate peritonitis),\nwithout waiting for cell count and culture results from the laboratory. shows a list of\nprescribed medications administered to the patient. Intraperitoneal administration of\nantibiotics is preferred over intravenous (IV) or per os routes to reduce the chances of\ntreatment failure unless there is clinical evidence of systemic sepsis, in which case IV\nantibiotics are administered (). An effluent cell analysis with a WBC > 100/µL\n(3,157/µL in the present case) with at least 50% PMN cells (97% in the present case)\nindicated that peritonitis was the most probable cause of the cloudy effluent. The\ndialysis nurse recommended that heparin was also indicated in the present case; with\nprescription, the addition of heparin at a dose of 500 IU in every 1 L of dialysate may\nassist in preventing catheter occlusion by inhibiting fibrin formation ().\nFor the exit-site infection, the initial nursing management involved the collection of\na swab by the dialysis nurse for culture and sensitivity tests. The swab was taken at\nthe first instance of exit-site inspection on admission. An appropriate antimicrobial\ntherapy was then administered as prescribed. Antimicrobial therapy should cover both\nGram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (including Staphylococcus\naureus which tends to cause relatively poor clinical outcomes such as the\nneed for PD-catheter removal) (; ). Because this patient had a history of P.\naeruginosa infection, an antibiotic covering this microorganism was\nrecommended by the dialysis nurse. In the present case, 0.1% gentamicin cream was\nprescribed by the physician, as purulence, tenderness, and edema were absent at the exit\nsite. Once culture results were available, therapy was modified based on the specific\nsensitivity patterns. In the present case, since gentamicin cream was effective against\nP. aeruginosa, it was continued as the drug of choice as recommended\nby the dialysis nurse.\nThe frequency of exit-site care with 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate also needed to be\nincreased (). The clinical response was reviewed by the dialysis nurse after the\ninitiation of antibiotic treatment, and clinical improvement was expected during the\nfirst 72 h. Once the culture and sensitivity results were known, the antibiotic therapy\nwas appropriately adjusted by the physician, and continuous treatment was provided by\nthe dialysis nurse. In the present case, the bacterial culture of the PD effluent\nrevealed Streptococcus mitis that was sensitive to penicillin G. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "Lower Limit": "-2.08",
    "Upper Limit": "-1.88",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 62 years old. The patient's is a Male. The patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult male's the total body water percentage value is 0.60. The patient's weight is 57.8 kg. The concentration of sodium is 132.0 mmol/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 57.8 * (132.0/140 - 1) = -1.98 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -1.98 L.",

Hypothyroidism requiring thyrormone supplementation and marginal hypocalcaemia were since reported. Twenty-three years prior to the current admission, she developed hypertension and incipient renal insufficiency. The primary cause was considered to be renovascular disease, but her case was not pursued further. Her recovered follow-up data revealed that 15 years previously, she had a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, normal urinary sediment, serum calcium of 8.1 mg/dl and serum phosphate of 6.8 mg/dl, while receiving alphacalcidol at 1 mg/day.\nNine years prior to the present admission, while her serum creatinine was 1.8 mg/dl, she underwent a radionuclide study with 99mTc–Mag3 showing decreased renal perfusion and abnormal parenchymal function with reduced kidney size. Alphacalcidol was discontinued 5 years ago due to hypercalcaemia, when her serum creatinine had risen to 2 mg/dl. Her renal function gradually worsened and the patient finally reached end-stage renal failure. Renal replacement treatment with haemodialysis was initiated 9 months prior to admission. Intact parathormone (iPTH) measurements at that time were in the range 0–1 pg/ml.\nOn admission, the patient was drowsy and possessed a BP of 130/80 mmHg and temperature of 36.4°C. Physical examination revealed a mild systolic murmur at the heart apex that radiated to the neck, and a systole–diastolic murmur at the umbilical area and groin region. Neurological examination was remarkable for fixed, symmetrical pupils, normal pyramidal signs and reflexes, reduced muscle tone, a Parkinsonian tremor, impaired posture and gait. The patient was alert, but slightly disoriented with memory defects. Fundoscopy showed mild papillary oedema. Blood gases were within normal limits. The skull x-ray revealed discrete intracranial calcifications (). A CT scan of the head demonstrated the presence of numerous, symmetrically located calcifications in both frontal lobes, subcortical nuclei, the paraventricular region, brain fornix, as well as both cerebellar hemispheres ().

    "problem": "<Context> A 48-year-old male from West Bengal, in eastern part of India, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of pain and distension of abdomen for 2 h. The patient was having low-grade fever and cough with scanty expectoration for last 1-month along with weight loss of 3 kg during this period. With this clinical picture and bilateral upper zone opacities in X-ray chest [], the patient was put on anti-tubercular therapy in another center (Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse-Category I) though the sputum was negative for acid fast bacilli on Ziehl–Neelson stain on two occasions. On admission, his general examination revealed pulse rate was 112/min and regular, blood pressure was 134/86 mm of Hg, respiratory rate was 36/min and temperature was 100°F. Abdomen was distended, tender with rigidity and guarding. Tenderness was aggravated by movement and cough. Percussion note was tympanitic all throughout the abdomen. On examination of the respiratory system, there was vesicular breath sounds of diminished intensity with coarse crackles bilaterally over infraclavicular areas. Cardiovascular system and central nervous system examination did not reveal any significant abnormality. A diagnosis of perforated hollow viscous abdomen was made provisionally. Routine hematological investigations revealed hemoglobin 110 g/L, total leukocyte count -11.2 × 109/L, neutrophil 68% and lymphocytes 27%. Peripheral smear showed the polymorphonuclear leukocytosis without any parasite or premature cell. Liver enzymes were mildly elevated; aspartate transaminase -64 U/L, alanine transaminase-78 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase -156 U/L. Random plasma glucose was 98 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen -12 mmol/L and creatinine -1.1 μmol/L. Sodium - 134 mEq/L and potassium -3.4 mEq/L. Serum amylase and lipase study was normal. Routine urine examination was normal. HbSAg, anti-hepatitis C virus and HIV tests were negative. Review of old chest radiograph showed infiltrations in bilateral upper zones with increased broncho vascular markings. X-ray abdomen in an erect posture showed free gas under the diaphragm. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed intraperitoneal gaseous distension with intraperitoneal free fluids having internal echogenicity. Patient was urgently shifted to the operation theater for exploratory laparotomy. A midline incision was given. On opening the abdomen, we found around 500 ml of purulent fluid and two small perforations 1cm apart about 20 cm proximal to the ileocaecal junction. After collecting pus sample for microbiological study thorough peritoneal lavage was done, and the perforations were sealed with omental fat. A pelvic drain was given and the incision was closed in a single layer. Postoperative period was eventful as the patient's tidal volume remained low and there was respiratory distress. The patient was shifted to intensive care unit and ventilated mechanically. Patient was treated with intravenous (I/V) piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin. Gram staining of the pus showed Gram-negative bacilli with bipolar staining. The pus culture showed lactose fermenting pink colonies in MacConkey's agar on 2nd day which turned dry and wrinkled on day 4. The blood agar showed dry and wrinkled colonies on day 4 suspicious of B. pseudomallei []. The antibiotic was changed over to ceftazidime 2 g 8 h along with Amikacin. On 6th postoperative day, the organism was confirmed to be B. pseudomallei by the above-mentioned culture characteristics and standard biochemical methods (positive oxidase and nitrate reduction test, arginine dihydrolase activity, oxidation of glucose and lactose). The organism was sensitive to imipenem, doxycyclin, and cotrimoxazole. Antibiotic was switched over to imipenem 1 g 8 h along with doxycyclin 100 mg twice daily. On 9th postoperative day, we could wean off the ventilator and the patient was put on T-piece ventilation with oxygen. On 12th postoperative day, T-piece was removed, and the oxygen saturation was maintained in room air. Imipenem and doxycyclin were continued for a period of 14 days and then the patient was put on cotrimoxazole (160 + 800 mg). The patient was discharged from the hospital on 24th postoperative day with advice to continue cotrimoxazole for 4 months.

    "Lower Limit": "271.172",
    "Upper Limit": "299.716",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mEq. To convert from 134.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 134.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 134.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 134.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 134.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 12.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 12.0 mmol. To convert 12.0 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 12.0 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.012 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.012 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.336 g bun. To convert 0.336 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.336 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 336.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 336.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 33.6 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 12.0 mmol bun/L converts to 33.6 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 98.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 134.0 + (33.6 / 2.8) + (33.6 / 18) = 285.444 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 285.444 mmol/L.

Neither criteria is met and so we do increment the criteria count, keep the current total at 0. The patient note reports 'hormonal use' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0. Hence, the number of PERC rule criteria met by the patient is 0.",

    "problem": "<Context> An 88-year-old female patient (172 cm, 70 kg) with expanding thyroid cancer displacing the larynx to the left was scheduled for total thyroidectomy. Further medical conditions were as follows: atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (grade 3), arterial hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient presented with stridor and dyspnoea during minimal physical exercise. The CT scan of the larynx demonstrated a dislocated larynx to the left and a glottis aperture of 3 × 5 mm (Fig. ). Within the context of a preoperative airway evaluation by an anaesthesiologist, awake fiber-optic laryngoscopy proved a swollen epiglottis (Fig. ). During this examination under light opioid-based sedation with 5 μg sufentanil intravenously and topical anesthesia using lidocaine spray, the patient became short of breath and visualization of vocal cords was impossible.\nOverviewing these clinical findings, we expected difficulties with maintenance of airway patency under sedation or general anesthesia, and we decided to schedule the patient for preoperative awake tracheostomy to secure the patient′s airway. Preoperatively, continuous standard monitoring with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and invasive blood pressure measurement was applied to the patient. In addition, oxygen was administered by nasal probe (4L O2/min), and 150-μg clonidine was administered intravenously because of high arterial pressure, tachycardia, and the sedative side effect without compromising spontaneous respiration.\nAwake tracheotomy was carried out by experienced general surgeons in the operating room under local anesthesia with 30 mL of prilocaine (20 mg/mL). Equipment for difficult airway (i.e., video laryngoscope, different laryngoscope spatulas, Eschmann introducer) and a bronchoscope was available in case of emergency. The patient was hemodynamically and respiratorily stable during the surgical procedure. After tracheotomy was performed successfully, a tracheotomy cannula (8.0 mm) was placed and bronchoscopy verified the correct intratracheal position. Following this, induction of balanced anesthesia with sufentanil and sevoflurane for thyroid cancer surgery was started. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit.\nAt first, the tracheostomy tube could not be removed due to persistent swelling in the area of vocal cord plane. The otolaryngologist suspected infiltration of the thyroid tumor into the trachea. Thus, tracheal cannula was left in situ, and the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on day 8 after surgery. She left hospital on day 17 with a tracheotomy tube in place and was transferred to radiotherapy to a hospital close to her home. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

The patient described this as „the feeling of pins and needles“. There was no previous history of fever, headache, and neurological illnesses. She did not receive any medication. She was non-smoker. Clinical examination revealed a normal developed young girl, with normal memory, speech and orientation, with normal physical exam.\nThe preliminary impression of the emergency staff was of a functional disorder, and the patient was discharged home, with the recommendation to take calcium and magnesium supplements, being well known that the paresthesia of the mouth, hands, and feet is a common, transient symptom of the related conditions of hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks. The patient was called back for a formal neurologic assessment scheduled for the next day. On the same day, the patient came back, with repeated involuntary movements involving her right side (foot, arm and face). She was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit and a diagnosis of Hemichorea-Hemiballismus (HC-HB) was made.\nHypotonia of muscles with normal power and normal deep tendon reflexes were present symmetrically. Her blood pressure was 110/55 mm Hg. Keyser Fleischer ring was absent at slit lamp examination.\nThis clinical symptom of spontaneous hemichorea was considered secondary to a poststreptococcal neurological disease, Sydenham's chorea, but was not associated with other clinical features of rheumatic fever (carditis, arthritis, erythema, rheumatic nodules) and neuropsychological features (dysarthria and emotional disorders). Also, the choreiform movements are rather more continuous in chorea Sydenham than paroxysmal as observed in the described case and the serum anti-streptolysin-O titre was < 200 IU.\nAlso, the possibility of continuous focal seizures (epilepsia partialis continua [EPC]) causing unilateral movements and CNS involvement (the contralateral basal ganglion, the thalamus and the subcortical areas) was considered. As a result, electroencephalography and brain CT and MRI scanning were scheduled.\nIschaemic and haemorrhagic strokes are the cause of chorea in most elderly patients, and these etiologies were excluded in our patient, based on the neuroimaging studies. Other differential diagnosis considered were: encephalitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, basal ganglia calcifications, Wilson's disease, thyroid disease and tuberous sclerosis. CSF was normal, anti-nuclear antibodies were negative, and serum ceruloplasmin and thyroxine levels were within the normal range. Also, the CT of the head did not reveal any lesion in the basal ganglia, as well as brain MRI exam. EEG was normal, even during the ictal recording, excluding the possibility of epilepsy [Fig. , Fig. ].\nMultiple medications in different combinations were tried, including haloperidol, phenobarbital, clonazepam, diazepam, with minimal immediate benefit. Severe pain from the continuous right arm jerking was treated with perfalgan.\nOther laboratory tests revealed: haemoglobin of 13 g%, total count of 8,800/mm3, differential count of N 60 E1 L29, and normal liver function tests. Her urea and serum creatinine were 20 mg% and 0.8 mg% respectively. Urine exam: glycosuria, without ketones. Blood glucose concentration was 367 mg% and glycosylated haemoglobin A1C was 13.9%. Estimated blood osmolality was 294 mosm/L and ketones were absent. Serum sodium: 132 mEq/L; potassium: 4.2 mEq/L; serum calcium and magnesium levels were normal. The diagnosis of diabetes was made and the patient was started on rapid analog insulin subcutaneous, until her blood sugar was brought below 250 mg%, following which long-acting insulin was started and continued for the first day. At the end of 24 hours, her blood sugar was 148 mg% and the involuntary movements had completely disappeared. She remained asymptomatic during her hospital stay and was discharged home on a combination of rapid-acting analog, before meals and long-acting analog insulin (subcutaneous) before dinner.\nGAD antibodies were positive and C-peptide was low. Based on the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (9,000 U/ml; normal < 1. 4 U/ml), low C-peptide and high insulin requirements, we diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L.

Plugging in 9.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 9.0 - 12 = -3.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -3.0 mEq/L.

On admission at the emergency ward, the patient appeared confused and agitated. Core temperature was 38.5°C, heart rate was regular at 150 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 40 breaths/min. Physical examination revealed a supple but tender abdomen, normal peristalsis, and muffled breath sounds over the right lung. Blood analysis showed macrocytic anemia, 18500 leukocytes/mm³, normal enzymes, a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 303 mg/L, and a lactate level of 7.4 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed a silhouette sign over the right heart border and small mediastinal radiolucent streaks of air (). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax confirmed the pneumomediastinum () and showed a dilated oesophagus with a distal tear, bilateral pleural effusions, and heterogeneous retro- and paracardiac collections (). The diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome was made. Blood cultures were taken; intravenous antibiotic therapy (β-lactam + aminoglycoside) and ample fluid resuscitation were initiated. The patient was transferred to the ICU. Two hours after ICU admission, the patient became increasingly oxygen- and vasopressor-dependent. A new chest X-ray revealed a rapidly evolving right pleural effusion (). Subsequently, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. A chest tube was inserted in the right pleural space. A brown, foul-smelling fluid was evacuated. The pleural fluid did not contain food particles, pH was 7, and amylase was 685 U/L. Gastroscopy confirmed an oesophageal tear in the lower one-third of the oesophagus. At that time, a severe concomitant mucosal inflammation precluded further endoscopic treatment because of a too high risk of oesophageal rupture. A control CT scan demonstrated a left-sided paravertebral encapsulated air-fluid collection and a left pleural effusion that had substantially increased in size. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the left pleural space. CT guided drainage of encapsulated pleural collections was performed. Four days after ICU admission, a self-expandable oesophageal stent was endoscopically placed. Despite stenting, continuous bilateral pleural drainage, and broad antimicrobial covering, the patient remained septic with hectic fever and persistently high leukocyte counts and CRP levels.

He was diagnosed to have end-stage renal disease and was on regular bi-weekly maintenance haemodialysis. The patient was on regular medications like antihypertensive drugs, calcium and phosphorous supplements. He had an adequate cardio-respiratory reserve with a normal chest X-ray, ECG and resting 2-D echocardiogram. All investigations, except an Hb level of 8.5 gm% and serum creatinine of 5.8 mg/dl, were within normal limits.\nThe patient was haemodialysed the previous day and premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg orally the night before the operation and on the morning of surgery. The morning doses of antihypertensive drugs were also given with a few sips of water. His preoperative pulse rate, BP, RR, SpO2 were 80/min, 140/80 mm of Hg, 14/min and 98% respectively.\nGeneral anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 100 μg, midazolam 1 mg, thiopentone 250 mg and atracurium 30 mg IV. Trachea was intubated with cuffed ETT of 8.5 mm ID and anaesthesia was maintained with O2: air (40:60), isoflurane 0.6-1% and atracurium infusion @ 0.5 mg/kg/hr. For invasive monitoring triple lumen CVP catheter was placed via the right internal jugular vein approach and right radial artery was cannulated. The surgery was proceeding uneventfully with continuous monitoring of pulse, SpO2 EtCO2, ECG, ST analysis, temperature, IBP, CVP and intermittent ABG analysis (which were all within normal limits). Vascular anastomoses were being done after clamping the external iliac artery and vein. The base line CVP of 8 mm Hg was raised up to 20 mm Hg by rapid infusion of normal saline (collapsible IV bags) with the help of pressure infuser bags and simultaneous 20% albumin infusion. This was done to achieve supranormal intravascular volume to ensure adequate perfusion to the new renal graft. Just after unclamping of the vascular clamps there was a sudden decrease in EtCO2 from 32mm Hg to 15mm Hg followed by decrease in the SpO2 from 98 to 66% with significant bradycardia (HR <45/min) and hypotension. Since there was a clinical suspicion of sudden air embolism (most probably due to entrainment of air in the IVC), immediate resuscitative measures including flooding of operative site with saline, head down with left lateral tilt (Durrant's position), IV atropine 0.6 mg, ventilation with 100% O2 and aspiration of air through distal lumen of CVP line were tried. No obvious air was seen on aspiration and SpO2 returned to 100% with normal EtCO2 tracing within a minute.\nThe surgery proceeded uneventfully with an adequate urine output. The trachea was extubated on the operating table and the patient was shifted to kidney transplant ICU for observation and further management. However, the surgeon was doubtful about entrainment of air into IVC as there was no leak around the anastomotic site. Subsequently we observed that one of the IV sets connected to the proximal lumen of CVP line had air in it and the IV fluid bag inside the pressure infuser bag was empty.\nOn retrospective analysis, it was realized that the self collapsible one litre NS bag was disconnected during the infusion and IV mannitol was connected in that line. Later, after the mannitol infusion, the same NS bag was reconnected and the pressure infuser bag was applied to it for the rapid infusion which resulted in air embolism as the saline infusion had finished unnoticed and the pressurized air entered through the central venous catheter leading to sudden fall in EtCO2, HR, BP and SpO2.\nAs this life threatening situation was immediately recognized due to standard monitoring protocols, the resuscitation measures were started. Left lateral tilt might have allowed the air bubble obstructing the RV outflow tract to be shifted to the superiorly placed right atrium, thereby, allowing the oxygenation and circulation to be restored. The drop in saturation level could have been attributed to overloading with IV fluids, but it would not have been as sudden as in our case. Moreover, the SpO2 in Durrant's position would have worsened in case of fluid overload. Hence fluid overload was unlikely in our case. We established this as the possible cause by simulating the same scenario in vitro. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 92.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 92.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 37.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 37.8 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (92.0 mEq/L + 37.8 mEq/L) = 10.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.2 mEq/L. Plugging in 10.2 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 10.2 - 12 = -1.8 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -1.8 mEq/L.

The pathology assessment of the gastric wall showed a multiple areas of massive, transmural necrosis ().\nPost-operatively, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on mechanical ventilation and treated with inotropes, cefotaxime, metronidazole, gentamicin, and fluconazole. A fourth day of admission, abdominal cultures taken at the laparotomy as well as a blood culture showed Enterococcus faecalis and Candida glabrata infections.\nIn the following days, despite an extensive medical support, her clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and she eventually died on day 26 after admission due to overwhelming infections and progressive multisystem failure. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.809",
    "Upper Limit": "0.895",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 10.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 10.5 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 10.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 10.5 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 10.5 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 10.5 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 10.5 mEq/L) = 23.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 23.5 mEq/L. Plugging in 23.5 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 23.5 - 12 = 11.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 11.5 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 11.5 mEq/L / 13.5 mEq/L = 0.852. The patient's delta ratio is 0.852.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 52-year-old female with a history of admission to the hospital 5 times in the last 5 years because of frequent hypoglycemic attacks was admitted to our hospital.\nAt the age of 36, her urine examination showed excessive glucose levels but she did not receive further medical treatment. The following year, she consulted a doctor due to general malaise and bilateral lower leg edema. She was then diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypoalbuminemia of unknown cause. Glibenclamide was administered for the treatment of diabetes at age of 40, but poor control persisted. She was referred to our hospital for the first time at the age of 43 because of exacerbation of her lower leg edema. Protein-losing gastroenteropathy (PLGE) due to idiopathic gastrointestinal lymphangiectasia was diagnosed by functional and histopathological examinations. She had been treated with elemental diet and steroid therapy for her PLGE, but those treatments were not effective. At the same time, insulin therapy was started because of the poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c, approximately 10%). After the age of 47, her average blood glucose levels were keeping consistently high (300 to 400 mg/dL) and even hypoglycemic attacks had been recognized. When she was hospitalized at the age of 48, the cause of the hypoglycemic attacks was unidentified (2004). Around the age of 50, the frequency of hypoglycemic attacks (defined as blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dL) had increased to about 40 times per month. The attacks occurred at postprandial and preprandial times. Her medication history suggested that hypoglycemia was not related to her insulin therapy. Precise examination of hypoglycemia was performed during the current hospitalization at the age of 52.\nOn admission, her body height was 137 cm and body weight was 44 kg (BMI, 23.4 kg/m2). Blood pressure was 128/78 mmHg and heart rate was 87. Physical examination revealed bilateral lower leg pitting edema, no Achilles tendon reflexes, and reduced sensation of vibration (C128 Hz, 4 s (rt.)/4 s (lt.)). Chest X-ray revealed no pleural effusions and no cardiomegaly. Diabetic complications were confirmed, that is, bilateral proliferative retinopathy, nephropathy (stage 2), and peripheral neuropathy. She was treated with a combination of rapid-acting and NPH insulin injection for her diabetes. The results of laboratory tests were as follows: total protein: 4.0 g/dL; serum albumin: 2.3 g/dL; total cholesterol: 172 mg/dL; triglyceride: 104 mg/dL; HDL-c: 47.4 mg/dL; LDL-c: 116.7 mg/dL; creatinine: 0.49 mg/dL; HbA1c: 15.5%; urinary C-peptide: 125 μg/day; anti-GAD and anti-IA-2 antibodies: negative; urinary microalbumin: 73.8 mg/g·Cre; creatinine clearance: 109.4 mL/min/m2. Blood glucose profiles appeared unstable, with periodic (2 to 3 days) alternation between hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL). Representative blood glucose profiles are shown in , and the frequency of hypoglycemia is shown in . A glucagon loading/stimulation test revealed that the ability of insulin secretion was retained (ΔCPR = 4.8 ng/mL). No abnormalities were found in other endocrine hormones.\nBecause the hypoglycemic attacks occurred at a time after cessation of insulin injections sufficiently longer than the effective time of the insulin, we were convinced that hypoglycemia was not related to the injections. Therefore, we suspected that it was induced by an endogenous cause. The result of a fasting test was positive (). After a 17 h fast, hypoglycemia (plasma glucose 45 mg/dL) appeared and serum insulin concentration was 9.92 μU/mL (normal, <6.0), C-peptide level was 0.98 ng/mL (<0.6), and proinsulin level was 15.3 pmol/L (<5.0). Service's and Turner's criteria for diagnosing insulinoma were satisfied (Grunt 4.54 (positive, <2.5), Fajans 0.22 (>0.3), Turner 66.1 (>50), and Service 9.92 (>6)). Serum C-peptide and proinsulin levels at the time of hypoglycemia attack were significantly high, and the values satisfied the criteria for hyperinsulinism defined by Service []. Also, the proinsulin level was above 5 pmol/L, and this parameter and threshold level have been reported as the best criteria for diagnosis of endogenous hyperinsulinism during the fasting test []. Counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia was not impaired; before and at the time of hypoglycemia, testing showed the following respective levels: glucagon 150 pg/mL and 230 pg/mL; cortisol 6.09 μg/dL and 27.45 μg/dL; growth hormone 0.33 ng/mL and 11.70 ng/mL; adrenaline <10 pg/mL and 583 pg/mL. Tests for both anti-insulin antibody and anti-insulin receptor antibody were negative. We excluded the specific hypoglycemic conditions induced by medicines, insulin autoimmunity, factitious hypoglycemia, and other conditions/diseases such as renal failure or liver cirrhosis. We did not measure plasma sulfonylurea concentration as we were aware that the patient had not been taking the medicine. To investigate the possible involvement of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in the hypoglycemia, we measured serum concentrations of total GIP (Human GIP Assay Kit, Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Fujioka, Japan) and total GLP-1 (YK160 GLP-1 EIA Kit, Yanaihara Institute, Fujinomiya, Japan) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in her fasting, postprandial, and hypoglycemic state. Serum concentrations of total GIP were 7.6, 30.2, and 6.0 pg/mL, whereas those of total GLP-1 were 4.7, 4.2, and 4.1 ng/mL in fasting, postprandial, and hypoglycemic state, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that inappropriate endogenous hyperinsulinemia was responsible for her hypoglycemia, possibly due to insulinoma, nesidioblastosis, or β cell dysfunction.\nThus far, all efforts for obtaining diagnostic imaging of an insulinoma via CT scan, MRI scan, and endoscopic ultrasound were unsuccessful. SACI tests with calcium gluconate (Ca2+ 0.025 mEq/kg) were performed twice in 2004 (age 48) and 2008 (age 52). In keeping with other researchers, an increment in plasma immunoreactive insulin levels greater than 2-fold over prestimulation levels was considered indicative of a tumor or other responsive lesion in the vascular territory of the artery studied []. The results, confirmed twice, were positive only after stimulations of the supramesenteric artery (SMA) (2.53-fold increase in 2004 and 3.36 in 2008 versus before stimulation; Figures and , resp.). No anatomical variant was apparent on review of the angiogram, but there seemed to be backflow slightly in the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) on the examination only in 2008. Exploratory laparotomy was refused by the patient and her family.\nSince she had been suffering mostly from frequent hypoglycemic attacks, we focused primarily on the management of hypoglycemia by medication. We considered the use of octreotide (Sandostatin, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), a long-acting somatostatin analog, because this medicine suppresses insulin secretion [] and has been reported to be effective for PLGE due to idiopathic gastrointestinal lymphangiectasia []. At first, we tried a single dose (50 μg) of octreotide to evaluate its effects on serum insulin and glucose levels (). As we observed no remarkable changes in glucose levels and suppression of insulin levels, we started her on octreotide (50 μg, twice a day) for 2 weeks, monitoring its tolerability. Since almost no side effects except for controllable constipation were determined, we switched to octreotide LAR (Sandostatin LAR, Novartis, 20 mg per month), which is a very long-acting octreotide. After using octreotide LAR for 4 months, although hyperglycemia was uncontrollable even with multiple insulin injections (), the frequency of hypoglycemic attacks was surprisingly reduced (). This effect was sustained for 20 months until her death from acute heart failure (54 years, 2010). On the other hand, serum albumin was slightly increased (2.3 g/dL and 3.0 g/dL; before and after treatment, resp.), but her leg edema was unchanged. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

At the first consultation in the emergency department, she complained of massive abdominal pain since the night before admission, which did not respond to analgesic drugs. Because of the patient’s history of bariatric surgery and the suspicion of SBO, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was inconclusive at the first look with multiple differential diagnoses. It showed a thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and a diverticulum of the duodenum with semisolid contents. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further treatment.\nIn our emergency department, the patient’s general condition was reduced because of pain and signs of diffuse peritonitis. The vital signs showed a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and an accelerated pulse (120 bpm), a respiratory rate of 25/min and a normal body temperature. The blood results showed a leukocytosis with only slightly elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/l). The CT scan was reviewed and revealed the presence of retroperitoneal and parapancreatic fluid with some air bubbles, which could also be seen in an additional abdominal sonography. Further a thickening of the colon ascendens was found (). A perforated duodenal diverticulum was likely and suspected. The thickening of the ascending colon was interpreted as an accompanying colitis.\nAttributable to the reduced condition of the patient with little response to opioids, signs of diffuse peritonitis and our interpretation of the imaging, we decided to perform an explorative transverse laparotomy in the upper abdomen. Although the right colic flexure was mobilized, the exposure of the duodenum was difficult and very limited. However, a hard resistance could be palpated. After a Kocher maneuver and exposing the duodenum and the pancreas dorsally, we were then able to dissect the duodenal diverticulum. The diverticular wall was incised and a biliary stone of the size of ~7 × 4cm was exposed and removed (). Sutures then reattached the duodenal wall. A T-drain was placed intraduodenally, an Easy-Flow drain paraduodenally ( and ). Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for initial surveillance. An empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. After one night, the patient could be transferred to the normal ward in stable condition.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. Pain was controlled with basis analgesia and slowly she returned to a normal diet. Inflammatory markers were declining and antibiotics could soon be stopped. Ten days postoperatively, a fistulography showed a persistent retroperitoneal collection of 3 × 3 cm so the drains were left in situ. Two days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital in proper general condition but with extraduodenal drains still in place.\nOne week after dismissal, the patient felt well with normal appetite and a regular intestinal passage. The fistulography showed a significant reduction of the collection so the T-drain was removed. Two weeks later, she still felt irritated by the last remaining Easy-Flow drainage, which continued showing some turbid liquid and was therefore left in situ. Intestinal passage was unchanged and there were no signs of inflammation. Another 2 weeks later, the drain fell out by accident. Seven weeks postoperatively, still no signs of inflammation, we were able to finish our treatment. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Otorhinolaryngologists planned a septoplasty operation under general anesthesia for him. He had not had any prior operation under general anesthesia, so he did not have any history of difficult intubation, and he did not have any chronic systemic disease. The patient was evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with a comprehensive questionnaire on his sleeping habits and medical history; no complaints or predictors pertaining to OSAS were identified.\nThe patient’s preoperative airway assessment was normal, Mallampati class was II, thyromental distance was 7 cm, inter-incisor gap was 5 cm, and head extension was >35°. His physical examination was characterized by lack of secondary sexual characteristics and presence of fine facial wrinkles. Although, as previously indicated, the patient was married, he had had no children. He had consulted urologists, and primary infertility and erectile dysfunction had been diagnosed. His hormone profile was: testosterone 0.3 ng/mL (reference range 1.75–7.81), free testosterone 0.91 (reference range 4.5–42.0), prolactin 1.31 ng/mL (reference range 2.64–26.72), luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.33 mIU/mL (reference range 1.24–103.03). His thyroid hormone levels were normal. No other pathological finding was obtained as the result of magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland. Thus, the patients was diagnosed with primary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\nHe was admitted to the operating theater, and following the induction of anesthesia with a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenous thiopental, bag-mask ventilation was barely sustained. Fentanyl (1–2 μgr/kg) and, as a muscle relaxant, rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) were administered. While the patient’s head was in the sniffing position, direct laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea were attempted three times with different sizes of Macintosh and Miller blades by an assistant professor of anesthesiology with 5 years’ experience.

Further laboratories demonstrated a hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count 106 K/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 290 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 371 IU/L. She was presumptively diagnosed with HELLP syndrome and admitted for urgent Caesarean section.\nWhile the surgery was uneventful, several hours later she developed acute lower back pain and hypotension. Repeat laboratory studies showed hemoglobin of 6.0 g/dL, platelet count 10 K/mm3, AST 1696 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1253 IU/L, LDH 1262 IU/L. Abdominal ultrasound and CT demonstrated subcapsular and perihepatic hemorrhage with free intraabdominal blood. She was transfused red blood cells and platelets and treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids. Vasopressor agents were required to maintain adequate blood pressure and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was instituted for anuric renal failure.\nFour days after delivery, her mental status deteriorated. She was endotracheally intubated and transferred to our institution for further management. Upon arrival, laboratory studies showed hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL, platelets 39 K/mm3, international normalized ratio 1.49, factor V 32%, blood type O, AST 1319 IU/L, ALT 763 IU/L, bilirubin 7.6 mg/dL, LDH 2215 IU/L, creatinine 4.1 mg/dL, and lactic acid 5.1 mmol/L. Serologic evaluation for other causes of liver disease and human immunodeficiency virus was negative. CMV IgM was negative and IgG was positive. There was no evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome. Head CT showed no apparent cerebral edema.\nAs there were no signs of improvement despite intensive therapy for fulminant hepatic failure, six days postpartum she was listed for liver transplantation as a United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 1. Over the next five days, her clinical course deteriorated further, necessitating 100% forced inspiratory oxygen and high dose vasopressors. Since no suitable ABO compatible livers had been offered, on the fifth day after listing (11 days postpartum), the decision was made to accept a blood type A1 liver.\nOrthotopic liver transplantation was performed using the piggyback technique. The donor was 31 years old with a body mass index of 24 kg/m2. No gross fatty change was appreciated; liver biopsy was not performed. Cold ischemic time was six hours and 40 minutes and warm ischemic time was 23 minutes. Gross inspection of the native liver revealed obvious hepatic rupture, with the organ surrounded by hematoma (). Histology demonstrated massive hepatic necrosis, marked steatosis, widespread bile ductular proliferation, profound cholestasis, and necrotic vessels with intravascular thrombi (Figures and ).\nShe was treated with a renal-sparing immunosuppressive regimen including high dose intravenous immune globulin, thymoglobulin, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate Mofetil, and, beginning on day 7, tacrolimus. Daily plasma exchange was performed with blood group A antigen specific immunoadsorbent columns. Over the first seven days, serum transaminases and coagulation studies steadily improved, although she continued to require full ventilatory support and CRRT. Although somnolent, she became arousable to stimulation. Over the next 48 hours, however, the transaminases and bilirubin worsened. Liver biopsy demonstrated mild reperfusion injury, mild cholangitis, spotty apoptosis, but no cytopathic effect or endothelialitis. A C4d stain was negative. Direct antiglobulin and Coomb's tests were negative on three separate occasions. Biliary obstruction, vascular thromboses and infections, including cytomegalovirus, were excluded (). On postoperative day 11, she was comatose and laboratory studies showed bilirubin 14.5 mg/dL, AST 1747 IU/L, ALT 939 IU/L, INR 1.75. As a result of continued deterioration, she was relisted for transplantation with a MELD score of 35 on postoperative day 15.\nAn ABO compatible liver became available within 24 hours. Histology of the failed allograft demonstrated numerous areas of hemorrhagic necrosis; 30% of the left lobe was completely necrotic (Figures , , and ). On post-operative day 1, the patient became alert and oriented. Over the next several weeks she was extubated and CRRT was discontinued. She was discharged on post-operative day 32 (17 days after re-transplantation) with baseline mental status and normal serum liver tests and creatinine.

However, despite continuing medical treatment for 7 days, consciousness disturbance developed and she was transferred to our hospital. At the time of admission, the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 61 kg. Her body temperature was 37.4°C, her blood pressure was 145/85 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 66/min. There was no blood pressure differential between the right and left arms. The physical examination, including palpations of the lymph nodes, chest and abdomen, was unremarkable. There was mild edema in the lower legs. Neurological examination revealed mild consciousness disturbance with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 (E3V4M5), mild left facial paralysis, and bilateral positive Babinski’s sign. The patient displayed no motor weakness or sensory disturbances. Marked nuchal stiffness and a positive Kernig’s sign were observed.\nThe patient’s laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 12,100/μL with 87.3% neutrophils, C-reactive protein levels of 11.69 mg/dL, and D-dimer levels of 18.1 μg/mL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis disclosed 5 mononuclear cells/μL, a glucose level of 42 mg/dL (CSF-blood glucose ratio: 0.35), and a protein value of 46 mg/dL (Table ). An electroencephalogram revealed frequent bilaterally asynchronous sharp wave activities. Brain MRI revealed hydrocephalus, and high signal intensities in the right cerebellar hemisphere, corona radiata, caudate nucleus, and the left parietal lobe on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure A, B), with corresponding reduced apparent diffusion coefficient maps. No enhancement was observed in these lesions or the meninges on post-contrast T1-weighted images (Figure C, D). MR angiography showed intracranial vessel irregularities and stenoses of the right middle cerebral artery and vertebral artery. Electrocardiography displayed a sinus rhythm. Neither a potential cardiac source of embolism nor a source of the right-to-left shunt, including patent foramen ovale, was demonstrated via transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. A computed tomography scan of the chest detected calcification of the aortic arch. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin.\nThe subacute clinical course, marked nuchal stiffness, and mild mononuclear pleocytosis with a decreased CSF-blood glucose ratio (Table ) led us to consider meningoencephalitis due to tuberculosis or fungi; subsequently, antitubercular and antifungal drugs were administered.

Additionally, CSF culture for bacteria, acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. The CSF cytology on admission revealed adenocarcinoma (Figure ). Tumor markers were within normal ranges. The chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography and gallium scintigraphy findings showed no evidence of malignancy. However, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy disclosed scirrhous gastric cancer, which was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (signet-ring cell). The final diagnosis was meningeal carcinomatosis and excessive coagulation related to occult gastric cancer. Following discussion with the patient’s family, and based on the patient’s age, worsening consciousness levels (GCS of 6 on week 3), and poor performance status, she was transferred to the other hospital 22 days after admission, and supportive care rather than active management was administered. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The day before admission, the man had experienced headache and ocular pain for 3 hours, and then recovered spontaneously. On the day of admission, the symptoms had recurred abruptly and persisted. The headache was dull, and ocular pain was more severe in the lean-forward position. He also complained of blur red vision and lacrimation in the left eye in the supine position. The headache had occurred spontaneously without any history of trauma. He has no past medical history without hypertension.\nThe patient’s vital signs at the time of admission into the ED were as follows: blood pressure, 170/105 mmHg; heart rate, 68 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; body temperature 36.1°C. His mental status was clear. Ophthalmologic examination revealed normal visual field, extra-ocular movement and light reflex. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. To rule out brain lesion, we performed computed tomography (CT) of the brain. No parenchymal lesion or bony deformity was seen in the brain ().\nConsult to neurologist and ophthalmologist was done due to rule out cluster headache and glaucoma. Neurologist ordered brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain to rule out cavernous carotid fistula. The results were normal (). Neurologist requested ophthalmologist consult.\nThe initial ophthalmologic examination revealed normal findings, including normal visual acuity (visus oculi dextri, 1.0 diopter [D], visus oculi sinistri [VOS], 1.0 D), and normal intraocular pressure (normal range, 12 to 22 mmHg). But the patient kept complaining of pain and painkillers were ineffective. We reviewed the CT scan of the brain, and observed lens subluxation in the left eye (). So we consulted to ophthalmologist again. It revealed protrusion of the vitreous body into the anterior chamber, posterior subcapsular opacity, phacodonesis, and lens subluxation toward the nasal area of the left eye, and the ophthalmologist decided him to out-patient department follow up for the possibility of operation.\nSpontaneous zonulysis of the left eye was diagnosed. The symptoms were attributed to a temporary pupillary block and angle closure glaucoma attack. So we recommended him to visit outpatient department and explained the possibility of laser iridectomy in case of aggravation of disease.\nAfter 3 days, he visited the ophthalmologic out-patient department, and initial examination showed fluctuation of vision scale (initial exam VOS 0.1 D; after 1hour exam VOS 0.9 D) in left eye. The intraocular pressure was normal but slit lamp examination revealed further prolapse of the vitreous body into the anterior chamber.\nThere was more progressive inferior dislocation of left lens due to zonulysis in dilated funduscopic examination otherwise normal finding in right eye (). The patient was discharged and an operation was scheduled for 2 days later.\nAfter 2 days, the left eye had been rendered aphakic because of complete dislocation of the lens. Left pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and intra ocular lens (IOL) fixation were recommended by the ophthalmologist.

    "Lower Limit": "1.003",
    "Upper Limit": "1.109",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 97.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 97.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 97.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 97.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 97.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 97.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (97.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 31.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 31.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 31.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 31.0 - 12 = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 19.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 19.0 mEq/L / 18.0 mEq/L = 1.056. The patient's delta ratio is 1.056.",

His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\nThe patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\nWhen asked to score from 0 to 100% the improvement that kratom had on COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue and weakness (80% improvement), tiredness (70% improvement), body aches (80% improvement), muscle pain (90% improvement, “much better than paracetamol/acetaminophen”). The kratom did not seem to have an impact on: fever, cough, or sore throat. The patient also stated: “I didn't have anxiety or any psychological symptoms. For me, kratom mainly gave improvement in physical reaction.” “It also elevated my mood and made me feel less miserable, to the point where I was able to get out of bed, shower, look at work emails without feeling completely exhausted and drained”; “Kratom helped me more than antibiotic”; “I slept better, I essentially fell asleep immediately. Without kratom, sleep was not nice, with kratom less wake ups, about 6 h.” Over the next 2 weeks the patient's symptoms gradually subsided and on May 13 he had a televisit with his physician and a follow-up swab test that was negative for COVID-19. The subject was able to end his quarantine and return to work in early June. In a follow-up interview with us, the patient reported that he did not experience any side effects from using kratom, except for a very bad taste when swallowing it. The patient was also able to discontinue kratom use immediately without any evidence of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms. The patient also informed us that he still had some of the kratom product that he had taken and he agreed to provide us with a sample for chemical analysis.\nAn established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted () and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample. </Context> <Question> What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? </Question>",

He reported intense swelling of the foot with associated weeping of the skin on the right calf but denied paresthesias. Vitals were blood pressure 141/67 mmHg, heart rate 83 bpm, temperature 97.8°F, and 22 respirations per minute. Physical examination showed darkening of the skin on the dorsum of the right foot, bullous formation on the right calf, and tenderness to palpation at right calf (). The left calf also had darkening of the skin, but no muscle tenderness or rigidity on examination (). Pulses were present bilaterally. A basic metabolic panel showed sodium 121 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L), potassium 3.8 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), chloride 91 mEq/L (95–105 mEq/L), bicarbonate 14 mEq/L (22–29 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 27 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), and creatinine 3.75 mg/dL (0.6–1.3 mg/dL). A complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.6×109/L (3.5–10.5×109/L), hemoglobin 9.6×109/L (13.5–17.5 g/dL), and platelets 93×109/L (150–450×109/L). Labs were significant for a lactate of 4.5 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 142 U/L (8–48 U/L). Clinical presentation was suggestive of severe sepsis secondary to the right calf infection. Blood cultures were drawn. Afterward, he was given vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and was taken for surgical debridement of the wound. A tissue sample from the right leg was taken. Exploration of the wound revealed suppurative fluid in the right lower extremity on the medial and lateral sides as well as dead subcutaneous soft tissue. Fascia below was viable and found healthy. After the procedure, he was transferred to ICU due to hemodynamic instability.\nHis medical condition worsened. The morning of his second hospital day (post-operative day 1 from right leg debridement), his WBC was 22.4×109/L, lactate 11.4 mmol/L, troponin 1.34 ng/mL (<0.05 ng/mL), creatine kinase- MB (CK-MB) 16,887 (30–200 IU/L). Dark brown urine was noted in the Foley bag. Urine analysis showed blood, but urine microscopy lacked RBCs. He temporarily began renal replacement therapy for worsening renal failure and was given a blood transfusion for coagulopathy in the setting of liver failure. Due to lack of improvement with medical intervention, the patient was taken to the operating room for right leg fasciotomy. The anterior, medial, and superficial posterior compartment muscle groups showed gross tissue swelling without necrosis. Post-operatively, the CK-MB decreased to 16,134 IU/L.\nThe patient's WBC raised to 29.9×109/L following the surgery and his creatine phosphokinase (CPK) decreased from 16,134 to 14,461 U/L after his right leg fasciotomy, the following day. CT scan, without contrast, of the lower extremities showed diffuse soft tissue edema bilaterally but no gas/abscess under the muscle groups (). Due to lack of clear clinical improvement from his first two surgeries, increased tissue tension in the left lower extremity, the decision was made to perform an exploratory fasciotomy on the contralateral leg.

The concentration of chloride is 91.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 14.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 121.0 mEq/L - (91.0 mEq/L + 14.0 mEq/L) = 16.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 16.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 16.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 16.0 - 12 = 4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 4.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 4.0 mEq/L / 10.0 mEq/L = 0.4. The patient's delta ratio is 0.4.",

The patient was found unconscious and in a bed-ridden state during the early morning on the presenting day. The patient's breathing was shallow and irregular. The patient was unable to walk well due to a coccyx fracture two years ago, but she was able to perform daily life activities with minor help. One week ago, her facial edema started and she complained dry cough and general weakness three days ago. No other medical, familial, or social history was reported, and the patient had not taken any medication. There was also no evidence of intoxication.\nAccording to the records of the local general hospital, the patient had an impending respiratory arrest and comatose mental status. Her blood pressure was 71/48 mmHg, her body temperature was 36.0℃, and her pulse rate was 99 beats/min with a sinus rhythm by electrocardiography (ECG). Neurologic examination revealed pinpoint pupils and a lack of brain stem reflexes, including the light reflex, corneal reflex, gag reflex, and doll's-eye phenomenon. She also showed decerebrated rigidity in response to painful external stimuli. The patient was assigned a score of 5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the Babinski sign was detected at both feet. Brain computed tomography (CT) produced unremarkable results. Endotracheal intubation was performed for protection of the patient's airway, assisted ventilation was initiated, and an inotropic agent was injected to support the patient's state of shock, which did not respond to fluid therapy (1 L of normal saline). Prior to transfer, the patient's blood pressure was increased, but her neurologic findings were not improved. She was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment of a brain stem infarct.\nOn arrival, the patient's blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg, her pulse rate was 59 beats/min, and an intravenous infusion of premixed dopamine was administered (500 mL/800 mg, 20 µg/kg/min). The patient's body temperature was 34.8℃ according to a tympanic membrane thermometer, and her self-respiration was slow and shallow. The patient's lungs on auscultation were bilaterally clear, and cardiac examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The patient's abdomen was soft without signs of guarding, tenderness, or rebound tenderness. A rectal examination revealed no masses, and the patient's stool was guaiac negative. No soiling due to urine or feces was noted on her undergarments.\nThe patient's face and extremities were edematous, and she presented with non-pitting edema. Her skin was dry, cool, pale, and slightly mottled and desquamated; however, there was no evidence of petechiae or purpura ().\nThe patient's level of consciousness was stupor to semi-coma. A neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves and she didn't show lateralizing signs. The patient's pupils were 3 mm across and briskly reactive. It was impossible to check for visual abnormalities and focal cerebellar findings. The results of the Babinski reflex test were negative.\nThe patient's laboratory values were as follows: WBC count 6,000/µL (86% neutrophils), hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, sodium 121 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L, chloride 87 mEq/L, BUN 1.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, glucose 104 mg/dL, ALT 113 U/L, AST 74 U/L, albumin 3.3 g/dL, CK 499 IU/L, CK-MB 21.4 ng/mL, troponin-I <0.02 ng/mL, lactate 1.2 mM/L, urine RBCs 1-4/HPF, and urine WBCs 0-1.5/HPF. Arterial blood gas analysis (FiO2 1.0) revealed a pH of 7.486, a pCO2 of 30.6 mmHg, a pO2 of 36.4 mmHg, a HCO3- concentration of 22.9 mM/L, and an oxygen saturation of 77%.\nA portable chest radiography revealed infiltration of the right lower lung zone and cardiomegaly. ECG revealed sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia; the intervals and axis were normal except for a prolonged QTc interval. Echocardiography revealed a small amount of pericardial effusion, but it did not affect the patient's hemodynamic status.\nDuring our resuscitative efforts, the patient's blood pressure didn't respond and additional laboratory test results confirmed hypothyroidism. The patient's free thyroxine was 0.05 ng/dL (0.93-1.7) and her TSH was 30.12 µIU/mL (0.27-5.0). A diagnosis of myxedema coma exacerbated by community-acquired pneumonia was thus assigned.\nThe patient was referred to the Department of Endocrinology and admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment and ventilatory support. The patient received 1,000 µg of levothyroxine orally for two days, followed by 300 µg/day for an additional three days and finally maintained on levothyroxine 0.1 mg orally each day. Following the administration of synthetic thyroid hormones for hypothyroidism and antibiotics for pneumonia, the patient regained consciousness and respiration. She was transferred to a general ward after two weeks in the intensive care unit and discharged from the hospital one week later. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.734",
    "Upper Limit": "0.812",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 121.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 87.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 22.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 22.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 22.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 22.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 22.9 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 121.0 mEq/L - (87.0 mEq/L + 22.9 mEq/L) = 11.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.1 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 3.3 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 11.1 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.3 (in g/dL)) = 12.85 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.85 mEq/L. Plugging in 12.85 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.85 - 12 = 0.85 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.85 mEq/L. Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.85 mEq/L / 1.1000000000000014 mEq/L = 0.773. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.773.",

He had a previous history of hospitalization six months ago due to the same complaints. The patient was accompanied by his mother. He weighed 6 kg, is the 7th born child to his parents and was delivered at term to a 37-year-old G7P7 mother via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications or illnesses during pregnancy. He cried immediately after birth, and there were no complications during or after birth. There is no consanguinity between mother and father. The child was vaccinated but was malnourished, with an unremarkable family history.\nThe patient also developed diarrhea which was bulky in consistency, green in color with seven episodes per day after every meal intake. Diarrhea was associated with abdominal distention and vomiting. The mother then started giving him a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which diarrhea subsided. The child developed neck holding at four years of age, he started sitting at eight months and started walking with support at 12 months of age. The child was first breastfed within three hours of delivery and was exclusively breastfed up to six months. Complimentary feeding was started after six months with pulses, mashed potatoes, porridge and chicken. Breastfeeding was continued up to two years. Currently, the child takes 1-2 feeds per day. The personal history revealed that the patient was sleeping normally, but the appetite was decreased. The mother also noticed a weight loss, altered bowel habits, and micturition was normal.\nOn examination (O/E), the patient was lying on the bed irritated, severely wasted and emaciated with visible bony deformities. Initial vitals included blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg, a regular pulse of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a low-grade fever of 100° F. The patient was anemic and dehydrated, while, there was no presence of edema, clubbing, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy. On further examination, parietal and frontal bossing, rachitic rosary (Figure ), widening of wrists and knock knees (it's a valgus deformity in which legs curve inwards so that the feet are apart when the knees are touching) were found as well. On abdominal examination, it was soft, non-tender, distended with mild tenderness on both flank regions, with a centrally placed umbilicus. The liver was palpable three fingers below the right costal margin. Gut sounds were audible 3-4 sounds/min. All other systems were unremarkable.\nThe anthropometric measures of the child are as follows: weight = 6.5 kg, occipitofrontal circumference = 49.5 cm, height = 72.5 cm, mid-upper arm circumference = 8 cm, upper segment = 45 cm, lower segment = 27.5 cm, weight for height = 6.5/9 *100 = 72.2 (moderately low) and height for age = 72.5/94.6*100 = 76.6 (severely low).\nOn investigations performed, complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 5.4 gm/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82 fl and a platelet count of 187,000/mL. The total leukocyte count (TLC) was 10.6 x 109/L, including 39% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes. His inflammatory markers were raised with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L [Normal (N) = 3] and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 115 mm/hr (N = 0-22) for men and (N = 0-29) for women. The clotting profile showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.01, while prothrombin time (PT) was 10.6 seconds.\nThe urea creatinine electrolytes (UCE) were within normal range except decreased potassium levels of 2.8 mEq/L. The levels of calcium, magnesium and phosphate in blood were 15.1, 1.9 and 4 mg/dL, respectively. The blood culture showed a growth of Burkholderia species. The urinalysis showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity of 1.025, with the presence of protein and blood. Additionally, numerous red cells were seen along with yeast and 4-6 pus cells per high power field (HPF). The urine culture showed growth of Candida species. The stool analysis showed that the stool was hard, acidic, brown in color with 1-2 pus cells per HPF. His vitamin D levels came out to be 54.29 ng/mL, and parathyroid levels were 8.36 pg/ml. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.28 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.21 mg/dL and levels of alkaline phosphate alanine aminotransferase were 368 and 3 units per liter, respectively.\nThe X-rays of the chest (Figure ), skull (Figure ) and femur (Figure ) are attached below. Additionally, ultrasound of kidney ureters and bladder (KUB) showed an incidental finding of bilateral renal calculi (right kidney at lower pole measuring 0.7 cm, in the left kidney at mid pole measuring 0.7 cm), along with bilateral grade 2 renal parenchymal changes. The urinary bladder was normal in thickness with no presence of focal mass, calculus or diverticulum.\nConsidering the diagnosis of OI, an ophthalmology review was done to look for lens dislocation and blue sclera, but neither was present in both eyes. However, the left eye showed a corneal thinning nasally, temporally and inferiorly.\nDuring the hospital stay, the patient was intravenously given cefotaxime 220 mg, piperacillin-tazobactam 700 mg, and meropenem three times a day.

His symptoms commenced 1 week prior to hospital admission, starting with pain in the entire left lower limb, and then edema, with the thigh worse than the lower leg, and finally pallor of the entire left lower limb. He denied any trauma, history of thromboembolic disease, shortness of breath, chest pain, alcohol consumption, smoking history, recreational drug use, or family history of hypercoagulable disorders. Past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was managed with oral gliclazide MR 120 mg once daily and oral metformin XR 1000 mg once daily. He has no other significant medical history or family history and was not on any other regular medications. He was unemployed and lived in a rural town with a friend. On clinical examination, his left thigh was more swollen than his lower leg, with associated tenderness and pallor. The left femoral, popliteal, tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable. His lower-limb neurological examination was normal, with intact sensation and 5/5 power in all movements bilaterally. He had a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and was afebrile at 36.5 ℃. Initial assessment with computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated no significant arterial disease. He was then found to have extensive DVT over the entire length of the left lower limb on venous Doppler ultrasound (US), involving the left fibular, soleus, and gastrocnemius veins up to the popliteal vein, femoral vein, common femoral vein, and external iliac vein (Fig. ). He had normal renal function, serum urea, electrolyte levels, creatine kinase, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and full blood examination. He had elevated serum C-reactive protein at 59 mg/L (normal range <10), a slightly elevated fibrinogen at 5.0 g/L (normal range 1.5–4.0 g/L), and mildly high gamma-glutamyl transferase of 107 U/L (normal range <65 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase of 135 U/L (normal range 30–110 U/L). Otherwise, his coagulation profile and liver function test were normal. Plasma D-dimer was 12.62 µg/ml fibrinogen-equivalent units (normal range <0.50). The initial impression of the clinical picture was phlegmasia alba dolens. He was given an intravenous heparin loading dose of 5000 units and then commenced on an intravenous heparin infusion at a rate of 1080 units per hour, titrated according to the activated partial thromboplastin time (target range of 60–85 seconds) and transferred to the vascular surgery unit of a metropolitan hospital for further management.\nFurther investigation with CT pulmonary angiogram and CT venography of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral interlobar and segmental pulmonary emboli, and compression of the left common iliac vein with an extensive thrombus of the left common iliac, internal, and external iliac veins, consistent with MTS (Figs. and ). The Interventional Radiology team subsequently inserted a temporary Cook Celect Platinum inferior vena cava (IVC) filter via the right internal jugular vein. The left common iliac vein was cannulated, and venography showed an extensive thrombus across the left common femoral, external, and common iliac veins. AngioJet mechanical thrombectomy, thrombolysis using 200,000 units of urokinase, angioplasty, and stenting of the left common femoral, external, and common iliac veins, using two Cook Zilver Vena venous self-expanding stents of 16-mm diameter and 63-mm length each were all performed successfully (Fig. ). On discharge from hospital, he wore left lower limb compression stockings, and the heparin infusion was switched to subcutaneous therapeutic enoxaparin 60 units twice per day. Oral anticoagulation was not used because of its slightly higher risk of future thrombosis, when compared with enoxaparin. He received intravenous heparin infusion for 4 days. His IVC filter was removed 10 weeks later without complication.\nTherapeutic enoxaparin was continued until a follow-up appointment at the hematology clinic 4 months later. His thrombophilia screen was overall negative, with a negative prothrombin gene mutation, normal protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1, and anticardiolipin antibody. He had marginally low antithrombin at 73% (normal range 80–120%); however, this may have been related to the presence of thrombosis or heparin therapy at the time of testing, rather than an underlying genetic disorder. Factor V Leiden will be tested at his next appointment. He was advised to remain on anticoagulation until next follow-up and was switched from therapeutic enoxaparin to oral apixaban 5 mg twice per day because of convenience of use despite a slightly higher risk of future clots.

    "problem": "<Context> A 49-year-old female patient came to the outpatient clinic with complaint of general weakness, mild discomfort and heat sensation in the abdomen. Diagnosed with PNET with multiple liver metastases at another hospital, she was transferred to our clinic for bloodless surgery owing to the patient's religious faith. The patient's height was 152 cm and weight was 53.6 kg. She didn't have any other underlying medical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, tuberculosis and so on. Physical exams revealed mildly distended abdomen and a non-tender palpable intraabdominal mass. The serum tumor markers including CEA, CA 19-9, and α-FP were within normal limits, whereas liver function test levels including total bilirubin (1.3 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase (58 U/L), and alanine transaminase (49 U/L) were slightly elevated. Radiological tools including abdominal-pelvic CT scan, biliary and pancreas dynamic MRI with contrast, PET/CT scan, and bone scan contributed to diagnosis and therapeutic plan. According to the results of radiological imaging studies, a huge well capsulated tumor (about 8-cm diameter on the longest distance) was located in the pancreatic body and tail, which was highly enhanced by the contrast material. Multiple hepatic metastases were found in both lobes ().\nSono-guided biopsies on liver and pancreas showed proliferation of uniform round cells in ribbon, consistent with metastatic well-differentiated PNET from the pancreas. Results revealed positive staining of chromogranin A and cytokeratin (CK). Ki67 labeling index was about 4%-5% that corresponded to grade 2. For treatment of PNET with multiple liver metastases, serial therapies were scheduled. First of all, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed prior to surgery. The interventional radiologist performed TACE with mitomycin and lipiolol, which were injected to the patient's metastatic hepatic tumors. After a total of 3 sessions of successful TACE for multiple liver metastases over 4 months (), the size of multiple liver metastases decreased dramatically in the following abdomen CT (). Meanwhile, the patient suffered from liver failure with total bilirubin increased up to 23 mg/dL. Careful conservative management without transfusion was carried out for treatment of liver impairment. For the systemic treatment, octreotide acetate injection was given before surgery. Initial dose was 0.1 mg via subcutaneous injection every 8 hours over 3 days for response test, and then 4 injections at 20 mg were given daily via intramuscular route per 28 days.\nThe attending surgeon and anesthesiologist discussed the risks of bloodless major operations. The patient signed a consent form for the operation without the use of blood products. She allowed albumin and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH). Considering that it was a cancer surgery, Cell Saver was not allowed due to risk of shed cancer cells. The preoperative albumin level was 3.7 g/dL, hemoglobin was 12.6 mg/dL, and hematocrit was 36.8%. The dissection of RAMPS procedure started from the left side, which is the neck of the pancreas, to the right side with splenic vessels and celiac node dissection. Afterwards, the plane of dissection proceeded posteriorly in a sagittal plane along the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery down to the level of the aorta, in sequence, going on laterally to the left adrenal gland (). There was severe adhesion of omentum to the hepatic tumors and pancreatic tumor, however, the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery were relatively well isolated from the tumor. The pancreatic tumor was well vascularized, capsulated, and abutted to the renal arteries and veins, but not invading (). Histological diagnosis was consistent with well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with negative resection margin but extending to the peripancreatic soft tissue and splenic venous wall. It showed angioinvasion and neural invasion containing ischemic necrosis. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that chromogranin A, CD56, CD10, and CK were positive (). Pathologic staging was T3N0M1 stage IV according to American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging for pancreatic tumors.\nTotal operative time was 4 hours 30 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 800 mL and while the patient received 3 pints of ANH and intravenous dextran during the operation. The postoperative albumin was 2.8 g/dL, hemoglobin 11.5 mg/dL, hematocrit 33.8%, and fibrinogen 248 mg/dL. As an assistant therapy for a transfusion free patient, recombinant human erythropoietin 4,000 IU and 1 ample of iron hydroxide sucrose complex were given daily for five days after surgery.

    "problem": "<Context> A 37-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of his left sided hemiplegia that he had experienced for 3 months. He was known to be positive for HIV, as was determined during evaluation for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a foreign country about 6.5 years before this admission. At that time, he had been treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and saquinavir for the management of AIDS for 9 months and then he discontinued therapy of his own will. He was advised to restart treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir at our hospital 4 years ago. He noticed weakness on the left side of his body during movement, which had slowly progressed and he finally developed left-sided hemiplegia 3 months previously. At the time of admission, he had complaints of headache and night sweats. He was diagnosed as having idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura about 6.5 years ago and so splenectomy was done. Even after splenectomy, the thrombocytopenia continued. He was treated with steroid, vincristine, intravenous gammaglobulin, rituximab and danazole. He had also experienced liver abscess 4 years ago. He had received radiation for Kaposi sarcoma about 8 months before admission. On admission, the blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, the pulse rate 100/min, the respiration rate 22/min and the body temperature was 38℃. Upon physical examination, the patient was in poor general condition with anemic conjunctiva. There were no signs of hemorrhagic diathesis or icterus. The laboratory finding were as follows; hemoglobin 7.4 g/dL, WBC 8,300/mm3 (neutrophila: 79.5%, lymphocytes: 14.6%, monocytes: 4.6%), platelets 10,000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 2 mm/h, AST 24 IU/L, ALT 9 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, LDH 473 IU/L, protein 3.9 g/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, BUN 9.5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.42 mg/dL, calcium 7.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.1 mg/dL, Na 130 mmol/L, K 3.0 mmol/L, the total number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was 46/mm3 and 621/mm3, respectively, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was 0.07. The chest X-ray was not remarkable. Brain MRI () shows 4 cm-sized round mass involving the right frontal lobe. The T1 weighted image and the T2 weighted image () showed extensive areas of perilesional edema involving the right frontoparietal region and there was a mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle. Stereotactic biopsy of the brain lesion was performed, and histological examination disclosed atypical lymphoid cells with a predominant perivascular arrangement (). Immunohistochemical examination showed positivity for CD20. The diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the CNS was made. The patient was treated with brain radiation. Sadly, he died of pneumonia 13 days after brain radiation therapy. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "2",
    "Upper Limit": "2",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.0 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 100.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8300.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 1 + 1 = 2 criteria met. Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2.",

The patient had diabetes for 20 years and suffered from diabetic retinopathy. He had unremarkable medical and family histories, but a smoking history of 90 packs per year. Chest CT revealed a 30 mm mass in the right upper lung lobe and mediastinal lymph nodes with advanced calcification (Fig ). Transbronchial biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) showed increased tumor uptake, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.16, and slight FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes. No metastases were detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging or FDG-PET (Fig ). Mediastinal lymph node #4 had a short-axis diameter < 1 cm, but was considered potentially to be lymph node metastasis because of the slight accumulation of FDG-PET; therefore, preoperative adjuvant treatment was performed. HgbA1c of 10.5 indicated diabetes was poorly controlled and required treatment before surgery. Diabetic nephropathy did not coexist and blood calcium and phosphate concentrations were within the standard range. During diabetes treatment, he received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The patient achieved no significant radiological improvement with two courses of this regimen. Based on radiological findings, he was diagnosed with yc-T1cN0M stage 1A, and surgical treatment was planned. He underwent right upper lobectomy and dissection of the upper mediastinal lymph nodes (2R and 4R). The lymph nodes were firmly adherent to the surrounding tissue, the sidewall of the superior vena cava was firmly fused, and there was invasion of the vascular wall. Despite this, the lymph nodes and superior vena cava sidewall were removed. The chest drain tube was removed on postoperative day 3 and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 14. Macroscopically, the tumor was well circumscribed and most of the tumor was calcified (Fig ). There was no bronchial or pleural involvement within the tumor. Acinar adenocarcinoma tissue was mixed with calcified tissue and PBs were confirmed. Similar features were found in calcified lymph nodes. The tumor was diagnosed as p-T2aN2M0 stage 3A (Union for International Cancer Control eighth edition). Immunohistochemistry revealed tumor cells positive for parathyroid hormone-related proteins (PThrP) 1 and 2. Postoperative examination indicated PThrP levels were within the standard range. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 36 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.

Her son, the primary caregiver, shared that the patient was recently discharged from subacute rehab following a below-knee amputation (BKA) and had been having diarrhea. No further review of systems was obtainable due to her clinical status.\nUpon arrival, her blood pressure was 113/48 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% non-rebreather mask, the temperature of 36.6° C. Physical exam revealed an elderly, frail female who was not oriented. She had bilateral coarse rhonchi on auscultation of her lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. The heart exam was normal. The abdomen was tender to palpation as facial grimacing was noted. A PD catheter was in place, and the site was clean. The patient did not follow commands, but the neurologic exam was non-focal.\nFurther workup revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 27 mg/dL, creatinine 3.8 mg/dL (at baseline), mild hypokalemia at 3.5 mMol/L, leukocytosis at 13.5/mm3. A stat computed tomography of her head showed no acute intracranial process, and a chest X-ray revealed a right pleural effusion with possible right lower lobe opacities, which were unchanged from the previous studies (Figure ).\nShe was then started on empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline, and admitted to the intensive care unit for severe sepsis. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended switching cefepime to ceftriaxone as the patient’s mental status continued to deteriorate, in addition to sending peritoneal fluid for analysis and culture. While awaiting PD fluid cultures, her blood cultures grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), leading to concerns for infective endocarditis given her AVR history. The peritoneal fluid analysis revealed neutrophilic predominance with results as follows: 3,938 nucleated cells, 82% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Although receiving empiric antibiotic therapy, the patient’s clinical condition continued to deteriorate. On the fifth hospital day, the patient’s peritoneal fluid culture revealed Enterococcus gallinarum resistant to vancomycin. The patient was subsequently placed on IV daptomycin and cefazolin for synergy with improvement in her mental status within 48 hours. Repeat peritoneal fluid analysis showed decreased leukocytes and clearance of her E. gallinarum on repeated fluid cultures. The susceptibilities for E. gallinarum are listed in Table .\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed as the patient also had persistent MRSA bacteremia, which did not show any vegetations or mass. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) subsequently revealed a large globular deformation of the posterior mitral leaflet bulging into the left atrium, measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm in size that was concerning for mitral valve abscess (Figures -). Unfortunately, due to the patient's worsening clinical status and considering the overall prognosis, the patient was placed in hospice care and died several days later.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 68 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45. The patient's weight is 75.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mEq. To convert from 137.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 137.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 137.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 137.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 137.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.45 * 75.0 * (137.0/140 - 1) = -0.723 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.723 L.",

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed severe, circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with the involvement of distal esophagus and the first portion of the duodenum in addition to perigastric stranding; findings were reported to be consistent with severe gastritis (). There was also mild mucosal thickening of the transverse and descending colon. The liver was enlarged with fatty infiltration. A small amount of ascites with small left-sided pleural effusion was seen throughout the peritoneum. No obstruction, perforation or intrabdominal abscess was seen. Based on her subtle presentation, physical exam and hemodynamic stability, primary peritonitis was deemed less likely upon initial assessment. Therefore, she was admitted to a medical floor with the provisional diagnoses of alcohol-related gastritis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute kidney injury. She received a 2-litre bolus of intravenous (IV) normal saline and was started on maintenance fluid, IV antiemetics, and IV pantoprazole.\nWithin 8-hours of admission, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with subsequent intubation and fluid resuscitation. She was transferred to the intensive care unit. Because of bright red blood on nasogastric decompression, she was started on IV octreotide given her history of chronic alcoholism and possible variceal bleed. Because of hypotension and SIRS with peritoneal ascites, blood cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin). A diagnostic paracentesis was performed obtaining 1.2 liters of thick serosanguinous peritoneal fluid. Ascitic fluid analysis was suggestive of monomicrobial primary peritonitis, showing abundant Gram-positive cocci and 51,500 leucocytes/mm3 with 67% neutrophils. Ascitic fluid was exudative in nature with total protein 3.8 g/dl, albumin 1.6 g/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 5189/UL and glucose 56 mg/dl. Serum-albumin ascitic-albumin gradient was 0.9 g/dl.\nNo surgical intervention was considered as the possibility of secondary peritonitis was less likely based on her CT and ascitic fluid findings. Blood cultures and ascitic fluid cultures were positive for GAS, and therefore, the patient was started on IV ampicillin and clindamycin for primary GAS peritonitis.\nBecause of hematemesis, the patient underwent EGD that showed diffuse gastric ulcerations, but no esophageal varices or active bleeding. Given diffuse ulceration of stomach with circumferential wall thickening, gastritis was thought to be caused by an underlying ischemic or infiltrative process.\nAlthough the patient’s hemoglobin was stable, and she had required no blood transfusions, her hemodynamic status started to deteriorate requiring multiple pressor support and IV high-dose hydrocortisone. Given the context of isolation of GAS from blood and ascitic fluid, septic shock and multiorgan failure (renal failure and liver failure), a diagnosis of STSS was made. Her lactic acid level worsened from 2.8 at baseline to 42 mM/L. The patient was deemed a non-surgical candidate by the surgical team. However, an ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal drain was placed for therapeutic reasons. The patient received few doses of antibiotics; however, she continued to deteriorate and succumbed to death within 48-hours of admission due to cardiopulmonary arrest and multiorgan failure. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "4.75",
    "Upper Limit": "5.25",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 94.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 94.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 94.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 94.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 94.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 94.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L - (94.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 17.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 17.0 - 12 = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 5.0 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 26-year-old man presented black stools and anemia. He had not taken any medication and had no specific family or past medical history. His height and weight were 172.3 cm and 93.4 kg (the body mass index was 31.5 kg/m2). His body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 137/77 mmHg and radial pulse rate was 80 beats/min and regular. Complete blood count showed the red blood cell count of 326 × 104/μl, hemoglobin concentration of 8.6 g/dl (reference range: 13.5 to 17.6 g/dl), and mean corpuscular volume of 87 fl. Serum chemistry showed that hemoglobin A1c was 4.2% (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program number). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large pedunculated polyp arising from gastroduodenal junction, close to pyloric ring on the side between minor curvature and anterior wall (Figure \nA). The head of the polyp was incarcerated toward duodenal lumen. The lower side of the polyp showed hemorrhage in part. The stalk was too thick to be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection. Instead, distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. No metastasis was found in the dissected lymph nodes.\nThe postoperative period was uneventful that the hemoglobin concentration gradually increased and became 11.6 g/dl on day 12. He was subsequently discharged without any complications and was in good health with 1 year follow-up.\nThe surgically resected specimen showed a lobulated polyp sized 6.4 × 3 cm (Figure \nB) and the cut surface was solid and white (Figure \nC). Histologically, the stalk of the polyp projected from duodenal mucosa, not pyloric mucosa. In the lesion, marked proliferation of Brunner’s glands was noted showing lobular structures separated by fibromuscular septa (Figure \nA). Acini and ducts were well preserved (Figure \nC) and cystically dilated ducts were scattered (Figure \nB). Lymphocytic infiltrate was observed in the entire lesion and lymphoid follicle formation was intermingled in and between the lobules of hyperplastic Brunner’s glands (Figure \nB). The upper two thirds of the polyp was covered by a surface epithelium histologically similar to gastric foveolar epithelium (Figure \nA), randomly with surface erosions (Figure \nE). No evidence of malignancy was found within the specimen (Figure \nC). These findings suggested that the lesion was composed of normal tissue elements of duodenal mucosa and submucosa, but formed a disorganized aberrant mass. Thus, we diagnosed this lesion as Brunner’s gland hamartoma. Helicobacter pylori infection was not detected in Giemsa stain.\nThen, we sought to clarify the possible pathogenesis of this lesion by immunohistochemical analyses for mucin phenotypes, CDX2 expression and MIB-1 labeling. The surface epithelium resembling gastric foveolar epithelium was positive for MUC5AC (Figure \nB), indicating gastric foveolar metaplasia, while the epithelium in deeper portion and Brunner’s glands were positive for MUC6 (Figure \nC). The epithelial cells at the transition zone between MUC5AC- and MUC6-positive areas showed concomitant expression of MUC5AC and MUC6 (Figure \nB and C). These results confirmed that the surface epithelium differentiated towards gastric foveolar epithelium but preserved intestinal epithelial nature in the deeper portion. Interestingly, the MUC5AC-positive epithelium and adjacent MUC6-positive epithelium were diffusely positive for MIB-1 (Figure \nD), and the Brunner’s glands beneath them showed high MIB-1 labeling index (7.9%; Figures \nD and\nA).\nThe similar staining pattern was observed in the area with surface erosion (Figure \nE-H), where most of surface epithelium was lost, but the deeper portion of the epithelium was minimally left (Figure \nE), showing MUC5AC/MUC6 double positivity (Figure \nF and\nG) with significantly high MIB-1 labeling (Figure \nH). Moderately high MIB-1 labeling of Brunner’s glands (9%) was accompanied (Figures \nH and\nB).\nOn the other hand, surface epithelium in the lower part of the polyp showed a villous structure containing goblet cells without apparent gastric foveolar metaplasia (Figure \nI). Immunohistochemically, positivity of MUC5AC staining decreased in the lower one third of the polyp, particularly on the distal side. In the same area, CDX2-positive nuclei (Figure \nJ) and MUC2-positive goblet cells (Figure \nK) were observed at the surface epithelium showing intestinal nature. Below the surface epithelium preserving intestinal nature, Brunner’s glands had less proliferative activity with low MIB-1 labeling index (0.77%) (Figures \nL and\nC). These results suggest that gastric foveolar differentiation is possibly related with the observed proliferative activity of Brunner’s glands. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 47-year-old man (body weight 62.1 kg and height 166.8 cm) was reported in our hospital with a past medical history of tongue cancer that was operable. The preoperative spirometry test, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. He is a non-smoker with no history of cerebrovascular disease. In his thirties, he had undergone resection of the mandibular area with plate reconstruction for treatment of tongue cancer; however, the site became infected and the plate was removed 8 months before presentation. The patient returned for reoperation involving a free abdominal muscle flap with vascular anastomosis and partial mandibular resection with tracheostomy. After surgery, the patient was in the ICU for deep sedation and ventilator management for 48 h, until the vascular anastomosis stabilized. Initially, the iASV ventilator mode was selected to change only the percentage minute volume (%MV) automatically. On the postoperative day 3, the patient’s oxygenation worsened, and purulent sputum increased; fiberoptic suctioning of sputum was performed once along with sputum culturing. Although no significant organism was detected with sputum Gram staining, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas otitidis were detected in the sputum culture test. We therefore arrived at a diagnosis of VAP and changed the patient’s antibiotic from ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5 g per 6 h to meropenem 0.5 g per 8 h. At the time of entering the ICU, his PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 462, which indicated a good oxygenation capacity; this decreased to 171.5 at the time of VAP diagnosis. At the same time, the other patient entered the ICU with a severe respiratory emergency. We continued the iASV mode as we judged that the respiratory condition could be improved. PEEP and FiO2 were selected as additional automatic settings in iASV, %MV was automatically set, and the delta P (ΔP) approximating the driving pressure did not exceed 10 cm H2O. (Figs. and ).\nArterial blood gas (PaO2, PaCO2, and pH) was measured every 6 h to confirm that his respiratory condition was within the expected range.\nOnce the patient’s oxygenation capacity started improving, the INTELLiVENT®-ASV started to show a decline in FiO2, first until it reached 0.3, and then reduced PEEP from 14 to 5 cm H2O based on the lung protective ventilation strategy. Two days after changing the antibiotics to treat VAP, his WBC, CRP, and the sputum secretion from the lungs decreased, indicating resolution of VAP. Therefore, mechanical ventilation was successfully withdrawn. During this time, the ΔP obtained by subtracting PEEP from the inspiratory plateau pressure was kept below 10 cm H2O (Fig. ).\nWe used dexmedetomidine (0.2γ to 0.5γ) and propofol (1 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) for sedation during his admission in ICU. We continued the same sedation dosage after VAP diagnosis, and after stopping ventilator usage, the propofol administration was also stopped. Dexmedetomidine was continued after extubation at night for the purpose of sleeping.\nTwo days after stopping ventilator usage, the patient’s respiratory condition was stable and he was transferred to the general ward. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 84.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 24000.0 count/µL. To convert 24000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 24000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 24000000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3.

The patient noted bloody bowel movements with diarrhea for several days, which had increased in frequency over the past 24 hours. The patient reported mild abdominal pain and denied nausea, emesis, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or other symptoms at the time. He was not on anticoagulation and denied excessive alcohol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His family history was significant for NF-1 diagnosed in his mother and brother. He had no significant surgical history other than a total hip replacement.\nOn admission at the outside hospital, the patient’s hemoglobin was 6.6 g/dl, with normal platelets, partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. Diagnostic workup at the outside institution included a nuclear medicine gastrointestinal scan (mTc-labeled RBCs), which was negative for abnormal bleeding. On hospital Day 2, his hemoglobin failed to respond appropriately to transfusions and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was completed, which showed a 6.9 × 5.8 × 6.8 cm hyper-vascular mass in the left pelvis; abutting the left border of the bladder medially, iliac arteries and veins posteriorly, rectus sheath anteriorly and the small and large bowel (). Vascular supply of the mass was identified to originate from branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and appeared to be contiguous with the adjacent jejunum. The mass was noted to also abut, but not involve, the sigmoid colon. The CT scan further noted a 9 mm enhancing tumor in the second portion of the duodenum anteriorly (). After administration of five total units of packed red blood cells with limited improvement in hemoglobin, the patient was transferred to our institutions for further management.\nThe patient arrived hemodynamically stable and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The EGD was unremarkable with no visualization of the previously mentioned duodenal mass. Colonoscopy was performed, which was notable for bright red blood present throughout the entire colon as well as blood 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (). As the patient continued to have bloody output per rectum, with insufficient response to transfusion, interventional radiology was consulted and proceeded with mesenteric angiography with intervention (). The hyper-vascular mass was found to be supplied by ileal branches of the SMA, which were successfully embolized (). After conversations with the interventional radiology team and the patient, the decision was made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the identified mass.\nExploratory laparotomy was notable for a 7 cm mass originating from the distal jejunum (). This mass was mostly exophytic and a single firing of a GIA load was used to excise the mass with preserved adjacent normal wall of the jejunum. Kocherization of the duodenum revealed a single sub-centimeter duodenal mass at D2. The mass was excised with subsequent primary closure of the defect. Taking down the Ligament of Treitz allowed us to identify two additional proximal jejunal lesions that were resected and resulting defects were primarily closed. The remainder of the jejunum was evaluated and a stretch of proximal jejunum, about 10 cm from Treitz, containing 10 small (0.5 to 2 cm) lesions was identified (). The decision was made to resect a 30 cm segment of jejunum with creation of a side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis using a linear stapler. This allowed complete resection of macroscopic disease. The mesenteric defect was closed using multiple interrupted silk sutures. The remainder of the bowel was examined and found to be normal. The patient returned to the intensive care unit and recovered over the course of the coming days without immediate complications and without requiring additional transfusions.\nFive surgical specimens were sent to pathology, including the large intra-abdominal mass, a segment of proximal jejunum (30 cm), the duodenal lesion and two proximal jejunal lesions. Microscopic examination revealed a total of 13 foci of tumor. All tumor margins were negative and 12 regional lymph nodes were examined and revealed no evidence of nodal metastases. All tumors underwent H&E staining () and immunohistochemical staining for DOG-1 (), which was strongly positive, confirming a diagnosis of GIST for all tumors.\nGenetic analysis of the tumors samples was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue using the Tempus XT next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, which includes 648 cancer-related genes. No KIT or PDGFRA mutations were detected (both were wild type). Instead, NF-1 was found to harbor a loss-of-function single nucleotide alteration (c.654 + 1G > T splice region variant).\nThe patient recovered appropriately from his surgery and was discharged one week after the operation.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 20.0 lbs so this converts to 20.0 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 9.072 kg. For patient's with weight less than 10 kg, the rule for computing maintenance fluid is to multiply their weight by 4 mL/kg/hr to get the maintenance fluids per hour. Hence, the patient's maintenance fluid is 9.072 kg * 4 mL/kg/hr = 36.288 mL/hr. Hence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 36.288 mL/hr.",

She had also experienced tetany of the hand and foot for several months. At her full-term birth, her weight was 2.75 kg. Her family history had no history of renal, endocrinologic, or cardiovascular disease. Her father's height was 170 cm, her mother's 155 cm, and the midparental height, 156 cm. She had no history of diuretics use. Her height was 138.4 cm (<3rd percentile, -2.33 standard deviation score [SDS]); her weight was 43.3 kg (25th-50th percentile, -0.23 SDS); her body mass index was 22.7 kg/m2 (85th-90th percentile). The puberal stage was breast II and pubic hair I, and her bone age, according to the Greulich-Pyle method, was 11 years. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg. Initial biochemical analysis revealed, on the basis of the following values, metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia: sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 2.4 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 5.8 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 48 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 67 U/L, pH 7.467, PCO2 47.4 mmHg, HCO3- 34.5 mmol/L (normal range, 22 to 26 mmol/L), base excess 9.6 mmol/L (-4 to 2 mmol/L), total calcium 9.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.7 mg/dL. Further laboratory investigation showed the following: magnesium 1.48 mg/dL (1.5 to 2.3 mg/dL), serum osmolality 218 mOsmol/kg (275 to 295 mOsmol/kg), renin 32.66 ng/mL/hr (<4.2 ng/mL/hr), and aldosterone 361.28 pg/mL (20 to 220pg/mL). Urine test results were as follows: Na+ 61 mEq/L, K+ 29.0 mEq/L, Cl- 57 mEq/L, osmolality 641 mOsmol/kg (50 to 1400 mOsmol/kg), spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio <0.02 mg/mg (0.03 to 0.2 mg/mg), 24 hours urine calcium 0.62 mg/kg (1.0 to 4.0 mg/kg/day), 24 hours urine magnesium 0.74 mg/kg (2.82±0.79 mg/kg/day). The calculated transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) had increased to 8.078.\nThe patient had normal thyroid and parathyroid function. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys and diffuse mild fatty infiltration of the liver. GH stimulation tests for short stature revealed complete deficiency (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no remarkable findings. Her intelligence quotient as measured by the Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III test was 67. Whole-blood DNA sequencing showed heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (). Although her sister and brother were not genetically evaluated, they showed normal electrolyte and blood gas readings.\nThe patient was treated with 0.7 IU/kg/wk of GH and administered oral replacement of magnesium oxide (MgO, 1 g) and potassium chloride (KCl, 1.8 g). Serum photassium and magnesium level increased to 3.0 mEq/L and 1.85 mg/dL. She showed a 5.6 cm height gain over seven months.

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 9 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6. The patient's weight is 43.3 kg. The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 43.3 * (139.0/140 - 1) = -0.186 L.

Until 2 weeks prior to this event, the patient was functionally independent with a performance status of ECOG 1, but recently displayed increasing confusion, unsteady balance, numerous falls, and sometimes difficulty with speech. There was no significant tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use history. His past medical history was significant for peripheral neuropathy affecting his feet, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He was diagnosed with gastric cancer 11 months prior by stomach wall biopsy demonstrating poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. Staging CT scans showed metastases to the omentum, retroperitoneum, diaphragmatic lymph nodes, and malignant ascites. He initially began standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with a partial response which lasted for several months. Six months later, he was switched to capecitabine due to disease progression, which was poorly tolerated and discontinued after 1 cycle. Subsequently he received ramucirumab single-agent therapy at the dose of 8 mg/kg given intravenously. He received four doses, each spaced 2 weeks apart, with the last dose 2 weeks prior to presentation.\nHis physical exam was significant for orientation to person only and ataxia on the finger-nose-finger test. Initial laboratory results were within normal limits except for creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, BUN 30 mg/dl, and TSH 14.24 mIU/l with normal T4 1.2 ng/dl. Cardiac telemetry did not show any evidence of arrhythmia. CT of the head did not show any acute changes to explain the patient's symptoms. Carotid Doppler ultrasound was negative for significant stenosis. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for thrombus or severe atrial dilation; it did note a patent foramen ovale with a very small amount of right-to-left shunting. MRI with gadolinium of the brain revealed multifocal mildly increased diffusion signals with a corresponding increased T2 and FLAIR signal, likely subacute, involving the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral occipital lobes, and bilateral parietal cortex (fig. ), confirming multifocal ischemic stroke, while in the hospital the patient underwent physical and occupational therapy and did achieve improvement in his symptoms. However, due to his poor prognosis and overall decline in functional status it was decided by the patient and his family to be discharged home with hospice. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

None of his family members had a known history of diabetes. He complained of a warm and painful lesion on his thigh for the last three weeks, but reported no recent history of trauma or injection. Initial physical examination of the painful lesion revealed tenderness and non-pitting edema of the anteromedial right thigh. His blood pressure and body temperature were 120/80 mmHg and 36.4℃, respectively. There was no leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 9,190/µL) and C-reactive protein was normal, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 62 mm/hr. His glycemic control was very poor, with an HbA1c 14.5% and postprandial glucose of 446 mg/dL. Other biochemistry values were as follows: serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, potassium 4.6 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 86 U/L, albumin 4.1 g/dL, and creatinine kinase 436 mg/dL. He had proteinuria (trace) and glycosuria (4+) on urinalysis.\nSerial blood culture showed no evidence of bacterial infection. As infectious causes were thought to be less likely, we conducted arterial and venous doppler ultrasonography of the extremity to exclude vascular problems such as deep vein thrombosis or peripheral artery disease. There was no evidence of vascular structural abnormality, but an ill-defined hyperechoic lesion and thick fluid collection in the right vastus medialis muscle was found. After four days, the amount of fluid increased, and thus fluid aspiration at the intermuscular fascial plane adjacent to the vastus lateralis was done (). The fluid was clear, watery and serous. Gram stain and culture of the fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right thigh reflected diffuse edema around the vastus medialis with low signal intensity on T1 () and high signal intensity on T2 images (). The three-phase bone scan showed increased blood flow to the right thigh consistent with myonecrosis as shown on the thigh MRI (). The bone scan also revealed increased blood flow at the right medial tibial condyle consistent with an insufficiency fracture, which was subsequently confirmed by X-ray and MRI (). Since these clinical findings and images were highly suggestive of DMI of the right vastus medialis with insufficient fracture of the right tibial condyle, a muscle biopsy was not performed.\nDue to the early onset of disease (age 27), no obesity and no family history of T2D, we needed to clearly identify the exact type of his diabetes. Baseline C-peptide level was very low (0.1 ng/mL) and did not sufficiently rise at 6 min after glucagon stimulation test (0.3 ng/mL). Antinuclear antibodies, and anti-IA2 antibody results were not significant, but antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD Ab) were positive (2.0 U/mL). Other immunologic factors were negative. Considering his age, low BMI, positive anti-GAD Ab, and severely decreased C-peptide level, we diagnosed his diabetes as a case of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). After we examined microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications, he was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and non-proliferative retinopathy of both eyes as well as microalbuminuria based on spot urine analysis (152 µg/mg Creatinine).\nWhen we evaluated the cause of the insufficiency fracture, we found that his bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced, with T-scores of -3.9 (Z-score -3.3) at L1-L4 and -2.7 (Z-score -2.3) at the femur neck. Due to the young age of the patient, we also evaluated possible etiologies of secondary osteoporosis, including hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, and glucocorticoid excess. 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-[OH]D) level was also lower than the normal limits (<4 ng/mL, normal range 11.1 to 42.9) and osteocalcin level was slightly decreased (2.4 ng/mL, normal range 2.7 to 11.5). Thyroid function test was normal (free-T4 0.90 ng/dL, normal range 0.77 to 1.94 ng/dL; Thyroid stimulating hormone 2.24 µU/mL, normal range 0.30 to 4.00 µU/mL; T3 120 ng/dL, normal range 80 to 200 ng/dL), and there was no significant finding of thyroid autoantibodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 19.6 pg/mL (normal range 13 to 54 pg/mL). C-telopeptide level was within normal limits (0.74 ng/mL, normal range 0.07 to 0.78 ng/mL). Testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were also within normal limits (Testosterone 2.19 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 8.96 ng/mL; FSH 4.0 ng/mL, normal range, 2.8 to 9.6 ng/mL), with a slightly low luteinizing hormone level (1.3 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 5.2 ng/mL).\nAntibiotics were initially prescribed, but discontinued when bacterial infection was ruled out and DMI was thought to be the most likely clinical diagnosis. Instead, the patient was treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen, application of a long leg splint and bed rest, and multiple daily injections of insulin for strict glucose control. For his osteoporotic fracture, he was administered oral vitamin D and calcium agents. After about two weeks of supportive management, the tenderness and swelling of the right anteromedial thigh gradually reduced and the patient was able to walk without help, and so the splint was removed. 3 months later, when the hyperglycemia was controlled, we have done the oral glucose tolerance test and calculated the insulinogenic index (IGI, delta insulin 30 min-0 min/delta glucose 30 min-0 min). Calculated IGI was 0 (reference range >0.5), which reflects diminished beta-cell function on glucose stimulation. On follow-up ultrasonography after 6 months, the myonecrosis of the right vastus medialis muscle was dramatically resolved and his HbA1c had improved to 5.7%. In addition, his 25-(OH)D level had risen to 58.7 ng/mL after 6 months of treatment. Five months after treatment, the patient complained of frequent injections, so we changed his insulin regimen to a premixed combination insulin injection twice a day. He is currently under follow-up at the outpatient clinic without any evidence of recurrence. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 38-year-old Caucasian woman was diagnosed with a left-sided neck nodule six months after undergoing RYGB to treat obesity. She recalled palpating a vague mass on the cervical site before her RYGB, but this mass became more pronounced only after she lost 33kg. (Her body mass index (BMI) had changed from 43.5kg/m2 to 30.5kg/m2). She reported a past history (prior to her RYGB) of a right lobectomy of the thyroid to treat a benign nodule, as well as hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Before undergoing the second thyroid surgery and during her first visit at our clinic, she brought laboratory results showing normal levels of calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), PTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\nTo investigate the cervical mass, a thyroid ultrasound was performed. The scan showed a 3.1×2.2×2.0cm hypoechoic nodule on the left lobe. Subsequently an aspirative biopsy was obtained. Cytopathology suggested a Hurthle cell lesion. Total thyroidectomy was indicated and hence carried out, and the diagnosis of Hurthle cell adenoma was confirmed. Immediately after surgery, the patient had hypocalcemia and required an intravenous calcium gluconate infusion to stabilize her calcemia. All of the laboratory data obtained during clinical management are provided in Table .\nTwo months after her total thyroidectomy, she was referred to our unit’s care center by the surgeons because of difficulties in the clinical management of hypoparathyroidism. Meanwhile, she was admitted several times to an emergency room to reverse hypocalcemia with intravenous calcium infusions. During her visit at our unit, she reported paresthesias, muscle cramps and tingling in the mouth. A physical examination revealed that she had positive Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs. Her serum calcium and phosphorus levels were 5.9mg/dl and 7.1mg/dl, respectively. Her TSH level was 16.6μUI/ml. She was being treated with levothyroxine 100μg/day, calcium carbonate 7.5g/day, oral calcitriol 2.0μg twice daily and a multivitamin tablet. Doses of levothyroxine and calcium carbonate were increased to 150μg/day and 12g/day, respectively, and magnesium oxide 400mg tablet three times per day was added. Strict instructions about sunlight exposure (20min/day) and diet were given. All these measures improved her calcium homeostasis and avoided any further hospitalization. At her three-month follow-up examination, it was discovered that her calcium level had increased and her phosphorus level had decreased (see Table ). She had a low PTH level and a normal TSH level. Her magnesium and albumin levels and renal and hepatic function were within normal ranges (NRs). We decided to change calcium carbonate to citrate (12g/day) and to add cholecalciferol (12,000IU/day).\nOne month later, her symptoms were partially improved, and she reported that our advice about sunlight exposure was not being completely followed. Minimal changes in laboratory data were noticed, and her urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was 0.09 (NR<0.20). Because of the large amount of tablets/pills needed for daily intake at that time, we speculated that she could be a candidate for surgical reversal of the bariatric procedure; however, she definitively rejected it, fearing weight regain. Facing this challenge, and without financial resources to cope with synthetic PTH hormone treatment, we hypothesized that the use of pancrelipase could improve fat absorption at the alimentary tract with possible positive effects on vitamin D absorption and subsequently on calcium homeostasis. To test our hypothesis, pancrelipase was added at mealtime (three times per day) (compound capsule containing 10,000 USP units of lipase, 37,500 USP units of protease and 33,200 USP units of amylase). After continuous use of pancrelipase without side effects, her symptoms gradually improved until she became totally asymptomatic. Two months later, she had serum calcium and phosphorus levels of 7.2mg/dl and 5.0mg/dl, respectively. We increased her calcium citrate dosage to 14g/day. After two months, her levels of calcium, phosphorus and 25(OH)D were 7.8mg/dl, 5.2mg/dl and 67.9μg/L, respectively. At that time, her calciuria was 62.6mg/24h (NR, 50mg/24h to 250mg/24h), and her phosphaturia was 405mg/24h (NR, 340mg/24h to 1300mg/24h). Calcitriol was subsequently reduced to 1.5μg three times daily.\nHer symptoms had completely remitted at 10 months after thyroidectomy. Her levels of calcium were within, and eventually slightly below, the NR. She became pregnant, and, during the second trimester, although asymptomatic, she had hypocalcemia with normal levels of phosphorus and 25(OH)D (Table , 14 months). Calcium citrate was increased to 18g/day, which stabilized calcium homeostasis from the sixth month of pregnancy until delivery. She gave birth to a healthy newborn at term and breastfed her baby during the first six months. At present, her symptoms have remitted and her calcium, phosphorus and 25(OH)D levels are within NR. However, she still ingests an excessive daily number of tablets and/or pills (a total of 45/day).

    "problem": "<Context> A 50-year-old, 50-kg, 152-cm man with aortic and mitral valvular disease was scheduled for a double valve replacement. He had been diagnosed with Hunter syndrome at the age of 40 years and had received enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase infusion. He had undergone general anesthesia 3 months previously for cervical laminoplasty at another hospital, and his airway had been managed uneventfully at that time with a reinforced tracheal tube of 7-mm inner diameter (ID). He showed the distinctive features of a short neck, jaw deformation, and macroglossia, and he had slight cervical motor restriction and a Mallampati classification of Ш. Preoperative flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy 2 week previously showed that the patency of the upper respiratory tract was kept though oropharyngeal soft tissue thickening was recognized. However, chest computed tomography (CT) 1.5 months previously showed tracheal stenosis that had flattened the lumen (). The narrowest part above the tracheal bifurcation was 2 cm long and the anteroposterior diameter was ≤6 mm, but the patency of the upper part of the trachea was adequate for insertion of a tracheal tube of 7-mm ID. Cardiac ultrasound demonstrated severe aortic valve stenosis, moderate aortic valve regurgitation, and mild mitral valve regurgitation. The aortic valve area was 0.53 cm2. The maximum and mean aortic valve pressure gradients were 106 and 67 mmHg, respectively. The left ventricle was generally enlarged and the ejection fraction was 71% (Simpson's method). Abdominal CT showed hepatosplenomegaly. All blood parameters were within the normal ranges. During a preoperative conference, we assessed that his airway could be managed in the same way as during the previous anesthetic procedure because the patient had not felt difficulty in breathing.\nAt the time of admission, his blood pressure was 139/47 mmHg, heart rate was 65 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation was 97%. After cannulation to the left radial artery for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure, 3 mg of midazolam and 200 μg of fentanyl were administered for induction of anesthesia. After confirming mask ventilation, 60 mg of rocuronium bromide was provided for neuromuscular blockade. The glottis was easily confirmed using the Airway Scope (Pentax-AWS®; Hoya, Tokyo, Japan), and a tracheal tube of 7-mm ID was inserted into the trachea. However, the tube could not be advanced more than 3 cm from the glottis. The tube was removed. The upper airway was then secured using an i-gel #4 (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and bronchoscopic examination was performed through the breathing channel of the i-gel. Tracheal stenosis that gradually became more severe from under the glottis was revealed (). Therefore, a tracheal tube of 6-mm ID was inserted using the Airway Scope. We felt slight resistance during insertion of the tube, but an audible leak around the tube with an inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O was heard when the cuff was deflated. The tube was secured at the 22-cm mark at the alveolar ridge. Pressure-controlled ventilation was started with a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, and a tidal volume of about 450 ml was obtained. Although a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted, the tidal volume did not change.\nThe aortic and mitral valve replacement was uneventfully performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. After aortic declamping, the patient was easily weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with a 5-μg/kg/min dopamine infusion. Cardiac function after weaning was good. However, the tidal volume suddenly decreased from 450 to 120 ml at sternal closure, and the end-expiratory carbon dioxide pressure increased from 39 to 71 mmHg. Bronchoscopic examination showed that the stenosis became more severe than that after induction of anesthesia, and the part of the tracheal bifurcation was almost occluded. The tidal volume was hardly obtained in spite of a peak inspiratory pressure of >30 cmH2O. Therefore, we tried to remove the TEE probe because it might have been exacerbating the tracheal stenosis by pushing the trachea adjacent to the esophagus. As a result, a tidal volume of 400 ml was obtained with a peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O by improving the severe stenosis of the tracheal bifurcation, and the end-expiratory carbon dioxide pressure decreased to 43 mmHg. In addition, 125 mg of methylprednisolone was administered intravenously to reduce edema in the lower respiratory tract. Extubation was performed on the second postoperative day. After extubation, the patient's oxygenation was good but wheezing and dyspnea were noted. Procaterol inhalation and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation were administered for 3 days. After his breathing had become stable, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 25th postoperative day. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

On physical examination, left ankle dorsiflextion was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbosacral vertebral column showed a left paramedian disc extrusion, between lumbar 4 and 5 vertebras. The patient was scheduled for discectomy. In premedical history, the patient complained of dysarthria, dysphagia and weakness in both legs, while walking 3 years ago. He also complained of dyspnea, although, there were no abnormalities on the blood gas analysis. On the physical findings by a neurologist, deep tendon reflex was exacerbated and babinski test was positive. The electromyogram (EMG) suggested that the patient had a motor neuron disease and he was diagnosed with ALS. Pulmoary function test was not performed before the operation, due to the undergoing emergency operation for resolution of severe pain on the left leg.\nSpinal anesthesia for discectomy was chosen to avoid respiratory complication, which is associated with general anesthesia. No preanesthetic medication was given. Spinal anesthesia was done between lumbar 3 and 4, via a midline approach in the left lateral position and was injected with 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, plus fentanyl 20 µg using a 25 guage Quinke spinal needle. Immediately after the injection of local anesthetic agent and opioid, the patient was placed back to the supine position. The level of the spinal anesthesia was T10, after 15 minutes and then we changed the patient's position from supine to prone position. Propofol at a rate of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/hr was infused for sedation with O2 5 L/min via nasal cannula.

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and renal ultrasonography (USG KUB) were also normal except for mild left hydronephrosis. 60 MBq of Tc-99m DMSA was administered IV after adequate hydration and the scintigraphy was performed 3 hours later. The anterior and posterior images showed no definite delineation of renal cortical outline with high background tracer activity and hence pinhole images could not be acquired []. The child had no recent history of UTI to suggest any recent acute renal insult. A detailed enquiry then revealed that the child is a suspected case of Lowe's syndrome and had bilateral cataracts operated in his first year of age, history of global developmental delay and abnormal behavioral pattern. Biochemical analysis revealed hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) and alkaline urine with associated hyperphosphaturia, hypercalciuria, nonselective aminoaciduria, and glycosuria indicative of Fanconi type of proximal renal tubular acidosis. Suspecting the proximal tubular disorder as the cause of the discrepancy, an EC renal dynamic study was performed.

Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

He had undergone aortic bioprosthesis replacement due to infective endocarditis and single vessel coronary by-pass for second obtuse marginal artery stenosis eight months ago. The initial examination identified ongoing anginal chest pain along the mid-sternal region for two and half hours. His blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and his pulse was 70 beats/min. His cardiac troponin T blood levels were higher than normal. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and underwent emergency coronary angiography. During the coronary angiography, severe stenosis was detected in the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the left anterior descending (LAD), and the left circumflex (CX) arteries (). We intended to perform coronary revascularization via a percutaneous coronary intervention. However, immediately after this procedure, we realized that there was a pulsatile variability in the severity of the coronary stenosis () and a silhouette of a round-shaped mass under the aortic valve. Left ventriculography revealed an LVOT pseudoaneurysm ( and ). Then, we selectively imaged the LVOT pseudoaneurysm ( and ) to evaluate its suitability for percutaneous closure. The patient immediately underwent computed tomography (CT), which clearly revealed the nature of the pseudoaneurysm and its compressive effect on the LMCA, LAD, and CX ().

Routine urinalysis revealed no proteinuria or hematuria. Complement levels were normal range and autoantibodies (Antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) were negative. Chest PA showed no cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema, and Kidney-Ureter-Bladder radiography (KUB) was non-specific. Kidney ultrasonography revealed diffusely increased echogenicity and kidney size was smaller than normal (8.2 × 5.0 cm). The abdominal computed tomography showed no evidence of stone in both kidneys ().\nDue to uremic symptoms, emergency hemodialysis was started and the kidney biopsy was performed to identify the cause of ESRD. The kidney biopsy showed foci of tubular damage with deposition of translucent crystals of different shapes which are predominantly intraluminal, and confirmed these crystals as calcium oxalate crystals using polarized light (). Final report of pathology was chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystal deposits and a change of ESRD.\nHe was an office worker. He received regular national health examination including renal function and urinalysis, and both results were normal until two years before admission. His height and body weight were 167 cm and 70 kg. Body mass index was 25 kg/m2. Review of medical history revealed no history of kidney stone, diabetes, hypertension and operation. He had no medical family history. From the drug history, he had taken Chaga mushroom powder for 5 years due to atopic dermatitis. Initially, he had taken 3 g daily for 4 years following company's recommendation and 9 g of powder for another year because his symptom did not improve.\nBased on pathologic finding (oxalate nephropathy) and drug history (long-term exposure to Chaga mushroom), we suspected the association between Chaga mushroom and oxalate nephropathy in our case. Thus, we requested oxalate content of remained Chaga mushroom to researcher/clinical pharmacology division of Catholic Medical center clinical research coordinating center of Korea. Measurement of oxalate was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analysis revealed extremely high content of oxalate in Chaga mushroom powder (0.14 g of oxalate per 1 g of Chaga mushroom powder).\nWe finally diagnosed this case as Chaga mushroom-induced oxalate nephropathy with kidney biopsy findings, drug history and high content of oxalate. Clinical course of our case was unfavorable. Renal function has not recovered and he is on maintenance hemodialysis for 18 months.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Korea (IRB No. 2019-3713-0001) and an informed consent was received from the patient and a caregiver.

She requested labor analgesia.\nThe combined spinal-epidural block was placed at L3-L4 level, and 1.5 mg 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine with fentanyl 15 mcg was administered into the subarachnoid space. A catheter was introduced into the epidural space at cervix dilatation of 4 cm. Then, the labor analgesia was managed by programmed intermittent epidural bolus with 0.1% ropivacaine and fentanyl 2 mcg/mL was set at 8 mL with a 60-min interval. Due to polyhydramnios, pinhole amniotomy was performed at cervix dilation of 3 cm. There were no major complications until fetal bradycardia (80–90 beats per minute) occurred, which prompted the obstetric physician to go for vacuum extraction delivery. Patient delivered a female infant weighing 2468 g with an Apgar score of 7/8. Total delivery time was 2 h and 39 min (second stage of labor duration was 22 min).\nAfter an episiotomy, a large amount of bleeding from the uterus was observed, and the obstetric physician suspected it as postpartum atony. Blood pressure was 112/89 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats per minute, shock index was 1, and total amount of bleeding was 2800 mL at that time. We started to transfuse red blood cells and placed an intrauterine (Bakri®) balloon. At 30 min after the delivery, the total bleeding amount reached 3100 mL, and the blood pressure was decreased to 72/43 mmHg, shock index increased to 2, and SpO2 decreased to 86%. We started treatment based on a suspicious diagnosis of AFE due to sudden decrease of plasma fibrinogen level and uncontrollable bleeding from a needle hole. She was orotracheally intubated, and a central venous and a radial artery catheter was inserted. We ruled out pulmonary embolism because the central venous pressure was 5 mmHg. Besides administering low-dose noradrenaline, an occlusion balloon was inserted into the descending aorta. Uterine artery embolization was performed at radiology department. Red blood concentrates (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were transfused using a rapid infusion system. In spite of those treatments, her bleeding was uncontrollable and obstetrics team decided to perform total hysterectomy, and the patient was transferred to the operating room. The time from the start of surgery to hysterectomy was 11 min. The fibrinogen level increased above 100 mg/dL after hysterectomy. However, the second interventional radiology (IVR) was required to control bleeding from the vagina. Embolization of the right internal pudendal artery and cervicovaginal branches of the right uterine artery was performed. At last, her bleeding was controlled, and the blood pressure became stable without norepinephrine administration. After hysterectomy, she was transferred to the ICU with intubation. The total bleeding amount was 12,000 mL, and the total amount of RBCs, FFP, platelet concentrate, and fibrinogen required were 38 U, 36 U, 60 U, and 8 V, respectively. The perioperative chart is shown in Fig. . The time series results of blood sampling are shown in Table .\nShe was extubated on the second day after surgery at ICU. On the third day, she was moved from the ICU to the general ward. On the 16th postoperative day, she was discharged from the hospital without any complications. Laboratory tests at when postpartum hemorrhage began showed that serum zinc coproporphyrin-1 and sialyl-Tn antigens were negative, but C3 (64.0 mg/dL), C4 component (10.0 mg/dL), and C1 esterase inhibitor levels (27%) were low.

    "problem": "<Context> A 25-year-old man was referred to vascular medicine clinic because of pain in the left calf while running, which had been occurring for the past 4 years.\nThis patient practiced almost daily physical activity that involved both combative and running (over 8 h per week), and he competed at a regional level (with a personal best of running of 36min12s/10000 m). In 2012, the patient had reported left calf pain when running, forcing him to stop. He described a calf swelling sensation that gradually increased with the intensity of running. While in the past he could easily run 15–20 km, the patient reported at that date that he could not run more than 2 km before having to stop. After stopping, the pain was deep and persisted for several minutes; it was also associated with swelling of the calf. This pain had led him to change his occupation to a less physically demanding job (military officer in the past, and now security officer). The consequences were a weight gain of 8 kg, and a cessation of all physical activity (running, fight sports). The patient also reported a loss of self-esteem.\nOver a period of 4 years, the patient was seen by two general physicians, a rheumatologist, a neurologist, a sports physician and a vascular physician. Many explorations were carried out (spinal and pelvic x-ray, pelvic and lumbar spine scan, venous duplex scan, arterial duplex scan, and electromyography), all of which revealed no sign of dysfunction. The sports physician raised the possibility of diagnosis of a compartment syndrome, but the patient refused to submit to investigation of intramuscular pressure taken at rest and in immediately post exercise. Different therapies were proposed, including anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol and compression stockings (Class 2).\nThe patient interview revealed that a proximal deep vein thrombosis DVT (thrombosis in the iliac, femoral and popliteal veins) of the left lower limb had been diagnosed in 2012 and treated for 6 months by direct oral anticoagulant therapy (Rivaroxaban, Xarelto 20 mg per day) combined with compression stockings french class 3 worn (20–36 mmHg) for 6 months and then class 2 compression socks (15–20 mmHg) thereafter. This episode of DVT occurred spontaneously without major or minor contributing factors. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism disease. Clinical and laboratory tests had found no neoplasia. The biological thrombophilia test at distance of anticoagulation was negative.\nThe patient was 1.78 m and 79 kg (body mass index = 24.9 kg/m2). He was afebrile, and his brachial blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg. Upon examination the legs were hot and there was no trophic disorder. There was a difference in the circumference of the calves (left calf 2 cm > right calf). There were no visible or palpable varicose veins. Peripheral pulses were present and there was no sign of Lassegue. Palpation of the major lower limb joints (ankles, knees, hips) was not painful. Calves were flexible, painless, with good trophicity. No lymphadenopathy was found and no local inflammatory signs. When examined by auscultation, there were no vascular sounds along the vascular axes.\nAll Doppler ultrasound measurements were performed with a high-resolution ultrasound machine (Affiniti 70, Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The deep venous system was free and compressible when compressed by the ultrasound probe at calf level (posterior tibial veins, peroneal, gastrocnemius and soleus), at femoral popliteal level (popliteal veins, femoral and common femoral) and at ilio-cava level with no sign of recent deep vein thrombosis. There was wall thickening at the left common femoral vein CFV (anterior posterior diameter APD under compression = 3.9 mm) and at the left external iliac vein (APD under compression = 3.6 mm); this finding had already been highlighted when vascular physician examined the patient in 2013.\nThe Doppler examination showed a clear asymmetry of the respiratory modulations of blood velocity between right and left CFV. In the left CVT, respiratory modulations were almost absent and blood volume flow was not as high as on the right side. We found a reflux into the left internal iliac vein and dilation of the left gonadal vein. While standing, there was no significant deep venous reflux (> 1 s) at the popliteal vein (functional venous valves). The superficial venous system (great and small saphenous veins) was compressible and continent.\nThe diagnostic hypothesis of MTS was issued at the end of this first consultation, taking into account the following clinical and hemodynamic arguments:▪ History of the left proximal DVT without predisposing factor. ▪ Symptoms of left calf venous claudication due to effort (+/− associated with unilateral edema reported by the patient). ▪ Asymmetry respiratory modulation and venous blood volume flow at the left proximal deep vein (as a result of a downstream obstacle).\nAdditional morphological exploration was requested computed tomography angiography (CTA) and a surgical opinion was recommended and requested.\nThe CTA revealed compression of the left common iliac vein (CIV) between the right common iliac artery (CIA) and lumbar spine (Fig. ) and intraluminal spurs. There was also dissimilar venous systems collatorally with that was more highly developed on the left iliac axis relative to the right iliac axis, reflecting the need to create a system of substitution.\nIn this context of symptomatic MTS with compatible imaging, venography was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis and to treat the MTS at the same time. Venography showed patency of the left venous axis iliac featuring endoluminal spurs and a footprint at the terminal portion of the iliac vein (Fig. ).\nEndovascular support was carried out with introduction of two Wallstent endo prostheses (Boston Scientific) into the common iliac and external iliac veins, associated with angioplasty intra stent to modulate the different areas of overlap, the diameters and lengths to achieve a harmonious assembly. The phlebographic control carried out at the end of the procedure was satisfactory.\nAt 3 and 6 months, the patient reported an improvement in symptoms. The patient restarted running, and initially venous claudication was not felt and the patient was once more able to run more than 10 km. He currently wears a compression class III especially during physical activity, as advised.\nAngiographic assessment found normal stent patency at the iliac vein, with symmetrical respiratory modulations. It was also decided to carry out a duplex ultrasound scan at 3 months. At this scanning session the stents were in place and permeable. Pharmacological treatment in the form of an anti platelet (Clopidogrel 75 mg) was prescribed. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

One month after cesarean section due to prolonged labor, she noticed the development of loose, wrinkled skin of abdomen without any sign of inflammation. The patient was treated by her gynaecologist with topical emollients, but with no result. At that time, patient refused reconstructive surgery of the redundant abdominal skin and had second cesarean section 3 years ago due to prolonged labor.\nOn admission to our Hospital her height was 175 centimeters and weight was 60 kilograms, body mass index was normal (19,6). Lax, redundant folds in the lower part of the abdominal wall were not associated with papules or plaques and were on non-sun-exposed areas.The affected area has normal pigmentation and no associated scaling. There was a lack of cutaneous induration or sclerosis. Skin lesions were asymptomatic and lack clinical sings of inflammation. Loss of recoil due to impaired function of the elastic fiber network has led to pendulous skin which was most notable in abdomen. These findings were limited to the skin of abdomen and were primarily of major cosmetic concern to patient. Extracutaneous findings were absent. She had had no previous illnesses and without any subjective difficulties (e.g., pain, fever, weight loss). There was no family history of this disorder and skin lesions were not present at birth and developed during 2nd decade of life. There was no mucosal involvement. She was not taking any medication. History of chronic sun exposure was negative. She was non-smoker.\nCL has been diagnosed based on the clinical picture and pathohistological appearance. On admission excisional biopsy of lax skin has been performed. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining has revealed normal collagen fibers, without any inflammatory infiltrate. Histopathologic analysis of skin has shown characteristic histologic feature of CL such as a loss of dermal elastic fibers revealed by orcein stain. Diminished elastic tissue was revealed throughout the dermis, not extending into the subcutis. The remaining elastic fibers were disorganized, shortened and fragmented. There was no epidermal alterations or cellular infiltrate ().\nThere was no evidence of IgG and IgA deposits in lesional skin.The following diagnostic and laboratory tests have been performed during hospitalization. Obtained findings include the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood count with differential and platelet count—values were within normal limits. The following tests were normal as well (glucose, transaminases, electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, C3, C4, ANA, bilirubin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, iron, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, urine analysis). Other laboratory findings were also regular (pharyngeal and nasal swabs, oral cavity mycological analysis, PPD, hemoccult test). A basic laboratory assessment of clotting was performed including a platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Obtained echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were without significant changes. There were no radiological signs for pulmonary emphysema. Serum level of α\n1-antitrypsin and tumor markers (CA 19-9, CEA, CA 125, CA 15-3, and CYFRA 21-1) was normal as well. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was normal. Additional laboratory findings include free T3 and free T4 levels, and antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies.

The patient, who initially only had indefinite tiredness at the end of the match, ended up developing burning chest pain early in the training.\nUpon physical examination, the patient was well overall, eupneic at ambient air, normal color, acyanotic, feverless and anicteric.\nThe patient weighed 79 kg; 1.79 m tall; with a heart rate of 60bpm; and blood pressure (BP) at 120/80 mmHg.\nChest examination showed an apical thrust and normal heart and lung sounds.\nPulses were symmetrical with normal amplitudes and there was no peripheral edema. Laboratory tests within normal limits.\nResting ECG evidenced ARV with anterior septum T-wave inversion ().\nFollowing the investigation, he underwent ergospirometric testing that showed no arrhythmias or electrocardiographic changes for myocardial ischemia, but there were symptoms of mild typical chest pain during the examination and abnormal findings concerning oxygen consumption (VO2) - 48.3mL/kg/min (the reference standard was 48.9); and the oxygen pulse was 21.1 ml 02/bpm (the reference standard was 19.9), with a plateau curve at the peak effort reached.\nHe then underwent transesophageal echocardiography, which showed normal wall thickness and dimensions, no septal defects and normal LV systo diastolic function, despite anteroapical hypokinesia.\nThe patient remained with anginal pain when an anatomical evaluation with CT angiography was necessary and showed proximal obstruction in the ADA which presented normal distal flow due to the receipt of collateral circulation in the right circumflex and coronary arteries.\nThe examination disregarded coronary atherosclerosis ( and ). Thrombophilias, rheumatological, inflammatory and connective tissue diseases were also investigated; with negative results.\nDue to the obstruction of the ADA, we investigated the repercussion of this lesion on ventricular function by myocardial scintigraphy, which showed transient hypocaptation in the anterior, apical and septal walls with great extent, reaching 28% of the LV.\nOnce the lesion was evidenced and its relevant repercussion was demonstrated, the patient was submitted to CATE, confirming the previous findings, in which the ADA TCA was performed with a pharmacological stent (Promus 4.0 × 2.8 mm), although the patient was aware of the possibility of distal embolization, resulting in a final TIMI 3 flow.\nAfter the procedure, the patient remained asymptomatic receiving daily ASA, prasugrel and continued cardiac rehabilitation.\nA control scintigraphy, after three months of CATE, demonstrated total reversal of myocardial ischemia.\nCurrently, the patient remains asymptomatic, performing outpatient follow-up, and practicing intense physical activity. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Her symptoms started one day prior to admission. The patient was also complaining of abdominal pain, however, there was no associated dysphagia, change in bowel habits, or bleeding from other sites. She did not have a history of GI bleeding nor was she taking aspirin or anti-coagulants.\nIn the ER, the patient was tachycardic and hypotensive, but afebrile. Her complete blood count (CBC) was significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.17 x 10(3)/uL, a slightly dropped hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL from her baseline of 11.6 g/dL, and a normal platelet count. The basic metabolic panel was only significant for hypocalcemia of 5.5 mg/dL with serum albumin of 2.2 gm/dL. Liver function test, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were all normal. She was given three units of packed red blood cells and was started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but given the recurrent hematemesis and decreased level of consciousness, she was intubated for airway protection and was placed on mechanical ventilation.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was done, which showed Los Angeles (LA) grade D esophagitis and a non-bleeding gastric ulcer. Moreover, the PEG tube balloon tip was displaced and trapped in the duodenal bulb causing GOO (Figure ) with resultant severe reflux esophagitis. The balloon tip was retracted to the gastric wall and fixed. The patient was continued on a PPI and was extubated the day after.

His vitals on presentation were a temperature of 98.4 F, blood pressure (BP) of 159/89 mmHg, pulse rate of 72/minute, respiratory rate of 22/minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He did not report any significant family history of coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies. His blood troponin levels were within normal limits and he did not have any new changes on his ECG. He was admitted to the hospital and an echocardiogram was done which showed normal left ventricular function with trace valvular insufficiencies and mildly dilated aortic root (). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was ruled out and the patient was referred for an outpatient exercise stress echocardiogram, which showed no evidence of ischemia. There were no changes to his medication regimen during this encounter.\nSix months later, he called emergency medical services (EMS) with episodes of stabbing chest pain associated with shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and dizziness. The patient was found to be in VF arrest en-route and was defibrillated by the EMS. On arrival, his mental status returned to baseline and the patient was conversant. His vital signs were within normal limits, and an ECG showed normal sinus rhythm but his blood work revealed elevated troponin levels that peaked at 11.74 ng/ml. An emergency cardiac catheterization was done which did not show any evidence of obstructive lesions, or focal or diffuse vascular spasms except for mild right coronary artery plaque. A computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of his chest did not show aortic aneurysm or dissection. He had frequent episodes of non–sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry as an inpatient (). A single chamber implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) was placed with settings at ventricular tachycardia (VT) monitor zone 160 and VFib zone 200 for secondary prevention of VF. He was discharged on diltiazem 180 mg daily and isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg daily.\nAbout one month later, he again presented to the hospital with spontaneous ICD shock following an episode of transient chest pain at rest, with no notable precipitating factors. An interrogation of his ICD was done which revealed VF episodes that led to ICD firing. Subsequently, he was started on sotalol and his diltiazem was switched to amlodipine 5 mg. His ICD was reprogrammed after evaluation by an electrophysiologist.\nSeven months after discharge, the patient came to the emergency department complaining of sudden substernal chest discomfort, which he rated at 10 out of 10 in intensity. His vital signs on presentation were temperature of 98.6 F, BP 166/93 mmHg, pulse rate of 69/min, respiratory rate of 48/min, and an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. His chest discomfort improved with sublingual nitroglycerine and morphine. An ECG revealed ST elevations in lead I and aVL with reciprocal ST–T wave changes in inferior leads (). He underwent emergency cardiac catheterization with concerns for ACS, which revealed no focal coronary spasms, and non–occlusive disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 50–55% and mild hypokinesia in the anterolateral wall. His labs showed an elevated troponin level of 2.58 ng/ml (normal <0.03). A complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, serum electrolytes, and lipid panel were all within normal limits. A repeat ECG showed resolution of prior ECG changes (). The patient was discharged on aspirin 81 mg once a day, atorvastatin 40 mg once a day, increased amlodipine to 10 mg, sotalol 120 mg twice a day, and nitroglycerin 0.4 mg as needed for chest pain. Of note is his Imdur had been stopped a few days prior to his presentation as he had not had any recurrent` chest pain and had started using sildenafil citrate as needed for erectile dysfunction.\nOn follow up, the patient has not had any more hospitalization or further episodes of chest pain or ICD shocks on the current medication regimen. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

Physical examination revealed a cachectic and frail man, with epigastric abdominal tenderness and voluntary guarding. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 102/63 mmHg, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, temperature of 36.9°C, oxygen saturation of 99% at room air, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Initial laboratory studies revealed an elevated lipase of 1671 U/L (10-140 U/L) and leukocytosis of 17.1 × 103/uL (4.0-10.5 × 103/uL) with a 75% neutrophilic predominance. A chest radiograph revealed a large right-sided apical cavitary lesion measuring up to 6 cm (Figure ).\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast was obtained to further characterize the findings evident on the chest radiograph which revealed a cavitary lesion with internal dependent debris and air-fluid level in the right upper lobe apical and anterior segment measuring 5.7 × 5.7 × 5.8 cm (Figure ).\nThe patient was started on aggressive IV fluid hydration with Ringer’s Lactate for the treatment of pancreatitis as well as IV piperacillin-tazobactam to cover for the possibility of bacterial cavitary pneumonia.\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and fungal culture grew A. flavus with fungal smear revealing septate hyphae branching at 45-degree angles. A. flavus titers were elevated at 1:4, for which a diagnosis of CCPA was made. HIV testing was negative. Antifungal therapy with voriconazole 200 mg PO BID was initiated. Piperacillin-tazobactam was discontinued as the BAL cultures were negative for bacteria. BAL acid-fast bacilli culture grew M. avium intracellulare and the patient was started on ethambutol 800 mg PO QD, azithromycin 500 mg PO BID, and amikacin 250 mg IV BID.\nThe patient clinically improved with decreased oxygen requirement and down-trending white blood cell counts and was discharged from the hospital on voriconazole, ethambutol, azithromycin, and IV amikacin.\nThe patient returned to the emergency department at our institution with shortness of breath less than a week after being discharged. At this time, he had an oxygen saturation of 92% at room air, which improved to 97% with a 3 L nasal cannula. A chest radiograph showed evidence of a new right-sided spontaneous pneumothorax (Figure ), which was also demonstrated on CT chest with IV contrast (Figure ).\nA right-sided chest tube was placed for the treatment of the right-sided pneumothorax (Figure ).\nDaily chest radiographs were obtained to monitor the status of the pneumothorax. It continued to enlarge secondary to subsequent malpositioning of the chest tube. At this time, interventional radiology was consulted. A pigtail catheter was placed and the malpositioned chest tube was removed (Figure ).\nFollowing pigtail catheter placement, the pneumothorax resolved within a week, and the catheter was removed without complications. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated the resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient’s oxygen saturation improved to 98% on room air.\nAmikacin was changed from IV administration to the inhaled formulation to avoid nephrotoxicity on discharge.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 36.9 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 62.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 17100.0 count/µL. To convert 17100.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 17100.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 17100000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.

Simple and contrasted abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with focal lesions, the largest being 15 cm in segment VIII, and satellite lesions of up to 5.5 cm in segment VII and 3.5 cm in segment III, with similar morphologic characteristics. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a liver with no signs of chronic disease, and an infiltrative dominant lesion of 11 x 8 cm in segments IV and V, associated with smaller lesions in both lobules of 1.6 cm in segment III, and 0.9 cm in segments VII and VIII (Figure ). Subsequently, the patient presented aggressiveness and disorientation, where hypoglycemia was documented (33 mg/dL) and treated with dextrose 10% with complete symptom resolution.\nPhysical examination revealed cachectic facies, and an abdominal mass of approximately 13 cm located in epigastrium and right hypochondrium, associated with hepatomegaly.

Given our patient’s profile, a “big” IGF-II measurement was attempted, but the assay is not available in Colombia. Therefore, hypoglycemia due to tumor consumption vs paraneoplastic hypoglycemia due to “big”-IGF II production were the suspected diagnoses. The patient required treatment with 50% dextrose in continuous infusion to achieve normal blood glucose and to remain symptom free.\nA positron emission tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) was performed (Figure ), where multiple hypermetabolic hepatic masses were observed, in both hepatic lobules; the high uptake index suggested an elevated glucose consumption tumor. Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of trabecular and fibrolamellar hepatocarcinoma (Figure ). Given the size and presence of metastatic disease, the patient was not a candidate for surgical treatment; transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was done twice with partial improvement, but the dextrose infusion could not be stopped. A glucagon therapeutic test was performed, with inadequate response. Thereafter, an OctreoScan was performed (Figure ) to determine if the patient could benefit from somatostatin analogs, but uptake was observed in a pulmonary metastasis only, reducing success probability with such therapy.

The patient reported that her symptoms were similar to her previous episodes and were exacerbated by her menses, which she had recently completed four days prior to symptom onset. A review of systems did not reveal syncope, gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary symptoms, joint pain, rashes, diuretic/laxative abuse, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases. She endorsed smoking cannabis occasionally and denied tobacco or alcohol use. Aside from her potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate regimen, the patient was not on any psychotropic or other medications.\nExcept for bradycardia (heart rate of 50 bpm), her vital signs were within normal limits and physical examination was unremarkable. Results of initial lab tests showed sodium of 143 mmol/L, potassium of 2.1 mmol/L, chloride of 110 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 17 mmol/L. Venous blood gas pH was 7.21. Urine sodium was 74 mmol/L, urine potassium was 18.4 mmol/L, and urine chloride was 68 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed a urinary pH of 7.0 without blood or protein (Table ). The renal sonogram did not show nephrolithiasis. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, delayed intraventricular conduction, and U waves. With a positive urine anion gap of 24 and hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, she was diagnosed with distal RTA. She was promptly hydrated with intravenous normal saline and was given potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate, which corrected both her hypokalemia and hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was later discharged on oral potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate.\nOver the next few months, the patient had several similar presentations at hospitals for upper and lower extremity weakness and paralysis secondary to hypokalemia. Initially, exposure to synthetic cannabinoids was believed to have induced the patient’s severe hypokalemia and acid-base disturbances in the absence of known nephrotoxic drug exposure and autoimmune history. Additionally, suspicion of disordered eating/exercise or diuretic/laxative abuse as a contributor to her metabolic derangements was low based on patient report and chart review. On further probing, she admitted to infrequent, intermittent dry mouth and dry eyes with a sand-like sensation associated with ocular pruritus for several months, but denied any history of eye inflammation, use of artificial teardrops, or increased occurrence of cavities.\nHer autoimmune panel was positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (1:2560) and anti-Ro/SSA antibody (SSA-52: 261 AU/mL and SSA-60: 130 AU/mL) and negative for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), anti-Smith, anti-La/SSB, and anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies (Table ). Diagnostic tests for SCN4A deletion/duplication, urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, carnitine (total and free), acylcarnitine, and urine porphyrins were all within normal reference values. Given the patient did not have other derangements of urine and serum electrolytes, other causes of renal tubulopathies, such as Bartter, Gitelman, and Fanconi syndromes were subsequently ruled out. Based on sicca symptoms and positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, a presumptive diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome was made.

The hepatic parenchyma was forcefully pulled out to detach it from the hepatic vein stumps, which made stump walls long and thick. No venoplasty was applied to the recipient IVC orifice. The interposed funnel-shaped orifice of the graft hepatic vein was anastomosed with the recipient IVC orifice by 1 : 1 size matching (). The recipient portal vein was normal-looking, thus it was anastomosed with the graft portal vein stump using a branch patch (). The graft hepatic artery was reconstructed under surgical microscopy. Finally, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed.\nThe pathology report of the explant liver revealed enlarged hepatocytes with pale cytoplasm and halo nuclei, and multifocal aggregates of apoptotic cells, consistent with OTC (). Early follow-up computed tomography scan showed no vascular complications (). The patient recovered uneventfully from the LT operation. She had normal blood test findings including normal ammonia level. She has been doing well for six months after the transplantation. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

In the last 4 months, he had anorexia, asthenia, and difficulty to swallow any food. When he tried to eat, he felt nausea and sometimes vomited. He had lost 7 kg. He denied fever or other symptoms. He was an active smoker that had smoked 100 pack-years. He did not abuse alcohol or other drugs. He had arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus with HbA1c: 6.5% one month earlier and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had presented three no disabling ischemic strokes. He was taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, once a day; and captopril 50 mg TID. His father died of sudden death at 83 years old, and his mother died of stroke at 80 years old. His brother died of esophageal cancer with 55 years old. He lived with his wife. His physical examination revealed an alert, oriented man, with blood pressure: 120/70 mmHg; heart rate: 72 bpm; respiratory rate: 20 rpm; axillary temperature: 36°C; pulse oximetry: 95%; weight: 33.5 kg; height: 1.53 m; BMI: 14.3 kg/m2. There were several lymph nodes the cervical region, the larger one with 1.5 cm, and digital clubbing. Other aspects of his physical examination were normal. Two months before admission, chest radiography showed signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, micronodules and linear opacities in the upper lobes, and a small consolidation in the lower left lobe. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin = 8.6 g/dL (normal range: 13–14.2 g/dL); VCM = 88.9 fL (80–100 fL); leukocytes = 7220/μL (4000–10000/μL); neutrophils = 2758/μL (1800–7500/μL); eosinophils = 606/μL (40–500/μL); basophils = 87/μL (<100/μL); monocytes = 477/μL (120–1000/μL); lymphocytes = 3292/μL (1000–4000/μL); platelets: 409000/μL (150–400 × 103/μL); serum sodium: 134 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L); potassium: 5.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.1 mEq/L); creatinine: 0.64 mg/dL (0.5–1.2 mg/dL); ureic nitrogen: 21 mg/dL (5–20 mg/dL); calcium: 7.8 mg/dL (8.5–10.4 mg/dL); albumin: 3.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL); ALT: 17 U/L (<31U/L); glucose: 94/mg/dL (70–99 mg/dL). An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal, and a nasojejunal tube was inserted. The patient remained with the same symptoms, receiving food and liquids through a nasojejunal tube. In the sixth day after admission, after being submitted to chest and abdomen computerized tomography, he developed fever (39.5°C), confusion, blood pressure 160/110 mmHg, heart rate: 120 bpm, pulse oximetry: 95%. He received intravenous dipyrone. A few moments later, his blood pressure dropped to 80/40 mmHg, and intravenous saline solution was infused. A blood sample to measure serum ACTH and cortisol was drawn. In the next two days, he had no fever, and two samples of blood culture were negative. In the following days, the patient developed severe hyponatremia (sodium = 122 mEq/L and 119 mEq/L), and postural hypotension was identified (supine resting = 122/60 mmHg and standing = 100/60 mmHg). The results of computed tomography of chest and abdomen are shown in Figures and . Serum cortisol and ACTH were, respectively, 1.03 μg/dL (4.3–22.4 μg/dL) and 626 pg/mL (12–46 pg/mL), and serum TSH was 8.06 μU/mL (0.35–5.5 μU/mL). The patient received intravenous hydrocortisone, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. Electrolyte abnormalities, anorexia, and difficulty to swallow are resolved. A biopsy of the left adrenal gland showed signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma with areas of necrosis. In the immunohistochemical study, the cells were positive for CK7, TTF-1, and CEA, and negative for CK20, vimentin, CA19.9, CD10, prostatic specific antigen, and thyroglobulin. Therefore, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin was made. Bone and brain metastases were not evident in bone scintigraphy and brain computerized tomography. A few days later, the patient was switched to 5 mg oral prednisone and 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone and was discharged to his home. One month after initiating glucocorticoids, he came to the outpatient oncology division.

    "Lower Limit": "266.686",
    "Upper Limit": "294.758",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mEq. To convert from 134.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 134.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 134.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 134.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 134.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 21.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 94.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 134.0 + (21.0 / 2.8) + (21.0 / 18) = 280.722 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 280.722 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 57-year-old female (body height 156 cm; body weight 64 kg) was referred to our hospital due to abdominal pain caused by a large uterine myoma. Nine years prior, she was diagnosed with polycythemia and an increased erythropoietin level (Fig. ), although she was asymptomatic. At that time, the erythropoietin level soon began decreasing slightly without medication, and thus, the follow-up was completed. However, at the time of admission to our hospital, the patient’s blood test results had worsened. Although she did not report any symptoms other than abdominal pain and her activity level was not impeded, blood tests showed a relatively high level of erythropoietin and a remarkably high level of hemoglobin. Levels of hemoglobin and erythropoietin were 21.9 g/dl (normal 11.5–15 g/dl) and 23.2 IU/ml (normal 4.2–23.7 IU/ml), respectively (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large uterine myoma measuring 25 cm in diameter. Therefore, she was suspected to have an erythropoietin-producing uterine myoma. There were no apparent symptoms of arterial or venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which were ruled out by contrast computed tomography. Platelet count, coagulation test results, fibrinogen levels, and D-dimer levels were within normal ranges.\nPrior to abdominal total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, phlebotomy was scheduled to treat polycythemia; this reduced the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. The patient was phlebotomized, 300 ml once a week, for up to 3 weeks without any complications. Despite the phlebotomy, hemoglobin levels remained high (Fig. ); thus, isovolemic hemodilution was planned to be performed immediately following anesthesia induction.\nFollowing placement of an epidural catheter into the epidural space at Th12/L1, general anesthesia was induced with 120 mg propofol, 0.1 mg fentanyl, and 50 mg rocuronium; it was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.25 μg/kg/min remifentanil, and 10 mg rocuronium per 30 min. Electrocardiogram, bispectral index, end-tidal CO2, body temperature, and SpO2 were monitored during the surgery. Following induction of general anesthesia, an arterial 22 G catheter was placed in the radial artery, from which approximately 800 ml of blood was collected over 45 min while an equal amount of third-generation 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4/9 was infused from a peripheral venous 18 G catheter. As a result, the hemoglobin level dropped to 13.9 g/dl (Fig. ). The surgery was performed with a total blood loss of 285 ml. During surgery, the infusion mainly comprised acetic acid Ringer’s solution and HES 130/0.4/9; the total infusion volume was 3600 ml. Determination of the infusion volume was based on cardiac and stroke volume indexes, measured with a FloTrac™/Vigileo™ system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA; SVVFloTrac). The patient’s urine volume was 590 ml. At the end of the surgery, the hemoglobin level was within the normal range (Fig. ); thus, transfusion of autologous blood was not needed. Shortly after the end of the surgery, the trachea was uneventfully extubated, and the patient was transferred to the high care unit.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 2, following removal of the epidural catheter, a daily subcutaneous injection of fondaparinux 2.5 mg was initiated and continued for 5 days to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there were no symptoms of thrombosis or bleeding. Continuous epidural analgesia with 0.25% levobupivacaine at a rate of 5 ml/h was performed postoperatively, and the patient did not report severe pain. Hemoglobin levels remained within the normal range, and the erythropoietin level dropped dramatically (Fig. ).

He was a bus driver. He had no particular past medical or social history other than the occasional ingestion of wild mushrooms during recreational hiking. He was healthy before this admission. He did not have a history of trauma, infection, other known underlying cause, or medication use that could explain the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis. He shared the meal with his wife and son who did not eat any more mushrooms due to nausea after ingesting a single piece of mushroom. However, he ate the mushrooms without immediate symptom. Six hours later, he began to complain of vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. He visited a local hospital where his general condition worsened and systolic BP fell to 60 mmHg requiring dopamine treatment and endotracheal intubation. Twenty-eight hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of our hospital. At the time of admission, he was alert, but acute ill-looking. He complained of generalized myalgia, chest discomfort, palpitations, and dyspnea. Blood pressure was 80/56 mmHg, heart rate 121/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and body temperature 36.3oC. Oliguria was noted with no response to intravenous fluid and furosemide. Systolic murmurs were present on auscultation.

Blood and urine cultures were all negative for microorganism. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.04, PaCO2 69 mmHg, PaO2 172 mmHg, and HCO3\n- 18.7 mmol/L. Chest radiographs revealed mild cardiomegaly without lung lesion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with QT prolongation. The enlarged left ventricle (LV), severe LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 30%), and akinesia of LV mid to apex wall suggesting stress induced cardiomyopathy were noted on echocardiography.

Her height and weight were 154.6 cm and 51.1 kg, respectively. She was scheduled for mitral valvuloplasty under minimally invasive thoracic incision using Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positing (AESOP, Computer Motion, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Preoperative evaluation showed nothing abnormal except for severe MS. Her recent medication history included ramipril and torasemide for symptomatic relief of dyspnea.\nPrior to induction of anesthesia, a 5-lead electrograph, a non-invasive hemodynamometer, a pulse oximeter, a BIS sensor, and two cerebral oxymetry sensors were placed and monitored. After sufficient denitrogenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with 12 mg of etomidate, 50 mg of rocuronium, and continuous infusion of propofol (target effect site concentration 1.0 ug/ml) and remifentanil (target effect site concentration 10 ng/ml) using a target controlled infusion system (Orchestra®, Fresenius vial, Brezims, France). After intra-arterial cannulation of the left radial artery, endotracheal intubation was performed uneventfully. A central venous catheter (MAC™ Two-Lumen Central Venous Access set, ARROW®, Reading, PA, USA) with a Swan-Ganz catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo, CCO/SvO2/CEDV, Edwards lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA) was placed in her right subclavian vein. Superior vena cava (SVC) cannulation was performed with a 17 Fr femoral arterial cannula (DLP®, Medtronic inc.,Minneapolis, MN, USA) in her right internal jugular vein after injection of 1530 units of heparin. During the operation, anesthesia was maintained with oxygen (2 L/min) and continuous infusion of propofol (target effect site concentration 1.0-1.5 ug/ml), remifentanil (target effect site concentration 10-20 ng/ml), and rocuronium 5 ug/kg/min. There were no clinically significant periods of hypotension during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. There were also no adverse events during CPB, and perfusion pressures were well-maintained at 50-78 mmHg. After initial mitral valvuloplasty and CPB weaning, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed, which revealed mild to moderate degree of MR. CPB was restarted and valvuloplasty was performed again. The second attempt was successful without signs of regurgitation or stenosis. Total CPB time was 101 minutes, pump flow rate was maintained at an appropriate level of 2.4 L/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure was maintained over 50 mmHg. Monitoring of cerebral blood flow adequacy by brain oxymeters showed no significant decreases in cerebral blood flow during CPB. Lowest temperature under CPB, as measured by an esophageal stethoscope, was 27.3℃. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit after surgery and was extubated 5 hours later. Immediately after extubation, the patient complained of profound bilateral hearing loss. Bilateral ear fullness and tinnitus were present, but not vertigo. Otoscopic examination on the same day showed that both ears were normal and there were no other neurologic abnormalities. On postoperative day 1 the patient's hearing improved slightly. Audiometry results on postoperative day 2 () indicated acute SNHL with hearing impairment in the high frequency range, with the right ear more affected. Due to the immediate postoperative state of the patient, high dose steroid therapy was not initiated and intratympanic steroid injection was considered if she did not recover. However, without any therapy, the patient's hearing had recovered such that she did not feel very uncomfortable by postoperative day 3. Follow up audiometry on postoperative day 4 also demonstrated improved hearing in both ears. The patient was discharged one week after surgery, and postoperative echocardiography demonstrated successful mitral valve repair without dehiscence or pathologic regurgitation. Additional audiometry on postoperative day 17 () showed that her hearing had almost fully recovered.

Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL.

In the last two weeks of her pregnancy (begin of the 35th week of gestation), she had to walk on crutches, as she was unable to bear her full weight due to the severe pain in her hips. During this time she took paracetamol daily. Her treating gynaecologist did not initiate any clarification of the symptoms by radiologic imaging methods in this period. Considering her severe pain, it was decided to deliver the child per elective caesarean section (37th +4 week of gestation). Three days postpartum, after being released from the hospital, she had an epileptic seizure and fell. She was admitted to a neurological department of another hospital. During her two-day stay in this department, the woman complained of severe pains in both hips. X-rays and a computer tomography (CT) of the pelvis were performed, revealing bilateral femoral neck fractures. Following this diagnosis, the patient was referred to our department for further treatment.\nRegarding her past medical history, she had childhood migraine and epilepsy. She suffered from her first epileptic seizure at the age of 15. She was treated with valproate over 11 years and remained seizure-free during that time. Her treating neurologist stopped the medication two years prior to her pregnancy. The patient did not have any other comorbidities. Particularly, she did not report on any past history of fractures, irregular menstruation, or family history of osteoporosis.\nAt presentation in our department, the clinical examination showed massively reduced hip movement on both sides because of severe pain. Serum laboratory examination was normal.\nBased on the age of the patient, the limited bone quality, the age of the fractures, and their displacement (Figures and ), it was decided to perform a bilateral hip joint replacement with the use of short-stemmed prostheses (). There were no intra- or postoperative complications. Both femoral heads were sent for further histopathological examination. The results of both femoral heads revealed fracture areas with hemorrhagia, proliferation of fibroblasts in the marrow cavities, and formation of focal woven bone as a sign of the bone remodelling, being indicative for a TOH. Postoperatively, the patient was mobilized on crutches under full weight bearing of the operated extremities. After consultation with our Department of Neurology, the patient restarted her valproate medication. Due to this medication, the patient was advised not to breastfeed her child. Since the TOH is regarded to be a self-limiting disorder, no specific osteoporotic treatment was applied. The further course was uneventful, and the patient was dismissed after two weeks.\nAt 1-year follow-up, the patient is free of any complaints and has no limitation in the range of motion of both hips (extension/flexion 0°-0°-100°, abduction 50°). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

The patient described the lower abdominal pain as sharp and intermittent in nature, rated as 10/10 in intensity, radiating to the back, with no worsening or relieving factors and associated with multiple bouts of nausea and vomiting. The patient reported starving for two days prior to admission, as she had not been able to take in foods and worried that food would worsen the abdominal pain. Otherwise, the patient denied fever, chills, rigors, changes in bowel movement and urinary symptoms. The patient also denied vaginal discharge, and reported no history of sexually transmitted diseases or oral contraceptives and was not sexually active. The patient’s last menstrual period was a few days prior to admission. She also denied any recent sick contact or travel. The patient was not on any medications and supplements such as acetaminophen, salicylates, isoniazid or iron. The patient also denied the use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs.\nIn the emergency room, the patient started to complain of shortness of breath, tachypnea and acute respiratory distress. Initial vitals showed a blood pressure of 152/104 mmHg, a heart rate of 142 bpm, a respiratory rate of 24 bpm and a saturation rate of 98% on 2 L/min of oxygen. Abdominal examination showed soft, non-distended, diffuse tenderness over the lower abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly and normal bowel sounds. Lung and cardiovascular examinations were otherwise normal. Complete metabolic profile showed sodium 132 mmoL/L, potassium 6.4 mmoL/L, bicarb 5 mmoL/L, chloride of 100 mmoL/L, corrected anion gap 29 mmoL/L, lipase was 97 U/L and HbA1c 4.4%. Arterial blood gas showed pH 6.88, pCO2 12 mmHg, pO2 162 mmHg and HCO3 2.7 mmHg. Delta (delta) gap was 0.9, and the patient was experiencing mixed anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urine anion gap was 31.7 mmol/L, with urine pH of 5.5, 2+ protein, no glycosuria and no urine casts observed on urine microscopy. Serum glucose was normal (128 mg/dL) and 3+ ketonuria were present. Lactic acid was 1.7 mmol/L with no uremia (blood urea nitrogen was 6 mg/dL). Lipase was 73 U/L (within normal range). Salicylate acid, acetaminophen and ethanol level were normal. The patient’s beta-hydroxybutyrate level was more than 4.5 and 3+ ketonuria, suggestive of ketoacidosis as the cause of metabolic acidosis. The workup for methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol and paraldehyde was negative; however, the patient had an elevated osmolar gap, with a gap of >20 which was thought to be from the ketoacidosis. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. EKG showed sinus tachycardia (with heart rate of 130 bpm), normal axis and no ST-T wave abnormalities. CTs of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any signs of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic atrophy or peripancreatic fluids. There was a large uterine fibroid noted at the endometrial cavity. A transvaginal ultrasound showed two discrete fibroids measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 2 cm and 4.7 x 2.6 x 3.4 cm on the subserosa (Figure ) and intramural (Figure ) of the endometrium, respectively. The lower abdominal pain may have been related to the uterine fibroids, as she had negative pregnancy test and no previous gynecological problems.\nWe diagnosed the patient with starvation ketoacidosis due to vomiting, two days of starvation and the absence of other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patient was given six ampoules of sodium bicarbonate at the emergency department and was then sent to intensive care unit (ICU). The patient received supplemental oxygen, dextrose and a bicarbonate drip in the ICU. The patient developed refeeding symptoms with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia.

    "Upper Limit": "0.828",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 132.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 132.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 132.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 132.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 132.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 132.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 132.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 5.0 mEq/L) = 27.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 27.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 27.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 27.0 - 12 = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 15.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 15.0 mEq/L / 19.0 mEq/L = 0.789. The patient's delta ratio is 0.789.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 42-year-old male whose Crohn's disease had been controlled with medications for more than 19 years visited the emergency room (ER) with small bowel dilation and mechanical ileus in October 2018. Emergency surgery was performed because the ileus became exacerbated and small intestinal perforation was suspected. A severe adhesion and a fistula were found at the 200 cm point (in the Treitz ligament) and another severe adhesion was evident in the distal ileum. Bowel segments about 80 cm in length both proximal and distal to the lesion were resected and then loop ileostomy was formed. The remaining small bowel was 160 cm in length.\nAt the time of ER admission, an initial nutritional assessment was conducted. He was moderately malnourished based on the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) malnutrition criteria []. His estimated nutritional need was 25–30 kcal/kg usual body weight (UBW)/day with 1.2–2.0 g protein/kg UBW/day based on guidelines for the adult critically ill patient []. Because of the mechanical ileus, total PN was initiated with a target of 25 kcal/kg UBW/day and 1.4 g protein/kg UBW/day. PN was customized to prevent the development of electrolyte imbalances.\nAfter extensive small bowel resection, the estimated energy requirement was 1,500 kcal/day (derived using the Penn State equation). In order to decrease stomal output and allow persistent luminal stimulation, continuous tube feeding with a low-residual formula (500 kcal) was initiated at 20 mL/hr over 24 hours. When he could tolerate 1,200 kcal/day at 50 mL/hr over 24 hours, he was weaned off PN (1,058 kcal/day, protein 58 g/day). According to evaluations about 1 month after surgery (postoperative day [POD] #30), he had continued to lose weight; he weighed 41.1 kg (body mass index [BMI] 13.9 kg/m2) which meant he had lost 21.6% of his body weight at admission. HOS (about 3,000 ml/day) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (24.0 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) were observed, so the risk of dehydration was high. Although on POD #30 magnesium concentration was not measured, it was 1.5 mEq/dL on POD #14, and since it was the marginal level and PN was suspended, deficiency of micronutrient was also expected. Intake via tube feeding was 1,400 kcal/day (34 kcal/kg current body weight [CBW]) and protein 56 g/day (1.35 g/kg CBW). Our NST decided to increase the enteral nutrition (EN) supply to the target calorie level and to provide supplemental PN (commercial 3-in-1 PN with multivitamins and trace elements, 345 kcal/day, protein 16 g/day) to replenish nutrients lost. Total amount supplied, including EN and PN, was 1845 kcal/day (45 kcal/kg CBW) and protein 75.8 g/day (1.85 g/kg CBW).\nHe commenced an oral diet 6 weeks after operation (POD #43) and was again weaned from PN. A dietitian evaluated dietary intake, and assessed stomal output volume and consistency. The estimated dietary intake was 1400 kcal/day with protein 80 g/day. The stomal output was approximately 3,000 mL/day (the bag was emptied 10 times/day) of watery diarrhea. The dietitian educated the patient on the need for frequent small meals, the sipping of fluid between meals (thus not with meals) to ensure hydration, and the avoidance of foods containing high levels of fiber and sugary beverages, which might exacerbate stomal output. Multivitamins and multiminerals were recommended. As a typical Korean meal includes a bowl of vegetable soup and several vegetable side dishes, the need to strictly avoid soup and vegetables was emphasized. The guidelines recommend commencing vegetables 6–8 weeks after operation. However, given his HOS status, a vegetable-free diet was maintained until the stomal output fell to below 2,000 mL/day, even 8 weeks after the operation. To enhance compliance and to help him understand the principles of food selection, the dietitian visited him 4 times.\nAs discharge approached, the dietitian conducted a nutritional re-assessment. The patient exhibited severe malnutrition based on the ASPEN/AND criteria []. He had lost 25.4% of his body weight and exhibited moderate loss of muscle mass and body fat. His estimated nutritional requirements were 35–45 kcal/kg UBW/day and 1.5–2.0 g protein/kg UBW/day. He was taking 1,800 kcal and 90 g protein/day but still losing weight. To increase his weight and improve his nutritional status, home PN support was recommended. The NST planned home PN three times/week (commercial 3-in-1 PN with multivitamins and trace elements, 578 kcal, protein 26 g).\nWhen he was re-admitted 1 month after discharge (POD #106), nutritional re-assessment was performed. His percent of ideal body weight value was 71.6%, his BMI was 15.8 kg/m2, and the nutritional intake met his requirements; his nutritional status had improved compared to that 1 month earlier. His progress is summarized in .\nThe energy intakes from both EN and PN after loop ileostomy are shown in . Two months after operation (POD #60), his body weight was 40.3 kg at discharge. He maintained the oral intake that he had established in the hospital, and received home PN, for 2 months after discharge.

Although a large stomal output (about 3,000 mL/day) of watery diarrhea was observed in the early postoperative period, the electrolyte balance was optimized via infusion therapy.

Pertinent past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery (RCA) 18 years prior, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with bilateral superficial femoral artery stenting two years prior and atrial fibrillation with recent ablation.\nPhysical exam revealed cold lower limbs and there was bilateral absence of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. He had decreased sensation to light touch with preserved strength. The remainder of the physical exam including heart and lung auscultation was unremarkable. Arterial Doppler studies showed occluded stent grafts in the superficial femoral arteries and popliteal arteries bilaterally. A subsequent CT angiogram of his lower extremities confirmed these findings, revealing minimal flow within the dorsal right calf arteries, with no flow being identified within the left calf arteries (Figure ).\nHis initial laboratory results were remarkable for hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 104.3, white blood cell (WBC) count 4.6 k/uL, and platelet count 46 k/uL.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L. The patient's concentration of AST is 36.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of ALT is 22.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of platelets is 367000.0 count/µL. To convert 367000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 367000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 367000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 367000000000.0/(10^9) = 367.0 billion platelet counts per liter. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (63 * 36.0)/(367.0 * sqrt(22.0)) = 1.318.

Operation was recommended, but the patient refused and only received medical therapy.\nThe blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, the pulse was 112/min, the temperature was 37.4°C, and the respirations were 20/min. On examination, he appeared chronically ill. He was noted to have tall and thin stature with long tapered extremities and spider-like appearance of both hands. A grade III/VI holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex, with prominent radiation to the axilla. There were no palpable hepatosplenomegaly and lymph nodes. An ophthalmic examination by slit lamp showed lower lens zonular fibers due to mild upward displacement of lens in both eyes, that is, ecopia lentis, but he had adequate vision ().\nThe blood count showed a white cell count 107,700/mm3, hemoglobin 11.6g/dL, and platelet count 93,000/mm3.

Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 112.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 107700.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.

Laboratory investigations showed anemia (98 g/L), elevated serum urea (6.7 mmol/L) and creatinine (58 μmol/L), and decreased albumin (21 g/L). Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (4+) and microscopic hematuria (3+). Urinary protein was 2.06 g/24 h.

    "problem": "<Context> A 20-year-old, left-hand dominant woman (height 167 cm, weight 63 kg, body mass index 22.6 kg/m2) was in a motocross accident in June 2012 when she sustained a three-part fracture dislocation of the left proximal humerus () in addition to axillary nerve injury on the ipsilateral side. Using conscious sedation, the dislocation was reduced in an emergency department on the same day and without difficulty. Three days later an MRI scan was performed and showed no evidence of rotator cuff tears. One week later, she underwent ORIF, which included a metal plate and screws () and was performed by JGS. The rotator cuff was found to be intact by gross examination. Numbness in the axillary field was noted before and after surgery.\nA nerve conduction study with electromyography was done 6 months after the shoulder trauma. The results of this study showed severe left axillary neuropathy with ongoing denervation and no evidence for reinnervation and possible additional mild injury to the suprascapular nerve.\nIn May 2013 (11 months after her initial injury), she had increasing shoulder subacromial crepitus and anterior glenohumeral stiffness, which was treated with arthroscopic debridement of subacromial bursitis with acromioplasty, arthroscopic anterior capsular release and open deep metal removal. Gross examination showed that the supraspinatus insertion was intact and the metal plate was not seen to be causing subacromial impingement. However, supraspinatus tendon thinning was seen but was not given any special consideration at that time.\nNine weeks later, she sustained acute left shoulder pain and motion loss after she pushed herself upward on her arms to lift herself up while sitting on the back of a pickup truck. Her shoulder motion decreased from 120° to 80° of active overhead elevation. MR images showed a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus and upper infraspinatus tendons () and a full-thickness tear of the intra-articular biceps tendon. This injury was preceded by several months of aggressive physical therapy and shoulder strengthening and exercise. We speculated these activities, coupled with glenohumeral subluxations from chronic deltoid atrophy, had intrinsically weakened her upper rotator cuff and biceps tendon. An open repair of the rotator cuff tear with biceps tenodesis was performed in July 2013 by JGS. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

Examination revealed that she had a tender and erythematic area with local edema on the right leg (4 × 6 cm); the patient was conscious. Her temperature was 39.6°C, pulse was 125/min; blood pressure was normal (100/60 mmHg). At the time of admission, hematology revealed hemoglobin = 10.2 g/dL, white blood cells = 24,000/mm3, and platelets = 175,000/mm3; urinary analysis showed 3+ hemoglobinuria and microscopic hematuria without proteinuria. Serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were normal (0.4 and 25 mg/dL, respectively); other blood chemistry results were unremarkable. Coomb's test was negative and the G6PD level and peripheral blood smear were normal. At this time, the patient received polyvalent antivenom, cefazoline, and 20 meq/L sodium bicarbonate in dextrose water.\nDuring the first week, SCr and BUN levels gradually rose (8.6 and 100 mg/dL, respectively), but the hemoglobin level and platelet count dropped to 8 g/dL and 47,000/mm3 respectively. A blood smear showed fragmented erythrocytes and burr cells; total serum protein level was 5.9 g/dL, albumin level was 3.3 g/dL, calcium level 9.2 mg/dL, phosphorus level 6.2 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase 16358 IU/L. Urinary analysis showed 3+ proteinuria, 3+ hemoglobinuria, and erythrocyte casts. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal (12 and 32 seconds, respectively). A sonogram of the urinary tract was normal. Bone marrow aspiration revealed essential hypercellular marrow with increased megakaryocytes, erythroid hyperplasia, and a shift to the left in myelopoiesis.

Her past medical history included an embolic cerebrovascular event a year earlier with no residual focal neurology, hypertension, treated hypothyroidism, diverticulosis, anaemia of chronic disease, and chronic noninfective diarrhoea of 3 years' duration. This had been extensively investigated by several gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons.\nOn admission she was passing 8–10 loose motions a day. She was on treatment with levothyroxine 125 micrograms OD, clopidogrel 75 mg OD, aspirin 75 mg OD, atorvastatin 40 mg OD, ranitidine 150 mg BD, zopiclone 7.5 mg OD, citalopram 10 mg OD, folic acid 5 mg OD, loperamide 2 mg TDS, co-codamol 8/500 2 tablets QDS, and desloratadine 5 mg OD.\nOn examination she was apyrexial, the pulse was 60 beats per minute and regular, and the supine blood pressure was 157/55 mmHg. Saturation on air was 95%. The rest of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination was within normal limits. There were no history of liquorice use, no clinical evidence of somatic neuropathy, and no evidence of adrenal adenomas on abdominal CT examination done prior to admission.\nThe investigations were as follows: haemoglobin 12.7 g/L, sodium 143 mmol/L, potassium 3.0 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate 27.6 mmol/L, pH 7.46, magnesium 0.72 mmol/L, adjusted calcium 2.21 mmol/L, phosphate 1.08 mmol/L, TSH 0.22 μ/mL, free T4 25 pmol/L, and C Reactive Protein (CRP) 89 mg/L. The admission resting ECG revealed ventricular bigeminy and prolongation of the QTc at 519 msec (normal for females < 470 msec), measured using Bazett's formula as heart rate was less than 65 bpm. Telemetry and Holter analysis confirmed the presence of multiple episodes of polymorphic VT (Torsades de Pointes) (). An echocardiogram confirmed a structurally normal heart with a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%. Coronary angiography confirmed normal appearances with no evidence of overt coronary artery disease.\nThe patient's episodes of polymorphic VT stopped following administration of intravenous and oral potassium as well as magnesium supplementation () and the discontinuation of citalopram, which has been associated with development of long QT syndrome and Torsade de Pointes as an adverse drug reaction []. The QTc normalised within 48 hours following this. The patient was treated with loperamide 4 mg prn and amiloride 5 mg daily to correct the hypokalaemia. Following these interventions potassium levels remained above 4.0 mmol/L. Despite the administration of amiloride and normalisation of the potassium the patient was still experiencing ongoing diarrhoea. Additionally there were past blood tests (ordered by the patient's GP) documenting low potassium levels in the preceding 2 years. With that in mind the cardiology MDT felt that the precipitating cause of the Torsades de Pointes was not fully addressed and thus an ICD would offer the best change of preventing an arrhythmic death. An ICD (dual chamber, Medtronic Evera) was thus prophylactically implanted. Due to the patient's age and in the absence of any previous or family history of syncope and ventricular arrhythmias no genetic tests were performed.\nOn follow-up after six months, she remained asymptomatic with no further syncopal events or symptoms of light headedness, blurred vision, or feeling faint. Repeat blood tests by her GP at 3 and 6 months showed potassium of 4.1 and 4.2 mmol/L, respectively, and she was continuing to take amiloride. No arrhythmias were detected on interrogation of the ICD at the follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-0.7",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.634",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 143.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 143.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 143.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 143.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 101.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 101.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 101.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 101.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 101.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 27.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 27.6 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 27.6 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 27.6 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 27.6 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 27.6 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 27.6 mEq/L) = 14.4 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.4 mEq/L. Plugging in 14.4 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.4 - 12 = 2.4 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.4 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 2.4 mEq/L / -3.6000000000000014 mEq/L = -0.667. The patient's delta ratio is -0.667.",

The pruritus and pain were aggravating as well. His medical and family history was unremarkable. On physical examination, he was 171 cm tall and quite skinny with a weight of 50 kg. The skin showed vesicles, pustules, and papules with an erythematous base on the back and nape, in a wedge-shaped distribution. The chest showed linear erythematous papules and vesicles extending from the center to the left shoulder (Fig. ). Laboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell count of 13,370/mm3 and an anti streptolysin O (ASLO) titer of 469.1 IU/mL (normal: 0–160). All other laboratory results − including a complete blood cell count, blood chemistry panel, liver function tests, and hematology tests including erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein, syphilis, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and urinalysis − were within the normal limits. A specimen for skin biopsy was taken from the vesicle on the middle of chest. The histology showed an intraepidermal vesicle, spongiosis, and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Numerous neutrophils and lymphocytes, dyskeratotic cells, and eosinophils were observed in the vesicle and in the papillary dermis. The dermis showed edematous changes (Fig. ). On immunofluorescence staining, C3, IgG, IgA, and IgM were negative.\nThe patient was admitted to the dermatology department for 10 days and administered doxycycline 200 mg/day, methylprednisolone 40 mg/day and antihistamines to control the acute-phase inflammation. Topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment (Protopic®) was used twice a day and propacetamol 2 g was administered for 10 days at 8-h intervals for pain control. Until the 3rd day of hospitalization, new vesicles and pustules continued to develop on the chest and back area. During dressing, the vesicles and bullae were punctured with a needle and all the skin lesions exfoliated over time (Fig. ). Later, the patient was discharged with improved skin symptoms without recurrence of vesicles and papules. At the time of discharge, the skin lesions on the back showed reepithelialization after exfoliation, leaving behind reticulated hyperpigmentation.

Four-years earlier, she visited a hospital for abdominal distention and was diagnosed with gastric volvulus and congenital megacolon, for which she underwent gastropexy and segmental resection of the transverse colon. Since her symptoms did not improve over the next year, she was referred to our center and underwent a transverse colostomy. After that, she was repeatedly hospitalized and maintained on total parenteral nutrition due to continuously recurring mechanical ileus, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance. Two months before surgery, she was admitted due to abdominal distension and a malfunctioning colostomy. The colostomy function was normalized 2 days later, and she received conservative medical care, including total parenteral nutrition.\nThe patient was scheduled for multivisceral organ transplantation, including seven abdominal organs, the liver, spleen, stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon and pancreas. Cadaveric donor was 5-year-old female 110 cm tall and weighed 21 kg, who had brain death due to increased intracranial pressure caused by medulloblastoma. Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution was used as preservation solution and ischemic time was 170 min. Intraoperative gross finding of the grafts showed no significant abnormality. The recipient was not premedicated and arrived at the operating room with her father. Her blood pressure was 120/64 mmHg, her heart rate was 120 beats/min, and her oxygen saturation on pulse oxymetry was 100% before induction of anesthesia. Pre-operative blood laboratory data were within normal ranges, including hemoglobin (9.4 g/dl), Na+ (142 mmol/L), K+ (3.7 mmol/L), creatinine (0.34 mg/dl), aspartate transaminase (AST; 43 IU/L), alanine transaminase (ALT; 35 IU/L), total bilirubin (0.5 mg/dl), albumin (4.4 g/dl), and prothrombin time (1.00 INR). Anesthesia was induced with 75 mg of pentothal sodium, 15 mg of rocuronium, and 50 µg of fentanyl. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 1% sevoflurane in 50% oxygen in air and continuous infusion of fentanyl (100 µg/h) and vecuronium (2 mg/h). Her brachial artery was cannulated for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter was inserted into her right internal jugular vein and a second into her subclavian vein to monitor central venous pressure and venous oxygen saturation. Femoral venous pressure was also monitored. Ten minutes before graft reperfusion, her vital signs and arterial gas analysis were as follows; mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was 86 mmHg, heart rate was 90 bpm, central venous pressure was 4 mmHg, femoral venous pressure was 16 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7℃, pH was 7.32 with a base excess of -9.5 mEq/L, arterial lactate concentration was 5.6 mmol/L, Na+ was 142 mmol/L, K+ was 2.5 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.83 mmol/L, hemoglobin was 10.8 g/dl, and blood glucose was 98 mg/dl.\nAfter injection of 20 mEq of NaHCO3, graft reperfusion was performed. Just after reperfusion, MAP rapidly decreased to 39 mmHg. Femoral venous pressure decreased after IVC unclamping from 16 mmHg to 4 mmHg and central venous pressure was maintained around 4 mmHg. Because the decrease of arterial pressure was too severe to expect spontaneous recovery and met the definition of PRS (≥ 30% decrease in MAP occurring within 5 minutes after reperfusion and lasting for at least 1 minute). She was immediately administered 5 µg of epinephrine, resulting in an MAP of 44 mmHg. However, repeated injections of 10 µg epinephrine and volume replacement were required to increase her MAP due to prolonged hypotension. Hypotension was sustained over 10 minutes, during which her averaged arterial pressure was 38 mmHg despite intermittent surge of MAP > 60 mmHg (). Arterial blood gas analysis 5 minutes after reperfusion showed severe metabolic acidosis, with a arterial blood pH of 7.09 with a base excess of -17.9 mEq/L, and the arterial lactate concentration was 8.5 mmol/L, K+ was 4.8 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.84 mmol/L, glucose was 114 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 8.5 g/dl. To correct metabolic acidosis and hypotension, she was immediately and repeatedly injected with 30 mEq of NaHCO3 and 10 µg of epinephrine. Her body temperature had decreased to 33.4℃ just after reperfusion, with hypothermia sustained for 30 min (nadir body temperature: 33.0℃) despite active warming with an air warmer. Subsequently, continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.1 µg/kg/min) until the end of the operation was required to maintain her MAP within an acceptable range. At the end of surgery, her body temperature increased to 35.7℃, but metabolic acidosis was sustained despite frequent administration of NaHCO3 (arterial pH: 7.23; base excess: -10.0 mEq/L). During the surgery, the patient was infused with a total of 2,900 ml of fluid, including 1,500 ml of balanced crystalloid solution, 100 ml of half-normal saline, 300 ml of 5% dextrose water, and 1,000 ml of 5% albumin, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells. After 9 hours of surgery, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit. Hemodynamic and laboratory changes during the operation are shown in .\nAfter surgery, the AST and ALT concentrations of the patient increased rapidly (immediate postoperative AST 2,108 IU/L and ALT 2,351 IU/L), reaching 7,300 IU/L and 6,400 IU/L, respectively, on the second day after the operation. She required continuous infusion of fresh frozen plasma due to prolongation of prothrombin time (3.07-5.69 INR). Her total bilirubin concentration, which was 0.5 mg/dl preoperatively, increased to 3.4 mg/dl postoperatively. The patient was diagnosed with primary hepatic graft failure and scheduled for re-transplantation of the liver. An adult to child living donor liver transplantation was performed on the third day after multivisceral transplantation. During this operation, the patient's vital signs remained stable until reperfusion, including a MAP of 70-80 mmHg. Ten minutes before reperfusion, her arterial blood pH was 7.49 with a base excess of -0.1 mEq/L, arterial lactate concentration was 3.8 mmol/L, Na+ was 137 mmol/L, K+ was 3.3 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 0.97 mmol/L, hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl, and blood glucose was 170 mg/dl. After reperfusion, PRS developed again and lasted over 1 min. She received three injections each of 4 µg epinephrine and 20 µg of phenylephrine to maintain MAP within an acceptable level. Her arterial lactate concentration was 3.1 mmol/L at pH 7.44 with a base excess of -2.2 mEq/L, Na+ concentration was 138 mmol/L, K+ was 2.9 mmol/L, Ca2+ was 1.00 mmol/L, and hemoglobin was 6.8 g/dl. After transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells, her vital signs remained stable (MAP: 70-76 mmHg) until the end of the operation. At that time, plasma hemoglobin concentration was 11.9 g/dl, AST was 453 IU/L, ALT was 695 IU/L, total bilirubin was 3.6 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.6 mg/dl, albumin was 2.9 g/dl, and prothrombin time was 1.74 INR. Her serum AST and ALT concentrations decreased gradually. On the seventh day after liver transplantation, AST and ALT concentrations had declined to 69 IU/L and 150 IU/L, respectively, her total bilirubin was 1.4 mg/dl, prothrombin time was 1.07 INR, and feeding through gastrostomy tube was started.

    "problem": "<Context> A 71-year-old Japanese man (height: 170.2 cm; weight: 54.5 kg) was referred to our outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of right facial numbness and itching, cervical pain, and right arm numbness with spasms in 2020. The patient’s history indicated that had been taking a calcium channel antagonist for hypertension (amlodipine, 5 mg/day) for the past 10 years. In 2016, he developed numbness and hypoesthesia in the right side of all branches of trigeminal nerve distribution and was diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal nerve palsy. He has been taking gabapentin, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and clonazepam; however, these drugs did not improve his symptoms. In 2019, the patient developed cervical pain and right arm numbness; he was diagnosed with no evidence of a neurological abnormality.\nAt his first visit in 2020, he had complained of right facial numbness and itching, cervical pain, and right arm numbness. His medical records indicated a right facial palsy with mild numbness localized to the right cheek that might be gradually expanding. However, the sensory disturbance had not spread beyond the face at the time of the first visit.\nA seemingly involuntary spasmodic twitching was noted at the right labial commissure. In addition, his speech was slightly slurred, and the right side of his mouth would fatigue with continued mastication, suggesting oral dyskinesia or a similar neurological disease. Right-dominant bilateral trapezius muscle tenderness and pain of 62 mm in visual analog scale were observed. The sites of the right arm numbness (rated 9/10) and triceps spasm were consistent with C6 involvement. Manual muscle testing was not performed at this time. Blood biochemistry results were within normal limits. On plain cervical radiographs, cervical straightening from C2 to C7 was observed in the lateral view, while signs suggesting stenosis of the right C6 intervertebral foramen were observed in the oblique view. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence of disc protrusion at C5/6 and at C6/7, with no apparent spinal compression or right C6 neuroforaminal stenosis.\nThese findings suggested a diagnosis of cervical discogenic pain or facet arthritis, and his facial symptoms suggested oral dyskinesia or another neurological disease, but not trigeminal nerve palsy. We prescribed mirogabalin (5 mg/day), extended-release paroxetine (12.5 mg/day), and clonazepam (0.5 mg/day) to be taken at bedtime, as well as biperiden (2 mg/day). However, this did not improve his symptoms after 1 week. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, we performed a stellate ganglion block at the second visit; however, this sympathetic nerve block also failed to improve his symptoms.\nBecause we observed tongue fasciculation while examining his complaints of dysphagia at his third visit, we diagnosed bulbar palsy as the cause of his dysphagia. We referred him to the neurology department, where an examination revealed evidence of hypoesthesia and muscle weakness in the right C6 distribution, tongue fasciculation, muscle weakness during neck extension, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. At the first visit to the outpatient service of neurology, the neurologist noted a progressive weight loss. Consequently, the neurological findings were as follows: sensory disturbance in the left trigeminal area and motor weakness on the left face, dysphagia, dysarthria, perioral fasciculation, tongue atrophy, and fasciculation. Attenuation of the corneal and blink reflexes as well as bulbar palsy were confirmed in a series of neurological tests. In the manual muscle strength test, weakness was observed in the trapezius, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscle, but the muscle strength of the lower limbs was normal. The patient also had a positive Trömner reflex but showed no abnormalities in the Romberg test, suggesting upper motor neuron disease with pyramidal tract involvement. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed atrophy of the tongue, trigeminal nerve, and masseter and temporalis muscles. Based on these collective findings, FOSMN was diagnosed, and a neurologist assumed responsibility for the patient’s treatment. The patient’s muscle weakness, weight loss, conversational difficulties, and dysphagia rapidly progressed following our encounters, necessitating a tracheotomy and gastrostomy. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

During the operation, three trocars were applied: Two 10 mm trocars at the umbilicus and in the left lower quadrant, respectively, and a 5 mm trocar in the right lower quadrant, all of which were the bladed type. Additionally, a 24 FR soft silicon tube was drained through the 10 mm trocar port-site in the left lower quadrant. The fascial planes of the umbilical and right lower quadrant port sites were separately stitched with absorbable sutures, while the 10 mm port site in the left lower quadrant was left unclosed (only skin and subcutaneous tissue were sutured to fix the drain). The postoperative recovery was smooth, and gastrointestinal function recovered within 48 h. The drainage tube was removed 4 d after the operation under direct vision when the collected drainage liquid was less than 30 mL per day. One day later, she was discharged to home without discomfort. Six days after the operation, she felt dull pain at the site of the left drain accompanied with nausea, but she did not have difficulty passing stool or flatus. The patient thought the problem was probably due to the incision and did not pay much attention. From that day on, the abdominal pain and distension were gradually aggravated, with the onset of the inability to pass stool and flatus.\nThe patient had a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and uterine fibroids.\nThe patient had no remarkable personal and family history.\nThe primary symptoms were a distended abdomen, strong sensitivity at the left lower quadrant with a rebound, a tender 8 cm in size palpable mass in the left lower quadrant just above the drainage site, and hyperactive bowel sounds.\nAll hematological parameters were within normal limits. The biochemical values were significant for Na+ (131 mmol/L), Cl- (89 mmol/L), glucose level (21.5 mmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (114 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (120 IU/L).\nThe emergency computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the small bowel herniated through the 10 mm drain-site, with diffuse bowel distension and multiple air-fluid levels with gas in the small intestines (Figure ). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 131.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 131.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 131.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 131.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 131.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 21.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 21.5 mmol. To convert 21.5 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.5 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.022 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.022 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.964 g glucose. To convert 3.964 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.964 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3964.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3964.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 396.4 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 21.5 mmol glucose/L converts to 396.4 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 131.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (396.4 - 100) = 138.114 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 138.114 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 56-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism, myotonic dystrophy, and complete heart block on pacemaker presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset shortness of breath and substernal chest pain radiating to the back. There was no history of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or chest trauma. Her history was negative for any gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurological symptoms. She was taking rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for deep vein thrombosis of the left axillary vein diagnosed 7 weeks ago. There was no prior history of tuberculosis, chest irradiation, or chemotherapy. She had a history of pulmonary embolism in 2007 for which she was on coumadin for a year. She had a biventricular pacemaker placed in 2008 for complete heart block induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Complete heart block was diagnosed at the same time and was believed to be secondary to myotonic dystrophy. The pacemaker device reached elective replacement indicator and was replaced with a Medtronic Protecta D314TRG device in 3/2012. She was on Tylenol 500 mg as needed for back pain, levocetirizine 5 mg twice daily for seasonal allergies, and rivaroxaban and zolpidem 5 mg nightly as needed. The above-listed medications do not have p-glycoprotein altering activity or CYP3A4/5 or CYP2J2 inhibiting activity [, ]. The past surgical history and family history were unremarkable.\nIn the ED, her blood pressure was 78/48 mm Hg, pulse 106/minute, temperature 36.5°F, and respiratory rate 18/min with saturation of 87%. Her height and weight were 1.7 m and 180 lbs, respectively. Cardiac examination was normal. Chest examination was significant for bibasilar rales. Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular paced rhythm. There was no associated electrical alternans. Lab tests revealed negative troponin, INR of 1.3, and PTT of 28 s. Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) on chest showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed a large hyperdense pericardial effusion (). Echocardiogram showed moderate-sized circumferential effusion with a swinging heart consistent with pericardial effusion (prior echo 4 years ago showed no pericardial effusion) (). Inferior vena cava was dilated with no respiratory collapse and right ventricle outflow tract collapsed in diastole. With the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, emergency subxiphoid pericardial window was performed and a total of 300 mL of bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Hemostasis was achieved and was satisfactory. Transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed emptying of the collection as well as improved cardiac function. There was immediate improvement in her hemodynamic status. Postprocedure images showed complete resolution of the effusion. Further etiologic workup was unrevealing. Pericardial fluid culture was negative with normal cytology. Pericardial tissue biopsy was negative for malignancy. Thyroid and liver function tests were normal. ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-saccharomyces cerevisae antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, C3, C4, and anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibody were negative making the autoimmune cause unlikely. Myotonic dystrophy was considered to be an unlikely cause of her hemopericardium as pericardial involvement has not been reported with it []. In addition, her previous echo was negative for pericardial effusion. There was no temporal relation to the axillary vein DVT and the pacemaker lead implantation as CT scan done in 2013 and echocardiogram done in 2015 mentioned a normal pericardium with appropriately implanted leads. Intraoperatively, there was no mention of pacemaker lead induced pericardial perforation. Further hospital course, unfortunately, was complicated by healthcare associated pneumonia with septic shock and multiorgan failure. The autopsy was not done. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

His had no history or ongoing (chronic) health problems like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease and atrial fibrillation (AF). He had a smoking history of 15 pack-years. A an 8-mm ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesion had been identifed at the posterior segment (S2) of the right upper lobe during incidental computed tomography (CT) screening 6 months prior to his presentation to us. The ground-glass nodules grew slightly during the follow-up period (Fig. a). Results of all preoperative laboratory tests including electrocardiogram, blood examination and urine examination were within normal limits. Platelet function tests were not performed.\nDuring the surgery, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the arms extended to 90°. General anesthesia was induced, and intubation was achieved via a double-lumen endobronchial tube. The first stage of this operation was opening the oblique fissure. Incomplete oblique fissure was divided via endoscopic stapler (Ethicon ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH EC60A stapler, blue staples). We exposed the central vein, V2a and V2b but not found and isolated the draining veins of posterior segment (S2) specifically (Fig. b). Next the pulmonary artery was dissected distal to expose the posterior segmental artery(A []). The A2 was then dissected, and ligated by hemolok. Then the posterior segmental bronchus was dissected from right superior lobar bronchus. Before closing the bronchus with the stapler, we ventilated the right lung to confirm the target bronchus. The B2 was then transected by stapler (Ethicon ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH EC60A stapler, green staples). Then, the S2 parenchyma was divided followed the inflation-deflation method by stapler (Ethicon ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH EC60A stapler, blue staples) []. The specimen was retrieved in a self-made bag using a surgical glove. Examination of a frozen section confirmed lung adenocarcinoma; Systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy was then performed. The total operation time was 1 h, 15 min. The postoperation pathological diagnosis of the tumor was adenocarcinoma (pT1aN0M0-stage IA1 as defined by the 8th Edition of TNM classification (TNM8) of lung cancer) [].\nAfter surgery the patient returned to the intensive care unit. 20 h later, Mild consciousness disturbance [Glasgow Coma Scale, 11 points (E3V2M6)], conjugate deviation of the eyes to the left, right hemiplegia (Manual Muscle Testing upper limbs score of 1 of 5 and lower limbs score of 0 of 5), mixed aphasia were observed, with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 23. His vital signs were a blood pressure of 118/67 mmHg, a heart rate of 107 /min, a respiration rate of 17 /min and SpO2 of 100% with nasal catheter oxygen at 4 L/min. Emergent head enhanced CT showed left middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion (Fig. a). The left middle cerebral artery were not visualized in intracranial vascular computed tomography angiography (CTA). Considered the risk of hemorrhage in the postoperative period, we decided to perform IAMT. Trombus at the M1 branch of the middle cerebral artery were removed successfully, and successful recanalization was achieved (Fig. b, c). A pathological examination after the operation showed the thrombus were mainly composed of laminar fibrin, abundant neutrophils, and erythrocytes (Fig. ).\nThe patient was observed in the intensive care unit for 3 days. The patient’s Mental status and motor function gradually improved. During this time, We performed some physiological examinations including Holter electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, venous ultrasonography, carotid artery ultrasonography, and also checked blood tests such as coagulation function, and autoantibodies of collagen diseases.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 17.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 17.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 17.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 17.0 - 12 = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 5.0 mEq/L.

After standard monitoring, general anesthesia was induced with pentothal sodium 175 mg, rocuronium 35 mg and remifentanil 0.05 µg/kg/min. Endotracheal intubation was performed using a light-wand. After induction of anesthesia, arterial cannulation was performed with a 20 G catheter in the right radial artery, and central venous cannulation was performed in the right internal jugular vein. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane, a mixture of oxygen and air (FiO2 0.5) and intravenous infusion of remifentanil. The concentration of desflurane was controlled to maintain the bispectral index within 40-60. Warm forced air devices were used to maintain body temperature.\nThroughout the operation, the patient showed no specific abnormalities of her vital signs. Phenylephrine 50 µg/min was infused to maintain the systolic blood pressure between 90 and 110 mmHg. The blood loss was about 1,000 ml and 2,150 ml of crystalloid solution, 500 ml of colloid solution and three pints of packed red blood cells were administered. The surgery was completed uneventfully and the anesthesia lasted 310 min. Core body temperature measured with esophageal stethoscope was around 36℃ during the operation. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed with glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg and neostigmine 1.5 mg at the end of the procedure. However, the patient presented with significantly delayed emergence from anesthesia. The patient was drowsy and needed assisted ventilation due to weak spontaneous respiratory efforts during the 40 min after surgery. At the time, arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH, 7.23; PaCO2, 41 mmHg; PaO2 284 mmHg; HCO3, 17.2 mEq/L and SaO2 100%. Other laboratory examinations revealed sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.9 mmol/L, calcium 1.18 mmol/L, Hb 9.9 g/dl and glucose 112 mg/dl. No specific laboratory values to explain the-delayed emergence were noted. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in an intubated state. Although she was extubated at the intensive care unit after 30 min, she remained minimally arousable. Motor power was reduced from grade IV (mild weakness) to grade I (visible contraction but no movement) in bilateral upper and lower extremities, but no sensory loss was observed. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain MRI and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed on the recommendation of a neurologist on postoperative day (POD) 1. Cervical spine MRI was normal. Brain lesions in bilateral post central gyrus, medial thalami, periventricular region, periaqueductal region and hypothalamus in brain MRI were suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Accordingly, she was started on vitamin B1, but her motor functions and mental status did not recover. EEG showed diffuse cerebral dysfunction. On POD 10, nerve conduction study and electromyography demonstrated axonal dominant sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The neurologist then considered Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient was intubated due to the continuous respiratory muscle weakness and pulmonary infection led to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. On POD 12, hyponatremia (118 mmol/L) and clinical epileptic form discharge on EEG were detected. Symptomatic treatment was eventually with phenytoin and hypertonic saline.\nThe patient showed mental change and motor axonal peripheral neuropathy simultaneously, and presented abdominal pain, nausea and poor oral intake before the surgery. She also showed labile blood pressure (60-188/44-120 mmHg) and tachycardia (100-136 beats/min) suggestive of autonomic dysfunction, respiratory muscle weakness due to peripheral neuropathy and hyponatremia. These findings suggested AIP and the diagnosis was ascertained from detecting high urine porphobilinogen on POD 13. Glucose infusion was given to the patient, with a plan to administer heme arginate if the symptoms persisted.\nAlthough her motor power was gradually improved, her general condition deteriorated rapidly with aggravating pneumonia and she expired on POD 35. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 112.0 mg/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (112.0 - 100) = 138.288 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 138.288 mEq/L.",

General anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol 200 mg plus fentanyl 100 μg and a size 4 LMA ProtectorTM Airway was placed smoothly in a single attempt by a senior resident. The cuff was inflated with 25 ml of air and the black line indicator on the cuff pilot valve remained within the green zone throughout the surgery. However, we did not check the intra-cuff pressure using manometry. The oropharyngeal leak pressure was 25 cmH2O. The sternal notch test and bubble test were performed after insertion to confirm the placement of the LMA protector []. Anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of sevoflurane and oxygen/air. The patient’s breathing was supported with a pressure support of 8 cmH2O, which generated a tidal volume of 400–450 ml and the maximum minute ventilation attained was 12 L/min with peak pressures of 8–10 cmH2O. He was placed in a supine position with standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitoring for the surgery which lasted for 180 minutes. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient’s vital signs were stable throughout. Postoperatively, the LMA was removed smoothly when he was awake. Moreover, blood stains or minimal secretions were not observed on the device.\nAt the post anesthesia care unit, the patient complained of difficulty in chewing food and a weird tongue movement. He had no voice changes or altered taste sensation. On examination, the patient’s tongue was seen to be deviated to the left during active protrusion (). All sensations of the tongue were intact and there were no tongue fasciculations or wasting. The neurological examination revealed no lateralizing signs or limb weakness. The gag and cough reflexes as well as other cranial nerves were normal. The patient was referred to the ENT surgeon the same day. The nasoendoscopy examination was unremarkable. The working diagnosis was that of an isolated left hypoglossal nerve palsy or neuropraxia. He was allowed to go home the same day with reassurance, oral prednisolone for one week, and instructed for follow up at the ENT outpatient clinic. Neuroimaging was not required.

Palpitations were most noticeable at night but had become more severe and constant over the preceding three days. He also reported shortness of breath while supine in bed and lightheadedness with exertion. The patient is an avid hiker, so he only presented once his dyspnea prevented him from completing a typical family hike. He denied any chest pain, fevers, weight loss, syncope, leg swelling, cough, nausea, vomiting, or rashes.\nThe patient was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus when he was 30 and has a history of hypertension. He was taking insulin glargine nightly with sliding-scale insulin aspart during meals and had recently switched from ramipril to losartan 50 milligrams (mg) daily due to nocturnal cough. He denied any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. His father died suddenly at age 42 due to a heart attack. He denied any allergies.\nThe patient’s vital signs on presentation were as follows: temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure 131/83 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg); pulse 55 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation 99% on room air, with a body mass index of 28.6 kilograms per meters squared. Physical exam revealed a well-developed and well-nourished male patient in no acute distress. His head was normocephalic and atraumatic. His eye exam was normal with pupils that were equal, round, and reactive to light. No scleral icterus was seen. His neck was supple and had normal range of motion. There was no jugular venous distension seen. The patient’s cardiac exam was notable for a bradycardic and irregularly irregular heartbeat without a murmur. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no wheezes or rales were heard. The patient’s abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. His extremities were warm and well perfused, and without edema. The patient’s cranial nerves II–XII were intact, and gait and strength assessments were unremarkable. No pronator drift was seen.

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old retired white female accountant was admitted to our neurology department for progressive cognitive decline, which had started insidiously, about four years prior to admission. Her symptoms were difficulty with language, sensory dysphasia, impairment of memory, and overall disorientation. According to her husband, her first symptom was the inability to form uncommon and complex words, so aphasia was the most prominent deficit at symptom onset leading to impaired daily living activities. Her condition slowly deteriorated leading to a loss of everyday activities, becoming unable to perform simple tasks related to household, then to her personal hygiene. Her husband reported that the executive performance as well as her spatial and temporal orientation varied over time and showed frequent daily alterations. She had type-2 diabetes for 4 years well controlled with diet and metformin. She had atrial fibrillation necessitating preventive apixaban treatment. She has had hypertension and hypercholesterinemia for 5 years treated with the combination of simvastatin, betaxolol, valsartan, furosemide, and digoxin. She was taking paroxetin for depression. Her body mass index was 25 with normal vital parameters apart from arrhythmia. She was passive and apathic while in hospital; lying inactively in bed the whole time, often in a sleep-like state during the day and apparently remaining so in the night. She was sometimes cheerful, tolerating and cooperating reasonably well with any queries or interventions; she seemed friendly and quiet with no interest, motivations, or denial.\nHer blood screen, TSH, and coagulation parameters were normal. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau-level was 239 pg/ml (normal range: 341±171 pg/ml), p-tau level was 24 pg/ml (normal range: 35.84–66.26 pg/ml), amyloid-β (Aβ) level was 717 pg/ml (normal range: 797±230 pg/ml), the Aβ/tau ratio was 3, while the Aβ/p-tau ratio was 29.88. Thus, the amyloid and tau levels in the CSF were in the normal range excluding AD. CSF ubiquitin or TDP-43 testing could not be performed.\nThe MRI brain scan revealed moderate small vessel disease with important diffuse cerebral atrophy, mainly affecting the frontal and temporal lobes with left side dominance ().\nTo analyze structural results more precisely, hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness were calculated with FreeSurfer5.3 image analysis suite (freely available for download: ). The technical details are demonstrated in previous reports, no changes were made to the pipeline. The image process contains motion correction, removal of non-brain tissue, automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of deep gray matter structures and subcortical white matter, intensity normalization, tessellation of white-gray matter boundary, automated topology correction and surface deformation following intensity gradients. Following the cortical models, Freesurfer managed deformable procedures such as surface inflation, registration to spherical atlas, parcellation of cerebral cortex into units and creation of different surface based data. Cortical models and results of segmentation were quality controlled.\nAverage left frontal thickness (in mm) was 1.79±0.16, right frontal thickness was 2.01±0.21, left temporal thickness was 2.33±0.32, right temporal thickness was 2.45±0.36, left parietal thickness was 2.01±0.2 and right parietal thickness was 2.18±0.29. The temporal and frontal values are below the normal ranges if we compare it to data from the literature, especially on the left side, while the parietals are relatively preserved, being in line with the previous reports on FTD []. The volume of the left hippocampus was 3301 mm3, and of the right was 3997 mm3. These values are in the normal range based on our previous study with the same analysis method []. However, the left hippocampus was significantly smaller showing 17.5% asymmetry which suggests pathological changes in the volume of left hippocampus besides the normal values. Volumetric asymmetry could be considered significant above 10%. The volume of the left entorhinal cortex was 1881 mm3, while that of the right was 1811 mm3. These values and the disappearance of the difference between the two sides indicate Alzheimer or frontotemporal pathology based on previous data []. Altogether, the left dominant frontotemporal thinning and normal parietal thickness, and the involvement of the entorhinal cortex suggested the morphometry of FTD []. The routine EEG showed 20–40 uV, 9-10 Hz alpha background with frontal beta activity. We detected occasional left temporal focal slowing. No specific epileptiform activity were seen. Detailed neuropsychological analysis including Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) was performed. This test has a high sensitivity (0.9) and specificity (0.93) in the differentiation of cognitive disorders, especially in the diagnosis of AD and FTD []. Her ACE score was 32/100. The Verbal-Language/Orientation-Memory ratio of ACE, which sensitively discriminates AD and FTD [], scored 1.9 suggesting FTD. The Mini-Mental State Examination score extracted from ACE [] was 16/30. The neuropsychological results were consistent with a moderate cognitive decline. The most impaired cognitive domains were single-word retrieval in spontaneous speech and naming, reading, verbal short-term memory; whereas repetition, spatial orientation and grammar were relatively preserved. No early behavioral disinhibition, apathy/inertia, early loss of sympathy/empathy, presence of perseverative behavior and hyperorality were reported, so the diagnosis of behavior variant FTD was improbable []. Based on current diagnostic recommendations, we diagnosed primary progressive aphasia related to FTD []. Based on the caregiver’s report on the significant daily variability of her cognitive functions the presence of diffuse Lewy-body dementia was also considered. However, its core criteria as Parkinsonism or visual hallucinations were not present, therefore it was excluded. To assess the severity of cognitive fluctuation we used an easily applicable, bed-side test with high sensitivity in measuring visuo-spatial performance, the Corsi Block-Tapping Task (CBTT) []. We carried out CBTT with 2-3 items four times in one day; in better and worse cognitive periods (reported by the medical staff and her husband) and compared the number of correct answers with ANOVA analysis using the IBM SPSS20 software. We revealed significant differences in the results of the four trials (df: 3; Mean Square: 1.098; F: 4.567; p: 0.004). Based on both the neuropsychology scores and the history suggesting the possibility of non-convulsive seizure-episodes, we suspected concomitant epilepsy. Risk factors for developing epileptic seizures including definitive structural lesions on MRI, previous history of head trauma, childhood seizures, CNS infection, drug or alcohol dependency or electroconvulsive therapy were absent.\nTo disclose the potential epileptiform activity, we performed a 24-h Holter-EEG, followed by a 3-day-long continuous scalp video-EEG monitoring. We recorded one episode of slightly irregular rhythmic theta activity lasting for 20 s during light sleep in the right temporal leads. We also detected very rare bitemporal independent sharp waves with slight right dominance, possibly consistent with epileptiform activity []. The long-term EEG revealed disturbed sleep macrostructure with superficial night sleep, no deep sleep and very short REM sleep episodes; no sleep spindles or K complexes were found.\nThe EEG changes supported our suspicion that the significant fluctuations of her cognitive performance might be related to temporal lobe epileptic activity. Therefore, FO electrodes were surgically implanted () under general anesthesia; and continuous video-EEG recording using both FO and scalp electrodes were performed for 4 days.\nThe national and institutional ethic committees approved the FO electrode implantations and the recording; the family of the patient gave written informed consent to the procedure. The FO electrode implantation and the video-EEG monitoring period were uneventful, no surgical complications, behavioral or cooperation issues occurred. Frequent neuropsychological testing with CBTT was carried out during monitoring. The patient perfectly complied so we could perform clean, artefact-free EEG recordings. The recordings revealed bilateral independent spikes on the FO leads; in average, 30 unambiguous single spikes on the right side and 4 on the left per day (). We considered these graphoelements interictal spikes because of their paroxysmal appearance, the abrupt change in polarity, the typical spike duration (less than 70 ms) and because of their consistent temporal field distribution []. The spike activity occurred mainly during superficial NREM sleep, similarly to typical temporal epileptiform activity. We recorded runs of 11-12 Hz beta waves with or without 5 Hz theta elements and spike-like components, mostly during light NREM sleep, much less during wakefulness and none during the short REM periods, as well as >1 s long runs of sharp waves more often on the left side ( and ).\nNone of the epileptiform EEG events propagated onto the scalp electrodes. The spikes and sharp waves had an amplitude <l00 μV, and occurred frequently in the FO electrodes. The FO revealed 15-16 Hz, crescendo-decrescendo beta spindles during wakefulness, frequently preceding movements ().\nBecause of the occurrence of epileptiform discharges, we initiated clobazam treatment during the monitoring period, however there were no changes in the occurrence of epileptiform potentials and the neuropsychological performance following the drug administration in the next 2 days. According to some data, levetiracetam might be effective in AD-related epilepsy and it is easier to reach a steady state much earlier than clobazam [], therefore we started levetiracetam and we plan close follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

He was diagnosed with AIS in a local hospital after performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination (Fig. ) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examination (Fig. ). Cerebral infarction in the right parietal, temporal, insular, and frontal lobes was revealed by the MRI test. The MRA test detected occlusions in right internal carotid artery, A1 segment of right anterior cerebral artery, right middle cerebral artery, and distal branch. For further treatment, he was admitted to our hospital. The patient reported no history of coagulation disorders, cardiovascular disease, special medication, or any other systemic immune disorder, nor was there any recent history of trauma.

His weight was 65 kg and height 168 cm, with 36.3°C body temperature, 82 beats per minute pulse rate, 22 per minute breathing rate, and 119/62 mm Hg blood pressure. The physical examination revealed normal heartbeat and no crackles in the lungs. Neurological examination showed Glasgow Scale of 14, equal and reactive pupils, and unclear speech. In addition, both eyes gazed to the right side. He showed flattened left nasolabial fold, and left deviation of the protruded tongue. The muscle tension of left limbs increased while the muscle strength of left upper limb and left lower limb were grade 1 and grade 2, respectively. He could not perform the left finger-nose test and the heel-knee-tibia test and his left pathological reflex was positive with 12 points of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. Laboratory findings demonstrated that a white blood cell count of 12,770/mm3, with 84.5% neutrophils as well as hemoglobin concentration of 12.6 g/dL and a platelet count of 297,000/mm3. There was no abnormality in liver and kidney function test. D-dimer was 0.10 μg/mL, and C-reactive protein was 3.03 mg/L. Triglyceride was 1 mmol/L and low-density lipoprotein was 2.29 mmol/L. Tests of anti-Sjogren's syndrome B, anti-Sjogren's syndrome A, anti-Jo1, antinuclear antibody, antihistone antibody (AHA) and anti-SM measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were negative. After admission, emergency cerebral angiography and mechanical thrombectomy were performed under local anesthesia. Cerebral angiography revealed that occlusion in the end segment of right internal carotid artery and normal blood flow of left anterior communicating artery. The operation of mechanical thrombectomy was performed successfully. For antiplatelet aggregation, tirofiban was given continuously intravenously (0.15 μg/kg/min body weight). After 24 hours, oral clopidogrel was prescribed (75 mg once per day) and atorvastatin (20 mg once per day) were also administered for him. And after 48 hours, tirofiban was discontinued while clopidogrel (75 mg once per day) and atorvastatin (20 mg once per day) were continuously given. On January 9, 2018, computed tomography angiography (Fig. ) illuminated that the blood flow of right internal carotid artery was restored, and the right middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral artery were demonstrated normally. At the same time, further examinations were arranged for the young patient. Laboratory examinations including thyroid function, antineutrophil antibody, biomarkers of lupus, and tumor revealed no abnormality. Dynamic electrocardiogram showed sinus arrhythmia. There was no abnormality in Doppler echocardiography. Ultrasonography of carotid artery, abdomen, and veins of both lower extremities were also normal.\nAround 2 weeks after admission, the patient was transferred to the rehabilitation department for further treatment.

She had bilateral ovarian tumors detected by pelvic ultrasonography at a local gynecologic clinic for the evaluation of dysmenorrhea and hypermenorrhea. A pelvic ultrasonography revealed a 6.4×5.8×5.3-cm3 mass with irregular margin in the right ovary and a 6.3×5.2×4.2-cm3 multi-septated cystic mass in the left ovary. There was no obvious ascite in the abdominal cavity. Pulsed Doppler examination revealed low-resistant blood flow (resistance index 0.24). On physical examination, severe adhesion between these tumors and the cul-de-sac was noted. The patient's preoperative CA 125 level was 97.3 U/mL and other tumor markers (CA 19-9, CA 72-4, and CEA) were within normal ranges. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a 6.0×4.8×5.3-cm3 ill-defined, heterogenous signal intensity mass, including mixed cystic and solid portions in the right ovary. This mass was considered as a malignancy (i.e., clear cell carcinoma) likely arising from underlying endometriosis. Between the posterior portion of the right ovarian tumor and the cul-de-sac, there was a 5.5×5.0-cm2 enhanced solid mass with an irregular margin invading into the rectal serosa (). Additionally, there was a 7.2×5.9×6.1-cm3 multi-septated cystic mass in the left ovary () that was considered as a benign mucinous cystadenoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed a high probability of ovarian malignancy involving both ovaries and possibly peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patient's preoperative body mass index was 30.84 kg/m2 (height 158-cm, weight 77 kg).\nThe patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, both pelvic lymph nodes dissection, omentectomy, and appendectomy through median incision at supine position. We performed operation for the basis of epithelial ovarian malignancy. A small number of ascites (500 mL) was present and peritoneal cytology was done. The right ovarian tumor measured at approximately 5.0×5.0-cm2 contained a 2.0×3.0-cm2 solid mass and chocolate-colored fluid. This mass was fixed in the cul-de-sac. It was hard indurated because of cancer infiltration. The left ovary mass measured at roughly 5.0×6.0-cm2 was an inflammatory cyst containing yellowish fluid. Multiple seeding lesions were found at rectal serosa, posterior uterine serosa, and appendix. Multiple whitish nodular lesions of up to 3.0×3.0-cm2 were detected at the omentum. These suspicious lesions were biopsied. No intrauterine tumor was found (). Intra-operative frozen biopsy analysis of the right ovarian tumor showed ESS with endometriosis because proliferative stromal cells with scant nuclear pleomorphism and mitosis were seen. Postoperative course was complicated by a disrupted vaginal stump. There was no other complication.\nFinal pathology was consistent with bilateral ovarian ESS arising from foci of endometriosis and involving the uterine serosa, rectal serosa, parametrium, peritoneum, omentum, and appendix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IIIC). No evidence of tumor was found in the corpus of the uterus or the uterine cavity. Both pelvic lymph nodes were negative for tumor cells. The result of peritoneal cytology was negative for malignant cells. The mitotic activity in the spindle cells in the cellular area was limited to a maximum of two figures per 10 high-power fields. Stromal tissues had the characteristic tongue-like growth pattern (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that neoplastic cells were immunopositive to antibodies specific for cluster of differentiation 10 (CD 10) (), Ki 67 (Ki index 3% to 5%) (), and progesterone receptor (). However, these neoplastic cells were immunonegative to estrogen receptor, desmin, alpha inhibin, calretinin, and actin.\nThe patient's CA 125 level was decreased from 97.3 U/mL before surgery to 38.8 U/mL after surgery. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was started one month after the operation in an effort to suppress the growth of any microscopic tumors. The patient had been taking oral megestrol acetate (Megesia, Dalimpharm, Seoul, Korea) at 160 mg daily for one month. She complained about weight gain. Therefore, the patient had been taking oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Farlutal, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) at 500 mg daily for four months. Six months after the beginning of treatment, her CA 125 level was decreased to 22.7 U/mL. Subsequent Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed no evidence of recurrence or metastases. However, she had complaints of generalized edema. Therefore, we decreased her drug dosages. She was taking oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera, Pfizer) at 200 mg daily for three months. Three months later, she refused further hormonal therapy because of lasting side effects. At that time, an abdominopelvic computed tomography showed no evidence of recurrence. Therefore, we stopped the hormonal therapy and planned regular checkups with pelvic examination, tumor markers, and imaging studies. To date, she has shown no signs of recurrence. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

He had a three-day history of watery diarrhoea up to six times a day, intermittent, crampy abdominal pain and fever. This illness developed a day after he had eaten crab cakes, which were out of date. On examination, he was dehydrated with dry mucous membranes. Abdomen was mostly tender in the umbilical and epigastric region but there were no signs of peritonism. The rash was well defined with circular target lesions on his upper and lower limbs. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Vital observations on admission were as follows: temperature of 38.2℃, pulse rate of 110, blood pressure 102/68, respiratory rate of 22 and oxygen saturations of 96% on room air.\nInitial blood tests revealed normal full blood count (Hb 147 gd/L, WBC 5.3 × 109/L, platelets 142 × 109/L), lipase (10 U/L) and electrolytes (sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, magnesium 0.81 mmol/L, phosphate 1.07 mmol/L, adjusted calcium 2.22 mmol/L). However C-reactive protein was raised (83 mg/L), there was acute kidney injury (urea 13.4 mmol/L, creatinine 120 µmol/L, eGFR 34 mls/min/1.73 m2) and liver function tests showed a mixed hepatitic and cholestatic picture (Bilirubin 20 mmol/L, AST 64 U/L, ALT 111 U/L, ALP 155 U/L, GGT 103 U/L and albumin 25). Urinalysis and chest X-ray were unremarkable. He received IV fluids and empirical IV Piperacillin/Tazobactam for sepsis. Stool samples were sent as work up of acute diarrhoea and campylobacter species was isolated. The stool samples were negative for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli. Clostridium difficile toxin was not found in any of the stool samples. Blood cultures were negative. IV antibiotics were stopped upon discussion with microbiology.\nHis diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fever resolved over the four days following admission. Renal function and liver function also improved. However, the rash had spread to his chest, neck, back and hands ( and ()). Dermatology opinion was sought and erythema multiforme major was diagnosed. Histology of a skin biopsy demonstrated a superficial perivascular chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis with features of an interface dermatitis, i.e. basal vacuolation of the epidermis with lymphocytes involving the basal layer.

Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().\nThe brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are not reported and so we assume that this is missing from the patient, keeping the current total at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 0 + 3 = 3. The patient's heart rate is 85.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and so the score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 3. Because the patient has been previously diagnosed for pulmonary embolism (PE), but the patient has never been diagnosed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we increase the current total by 1.5 so that 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. Hemoptysis is reported to be present and so one point is incremented to the score, making the current total 4.5 + 1 = 5.5.

She has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 5 years prior and was being treated with a sulfonylurea (gliclazide 30 mg). Based on the examination results, she was diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and thioctacid (600 mg) was prescribed. She experienced repeated occurrences of hunger, hand tremor, cold sweat, and dizziness 3 to 4 hours after a meal since having taken the drug, but symptoms consistently improved after eating snacks. Her past history was insignificant except an appendectomy 40 years prior. On physical examination, her height was 165 cm and body weight 60 kg. Blood pressure was 130/90 mm Hg. There was no thyroid goiter or skin pigmentation.\nBlood examination showed leukocyte count 4,700/mm3, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, platelet 202,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen 17.0 mg/dL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, total protein 7.1 g/dL, albumin 4.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 26 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 36 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 116 IU/L, total cholesterol 166 mg/dL, triglyceride 115 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 39 mg/dL, calcium 8.8 mg/dL, phosphate 3.3 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, and potassium 4.2 mEq/L. Thyroid and adrenal cortical function tests were performed. Free T4 was 1.12 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.7), thyroid stimulating hormone 2.25 µIU/L (normal range, 0.27 to 4.2), adrenocorticotropic hormone 16.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6 to 56.7), and cortisol 13.4 µg/dL.\nOn admission, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 6.6%, fasting blood glucose 208 mg/dL, and postprandial blood glucose 195 mg/dL. Serum insulin, when measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA, immunoradiometric assay, INSULIN-IRMA, Biosource Europe, Nivelles, Belgium) was normal at 15.33 and 19.41 µIU/mL on fasting and postmeal, respectively (normal range, 2 to 25). However, C-peptide (immunoradiometric assay, C-Peptide IRMA, IZOTOP, Budapest, Hungary) was increased to 13.96 ng/mL on fasting and 18.24 ng/mL after meals (normal range, 1.07 to 3.51).\nSulfonylurea administration was discontinued, but the hypoglycemic symptoms persisted. After eating carbohydrate snacks between meals, daytime frequency of hypoglycemia decreased, but hypoglycemia with a level less than 50 mg/dL persisted at dawn with prolonged fasting. A 72-hour fasting test was attempted but was ended after 6 hours because the patient complained of severe hypoglycemia with a blood sugar level of 44 mg/dL. During a 6-hour examination, the blood sugar levels were 90, 70, and 44 mg/dL at baseline, 4 and 6 hours, and the serum insulin values measured by RIA were within the normal range at 22.92, 22.16, and 27.47 µIU/mL, respectively. The C-peptide values were increased to 15.60, 20.31, and 15.65 ng/mL, respectively. The antinuclear antibody was negative, while the insulin autoantibody value (RIA, Cobra 5010, Biosource Europe) was very high at 53% (normal range, <7). The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II result was DRB1*0406/1454. Abdominal computed tomography revealed no abnormalities in the pancreas ().\nBecause the patient continued to suffer from fasting hypoglycemia after suspending sulfonylurea administration, and serum C-peptide and insulin autoantibody levels increased, she was diagnosed with IAS. As the sulfhydryl-containing thioctacid first administered 2 weeks before the occurrence of hypoglycemia, it was regarded as the causal factor and discontinued. The patient continued to eat complex carbohydrates between meals, but hypoglycemia persisted. Prednisolone (10 mg) administration reduced the frequency of hypoglycemia and was able to be discontinued after 2 months because recovery was observed. At 4 months after diagnosis, the insulin autoantibodies were still high at 80.4%, but no signs of hypoglycemia were evident. At the 2-year follow-up, insulin autoantibody titer was reduced to 50.9%, and hypoglycemia was no longer detected.\nThe patient visited the rehabilitation department of another hospital to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy 2 years after the initial occurrence and was prescribed thioctacid. Hypoglycemia recurred 10 days later, for which she visited our hospital. At that time, the patient was treated with voglibose (0.6 mg). HbA1c was 5.7% and insulin autoantibody was 77.2%. We performed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. The fasting plasma glucose was 98 mg/dL and the 2-hour plasma glucose after glucose load was 135 mg/dL, but serum insulin levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Roche Elecsys insulin test, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) were increased to more than 1,000 µU/mL for both fasting and 2 hours posttest. Fasting and 2-hour posttest C-peptide values were 10.91 and 16.92 ng/mL, respectively. After taking prednisolone (10 mg), she recovered from hypoglycemia. The dose of prednisolone was tapered by 5 mg and was discontinued 2 months later. Before discharge, the patient was instructed to avoid thioctacid. Six months after discharge, most of the values were normalized, i.e., HbA1c 5.7%, serum insulin 267 µU/mL, and C-peptide 3.71 ng/mL, but insulin autoantibodies remained high at 78% without hypoglycemia.\nThe patient was again prescribed thioctacid 2 years after the second occurrence, for which she revisited our hospital due to the recurrence of hypoglycemia. At that time, she was taking voglibose (0.6 mg) as a hypoglycemic agent. Her serum insulin level based on ELISA was abnormal, measuring higher than 1,000 µU/mL, while C-peptide was 21.06 ng/mL and insulin autoantibodies were 96%. According to the test results, the patient was prescribed prednisolone (5 mg), and after 4 months, serum insulin (measured by ELISA) and C-peptide were reduced to 210 µU/mL and 2.81 ng/mL, respectively, but the insulin autoantibodies remained high (88.9%).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 67 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45. The patient's weight is 60.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mEq. To convert from 135.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 135.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 135.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 135.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 135.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.45 * 60.0 * (135.0/140 - 1) = -0.964 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.964 L.",

Hypouricemia was noted on every biochemical examination in health check with a UA level of < 1 mg/dL. However, until now, his renal function and urine findings had been normal, and there was no history of examination at a medical institution. Bilateral loin pain developed during walking. The patient expected an improvement in the pain from walking; hence, he engaged in intensive exercise, including swimming for 1 h, fast walking / jogging for 2 km, and active muscle training for approximately 2 h. However, the pain worsened and persisted. He was then examined at the Department of Urology at our hospital. Renal calculi were ruled out via computed tomography (CT), but with a creatinine (Cr) level of 3.7 mg/dL, acute kidney injury with hyperbilirubinemia was diagnosed. The patient was then examined at the Department of Nephrology at our hospital. The following day, renal function further worsened with a Cr level of 4.1 mg/dL, and the patient was hospitalized on an emergency basis for detailed testing and treatment.\nHe had no notable medical history and no constitutional jaundice. The patient’s older sister was reported to have hypouricemia, but the UA level was unknown. He also had no history of allergy and was a non-smoker and an occasional drinker.

The blood test results revealed renal function damage, hyperbilirubinemia in indirect bilirubin dominance, slight increase in C-reactive protein level, elevated fibrinogen levels, slight increases in creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels, and hypouricemia. However, no data could be found suggestive of a collagen disease or vascular disease, and there were no findings indicative of hemolysis without anemia and elevated LDH.\nThe urine test results did not reveal any abnormal urinary findings. There were no urinary microscopic evidence, tubular epithelial cells, granular cast, epithelial cell cast, uric acid crystals, microscopic hematuria, and eosinophiluria. However, there were aciduria and mild elevation in myoglobin, whereas tubular injury markers were almost normal. Prerenal failure was suggested by a fractional excretion of sodium (FENA) level of 0.61, and fractional excretion of UA (FEUA) was markedly elevated at a level of 50.5%. CT examination revealed bilateral renal swelling, but there were no hepatobiliary structural abnormalities and no other abnormal findings. Contrast-enhanced CT was not performed because of the renal dysfunction. Instead, renal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and the T2-weighted image showed a cuneiform low-signal area suggestive of heterogeneous ischemia (Fig. a, b).\nFor the differential diagnosis, medical history was gathered, and laboratory investigations were conducted. There had been no issues during growth and development; the patient had never experienced any liver injury, and bilirubin levels had been within the normal range at every yearly health check. There was no past history of fatty liver, viral hepatitis, or congenital liver disease. Furthermore, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibody, and hepatitis C virus antibody are all negative. No chronic liver injury, neurological injury, or urinary abnormalities were detected. Based on these findings, Fanconi syndrome and Wilson’s disease were excluded. No inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, malignant tumors, diabetes, or diarrhea was detected. The patient did not receive NSAIDs, antihyperuricemics, herbal supplements, nephrotoxic drugs, or contrast agents. There were no hypotension, infection, or sepsis. Urinary microscopic evidence showed a lack of tubular injury, and tubular injury markers were almost normal; these findings were negative for ATN. Low FENA suggested prerenal acute failure. However, the patient blood pressure was normotensive, and the oral mucous membrane and skin turgor were normal. There was no body weight loss compared to his usual weight, and dehydration was absent. Moreover, the state of the patient fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ALPE []. Based on the findings of renal failure and loin pain after exercise, minor elevation in CK and myoglobin, hypouricemia, and increase in FEUA as well as the MRI findings of bilateral renal swelling and cuneiform low-signal areas, we made a diagnosis of RHUC and ALPE. At that time, the cause of hyperbilirubinemia was unknown.\nThe patient’s progress was favorable, and he was kept under observation while undergoing bed rest, fluid replacement, and nutrition therapy. On day 4, the Cr level had improved to 3.4 mg/dL, and the patient was discharged on day 5. One month later, his renal function had recovered, with a Cr level of 0.98 mg/dL, and bilirubin levels also normalized to 0.9 mg/dL. However, the UA level was 0.8 mg/dL, indicating severe RHUC. This progress is shown in Table . Considering the patient’s familial history of RHUC, we performed genetic testing using next-generation sequencing at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. We performed comprehensive genetic analysis, including that for SLC22A12 encoding URAT1 and SLC2A9 encoding GLUT9, which are genes causing RHUC, and SLC34A1, EHHADH, HNF4A, and SLC2A2, which are genes causing Fanconi syndrome; however, the results could not identify the responsible mutation. Based on the patient’s family history, we considered the possibility of a new genetic mutation causing RHUC and considered exome sequencing (full genetic analysis). However, the patient’s family did not provide consent for genetic testing, and thus we were not able to identify the gene in question. To prevent ALPE, we advised the patient to avoid intense exercise; since then, ALPE has not recurred. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 27-year-old man with no medical history presented with headache since the morning and increasing nausea and drowsiness during the day. He became progressively confused in the late afternoon after which his partner consulted a doctor. On arrival at the emergency department he had an epileptic seizure with spontaneous recovery. Neurological and physical examination were unremarkable. Clinically he was euvolemic. CT head showed diffuse sulcal effacement without signs of haemorrhage, basilar artery thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or an intracranial tumour. Venous blood gas analysis, taken minutes after the seizure, showed a pH of 6.89, Pco2 10.8 kPa, bicarbonate 15.4 mmol/L, base excess −19.4 mmol/L and a lactate of 18.0 mmol/L. Blood chemistry was remarkable for sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 82 mmol/L, albumin 51 g/L and an osmolality of 278 mOsmol/kg. The urine toxicology test was positive for acetaminophen but negative for opiates, amphetamines and cocaine. He was then treated with ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone awaiting the results of the lumbar puncture but the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\nThis prompted us to reconsider the laboratory results. Patients relatively high haematocrit (0.48 L/L), together with the increased albumin level, were suggestive for haemoconcentration. However, we realised that measurements were done in a venous blood sample, which may have been ‘haemoconcentrated’ by water influx into the muscles during rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, we suggested that his arterial sodium concentration could well be lower, possibly low enough to explain the seizure. And indeed, in an arterial blood gas analysis taken 45 min after the seizure, the plasma sodium level was 118 mmol/L. Analysis of this hyponatremia revealed a urine sodium level of <20 mmol/L and an osmolality of 92 mOsmol/kg. He was diagnosed with primary polydipsia (the polyuria explaining the relatively low urine sodium concentration) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the first hours after admission his urine production was over 1 L/hour and the plasma sodium level rapidly increased to 128 mmol/L.\nAfter regaining consciousness he told he had been drinking an excessive amount of water extra throughout the day (4–5 L) because he thought that his headache was caused by dehydration. He further explained that he was living a healthy lifestyle in which drinking ample amounts of water played a central role. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

She mentioned multiple hospitalizations due chronic idiopathic pancreatitis between 12 and 16 years of age. At that time, laboratory tests ruled out the presence of gallstones, tumors, autoimmune diseases, or metabolic diseases. Her pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions were completely normal after each episode. Fifteen years after the last episode of pancreatitis, she presented with alopecia, malar rash, and oral ulcers. She was initially diagnosed as having discoid lupus with the skin biopsy results. However, a week later, she developed severe neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, including focal motor seizures, with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of 18 points. Rheumatologists prescribed methylprednisolone (three doses of 1 g daily by intravenous injection) with improvement of neurological symptoms. Her treatment at hospital discharge was: chloroquine (225 mg/day), levetiracetam (1.5 g twice a day), phenytoin (100 mg twice a day), lorazepam (1 mg/day), and a monthly bolus of CY. In addition, she was treated with weekly down-titrating doses of prednisone (initial dose of 1 mg/kg).\nSeven days after administration of the sixth dose of CY (cumulative dose of 6.25 g), she presented with asthenia, adynamia, polydipsia, nausea and vomiting, food intolerance, impaired visual acuity, and abdominal pain. The physical examination at our ED revealed tachycardia (125 beats per minute), tachypnea (27 breaths per minute), drowsiness, and dehydration. She presented with a normal body mass index and no stigmata associated with insulin resistance. Laboratory tests reported: serum glucose of 1240 mg/dl, sodium of 127 mEq/L, potassium of 5.56 mEq/L, chlorine of 86 mEq/L, arterial pH of 7.07, bicarbonate of 3.00 mmol/L, and ketonuria (80 mg/dl) with effective serum osmolarity of 322.8 mOsm/kg and total osmolarity of 334.1 mOsm/kg, with an anion gap of 43.56, urea 63 mg/dl, and creatinine of 1.58 mg/dl. Liver tests, amylase, and lipase were normal. After the diagnosis of a mixed hyperglycemic state with predominance of severe DKA, she was started on an aggressive intravenously administered fluid schedule with saline solution 0.9% and intravenous continuous insulin infusion (CII). During the first day she required a total of 165 units of insulin per day (2.75 U/kg per day). Table shows the clinical and biochemical evolution from first evaluation to resolution of DKA.\nDuring the first hours, traditional precipitant factors for DKA, such as infections or cardiac ischemia were ruled out. With an aliquot from the first serum sample in the ED, we measured anti-insulin, anti-GAD65, and anti-IA2 antibodies that were reported as negative; C-peptide was determined to be 0.5 ng/ml and the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 12.0%. The diagnostic consideration was of T1DM, so once DKA remission was achieved, she was prescribed an intensive insulin scheme at a dose of 1.09 IU/kg per day with 70% of basal insulin glargine daily and 30% of lispro boluses divided in three doses.\nWith the multi-drug immunosuppressive treatment her symptoms improved and 3 months after discharge the CY was switched to azathioprine and then to chloroquine. Three weeks after the switch from CY to other immunosuppressive therapies, she presented with symptomatic hypoglycemia and insulin doses were tapered down. Five months after the switch, insulin was completely withdrawn. At last follow up, 1 year after the hyperglycemic crisis, she had no symptoms related to hyperglycemia and her blood glucose remains under 100 mg/dl. She continues to have a well-balanced, low-carbohydrate diet and her last HbA1c was 5.2% and C-peptide was 1.8 ng/ml without any antidiabetic drugs. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",

She was slightly dehydrated but not severely ill looking. On physical examination, her belly was very soft and there was no abdominal tenderness. The hemoglobin was 12.9 g/dL and other laboratory findings including amylase, lipase, and liver profile were within normal range. Simple abdomen revealed a 3 cm sized soft tissue density near the pylorus without small bowel obstruction (). We checked computed tomography and noticed a well demarcated mass near the ampulla of Vater in the 2nd portion of duodenum (). Ultrasonography and upper gastrointestinal series revealed a polypoid mass with short stalk in the 2nd portion of duodenum ( and ). We attempted endoscopic examination and removal. However, the lumen was nearly obstructed by the mass and the stalk was too broad and hard to excise. We therefore decided on surgical resection. On laparotomy, we could palpate the mass after Kocher's maneuver. It was an approximately 3 cm well-demarcated mass broadly attached to duodenal wall. We opened the anti-mesenteric side of duodenum. The base of mass was attached to mesenteric side of duodenum just above the ampulla of Vater (). We completely removed the mass without injury of ampulla of Vater and pancreas parenchyma. The duodenotomy was closed transversely with a single-layer absorbable suture. The patient could take sips of water after 3 days of operation and recovered uneventfully. Pathologically, there were multifocal scattered nodular lesions, up to 0.3×0.2 cm in diameter in the submucosa and muscularis propria (hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] stain, ×40 or ×100). Microscopically nodular lesions were composed of variably dilated ductular mucinous and pancreatic exocrine acinar tissue (H&E, ×200).

Her past medical and surgical history was only significant for one undocumented episode of seizure at the age of three and appendectomy 3 years before. On interview, she denied fear of weight gain, laxative abuse, and self-induced vomiting. Her parents were consanguineous. There was no history of sibling loss or any similar symptoms in other family members.\nClinical examination revealed a cachectic lady with external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, right lower quadrant scar of the McBurney (oblique) incision for appendectomy, decreased muscle power in the upper (4/5 MRC muscle scale) and lower (3/5 MRC muscle scale) extremities, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Abdominopelvic sonography revealed mild free fluid in the abdominal cavity and increased thickness in the bowel wall (4.8 mm) and a 16 × 11-mm cortical cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney with thin septation. A diagnostic esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy showed diffuse severe erythema and congestion in the body, fundus, and antrum of the stomach with moderate chronic gastritis in pathologic examination and deformity of the duodenal bulb with decreased folds in D2 part of the duodenum. On colonoscopy, the ileocecal valve was stenotic; biopsy revealed submucosal fibrosis with lymphoid proliferation and focal ulceration. Echocardiography was normal except for mild pericardial effusion.\nHer complete blood count indicated the presence of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Biochemistry revealed low total protein level (4.1 g/dl; reference range: 6.6–8.8 g/dl) and albumin (2.2 g/dl; reference range: 3.5–5.2 g/dl). Serum lactate level (35.3 mg/dl; reference range: 4.5–19.8 mg/dl) was elevated. Fecal occult blood test was positive with moderately elevated fecal calprotectin level (58.5 μg/g; reference range: < 15 μg/g) suggestive for the inflammatory process. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed marked elevation of protein level (122 mg/dl; reference range: 15–45 mg/dl). Serology tests for HIV, HBV, and HCV were negative. Serum anti-tissue trans-glutaminase antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anti-coagulants, β2 microglobulin, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), C-ANCA, and P-ANCA were also within the normal limits. Serum levels of complement factors were also found to be altered: C3 level (65 mg/dl; reference range: 90–180 mg/dl) was decreased; C4 level (11.4 mg/dl; reference range: 10–40 mg/dl) was within the lower limit of the normal range. Blood TP activity was not measured for lack of laboratory resources.\nThe electrodiagnostic evaluation showed a neurogenic pattern on needle electromyography (EMG), conduction block in sensory nerves, and decreased compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in motor nerves with decreased conduction velocity and prolonged F-wave latency. Brain MRI with contrast showed leukoencephalopathy with diffusely increased T2 signal intensity in both cerebral hemispheres white matter. Hypersignal intensity in splenium of corpus callosum was also observed (Fig. ).\nAfter obtaining informed consent, a blood sample was obtained from the patient. The whole blood sample was collected in EDTA tube. Genomic DNA was then extracted from peripheral leukocytes using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nWhole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on Illumina NextSeq500 instrument to a sequence close to 100 million reads. WES result was then analyzed using different bioinformatics tools and databases such as BWA aligner, GATK and ANNOVAR [–]. WES uncovered a novel, private, homozygous stopgain mutation in TYMP gene (NM_001113756: exon7: c. 1013C > A: p.S338X, Chr: 50526392).\nSubsequently in order to confirm this novel mutation using Sanger sequencing, the region of interest was amplified using PCR on the DNA of the proband using following primers: F–TYMP-E7: 5′-ACTTAAGGGACCTGGTCACCAC-3′ and R–TYMP-E7: 5′-AGCCTCTGACCCACGTCGA-3′ (PCR product: 594 bp). Then, the amplicon was sequenced with both forward and reverse primers using ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems®, USA). Sanger sequencing result was analyzed by NCBI BLAST () and CodonCode Aligner (). Sanger sequencing confirmed this mutation as homozygous in the proband (Fig. ).\nThis mutation has not been reported yet in main variant databases and our public database (Bayangene).

In a chest radiograph done under the suspicion of an upper respiratory infection, a round foreign object with a diameter of 21 mm was detected in the upper esophagus (). In a sleep endoscopy, it was confirmed to be a circular battery (), and ingestion was estimated to occur three days prior to the hospital visit, and it was determined that endoscopic removal would not be easy. Therefore, it was decided to immediately remove the battery under general anesthesia.\nThe infant had no underlying disease, and glycopyrrolate 0.05 mg was IM injected 30 minutes before arriving at the operating room as premedication for the anesthesia. The infant was monitored by ECG, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and a pulse oximetry, and before anesthesia, her blood pressure was 85/61 mmHg; her heart rate was 160 beats/min with 100% oxygen saturation. 10 mg of Ketamine was IV injected and after loss of consciousness, 5 mg of Rocunium was IV injected. When the muscles were sufficiently relaxed, an uncuffed endotracheal tube with a 4 mm inside diameter was intubated. After intubation, both lungs were checked through a stethoscope and found to be normal, and the endotracheal tube was set to 11 cm in accordance with the top front teeth. Anesthesia was maintained by 2 L/min of air, 2 L/min of O2, and 2.0-3.5 vol% of sevoflurane. The tidal volume was 90 ml; respiratory rate was 18/min through volume-controlled mechanical ventilation to maintain an end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) pressure of 35-40 mmHg and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at this point was 19 cmH2O.\nAn adult endoscope with a 9 mm outer diameter was used for the removal procedure because the hospital did not have a pediatric endoscope with forceps. 2 minutes after inserting the endoscope, severe abdominal inflation was observed, and PIP increased up to 28-30 cmH2O with the tidal volume decreasing to less than 50 ml. The battery had caused an inflammatory change and conglutinated onto surrounding tissue in the esophagus, and 3 minutes after inserting the endoscope, oxygen saturation decreased to 80%, and EtCO2 pressure rose to 70 mmHg therefore the surgery was stopped and the endoscope was removed. By manual ventilation using 100% oxygen, oxygen saturation was recovered to 100% and EtCO2 pressure to 40 mmHg, and thereafter, the endoscope was reinserted.\nIn the second attempt of the procedure, manual ventilation was done instead of mechanical ventilation. However, 1 minute after the insertion of the endoscope, a sudden strong resistance was felt in the reservoir bag, and the tidal volume was less than 20 ml despite applying more than 35 cmH2O for the PIP. Oxygen saturation dropped below 60% so the procedure could not be continued; therefore, the endoscope was removed again. Here, a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained. The endoscope was reinserted after recovering oxygen saturation to 100%, but due to the increased airway pressure, ventilation was not possible, and oxygen saturation dropped back down to less than 40%. The authors suspected the possibility of TEF considering the period of intake and the excessive air volume seen in the stomach in the chest radiograph taken before the surgery. Hence, the endotracheal tube was inserted until one lung ventilation was possible and then retreated while auscultating to secure onto the location where the pulmonary sound from both lungs became equal. The adjusted position of the endotracheal tube was 15 cm based on the top front teeth. A PIP of 25-30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 80-100 ml were maintained. In the next insertion of the endoscope, A PIP of 30 cmH2O and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained but abdominal inflation was excessive so air in the stomach was partially removed with the endoscope, and the operating doctor was required to use the minimal amount of air for the surgery to proceed. A PIP of 25-30 cmH2O, a tidal volume of 50-80 ml, and oxygen saturation of 100% were maintained during the procedure, and the battery was removed.\nAfter the removal of the battery, the vital signs were blood pressure 96/69 mmHg, heart rate 152 beats/min, and 100% oxygen saturation. The patient was not extubated but moved to postoperative intensive care, and after pediatrics observed vital signs for about 3 hours to verify that there were no abnormalities, extubation was done. Subsequent vital sign checks and physical exam were normal, and there were no abnormalities found in the blood test. Moreover, the right main bronchus appeared on the screen in the postoperative esophagography (), and the chest CT scan found TEF at 1.4 cm in the upper carina ().

Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose were also within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) was < 10 mg/L, which is also normal. The owner did not want additional examinations or treatments other than excision of the tumour and for this reason, a thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasound, and a full haematological profile were not performed. No systemic treatment was initiated, and 2 months after surgery an unremarkable full haematological profile was obtained. 19 months after the diagnosis the dog was still alive and doing well with no signs of relapse.\nThe specimen was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after surgical excision, processed and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 µm) were prepared and stained with haematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols. Furthermore, sections were routinely stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Gram stain, and Gomori’s methenamine silver stain (GMS) to detect microorganisms. Giemsa staining was performed to visualize the blood derived cells in the specimen.\nImmunohistochemical stainings were performed on a Ventana Benchmark Ultra Platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The following antibodies were used: CD3 [clone 2GV6, code 790-4341, rabbit anti-human, ready-to-use (RTU), Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], PAX-5 [clone SP34, code 790-4420, rabbit anti-human, RTU, Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], vimentin [clone V9, code 790-2917, mouse anti-human, RTU, Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, code M724001, mouse anti-human, 1:100, Dako). Positive and negative controls were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "8.284",
    "Upper Limit": "9.156",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL). The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 31.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 31.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.1 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 31.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 3.1 g Albmumin/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 2.43 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 2.43 mmol. To convert 2.43 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.43 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.08 g Calcium. To convert 0.08 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.08 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 80.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 80.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 8.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 2.43 mmol Calcium/L converts to 8.0 mg Calcium/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.1 g/dL)) + 8.0 mg/dL = 8.72 mg/dL. The patient's corrected calcium concentration 8.72 mg/dL.",

She was a restrained driver in the crash and denied losing consciousness. Her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 15. She reported abdominal pain and had abrasions over her left clavicle and lower abdomen in a seatbelt sign pattern, contusions over her right thigh and left hip and a laceration over her right knee revealing the joint. CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, and small foci of air was seen under the diaphragm which was indicative for small bowel perforation. A CT Scan of the head without IV contrast revealed no acute processes, including intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral contusions. The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy and irrigation and debridement of the right lower extremity.\nThe patient’s prior past medical history was significant for hypothyroidism and medications prescribed were Synthroid 88 mg once daily. The patient reported that she was compliant with her medication. She denied any hypertension, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, neurological or substance use history. The patient had a normal sinus rhythm and a normal ECG with all intervals within normal limits.\nOn anesthesia pre-operative exam, the patient’s vital signs were within normal limits. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a perforation in the jejunum and a tear in the mesentery followed by an irrigation and debridement for the open laceration in the right knee. Intraoperatively, the patient’s vitals fluctuated. The patient’s blood pressure ranged from 80 to 140/ 38 to 69 mmHg. The heart rate ranged from 79 to 125 beats per minute (bpm). The patient received 160mcg of phenylephrine at induction,and received 10 mg of ephedrine and 240mcg of phenylephrine when her blood pressure dropped to 90/39 mmHg.\nIn recovery, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 93/71 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an O2 saturation of 96% on room air. The patient’s vital signs were monitored continuously in the post anesthesia care unit. On discharge from the recovery room, her vitals were as follows: blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, 98 bpm, 18 breaths per minute with a 96% O2 saturation on room air.\nThe patient’s hospital course was prolonged due to a tarsometatarsal fracture which required an open reduction internal fixation. Preoperatively, the patient’s vitals were as follows: blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, 16 breaths per minute and saturating 94% on room air. Intraoperatively, the patient’s vital signs fluctuated, with her blood pressure ranging from 85 to 150/41 to 78 mmHg. Her heart rate ranged from 60 to 130 bpm. The patient received 80mcg of phenylephrine when her blood pressure dropped to 85/42 mmHg.\nIn recovery, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 135/77 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an O2 saturation of 96% on room air. The patient’s vital signs were monitored continuously in the post anesthesia care unit. Her vitals were blood pressure of 123/74 mmHg, 89 beats per minute, 17 breaths per minute with a 96% O2 saturation on room air prior to discharge from the recovery room.\nDuring her stay, her vital signs were within normal limits with the exception of episodes of sinus tachycardia as high as 119. The patient’s blood pressure was well controlled, and her systolic pressure never was higher than 140.\nOn post exploratory laparotomy day 3, the patient developed a headache and visual changes manifesting as central blurriness. Ophthalmology was consulted and attributed the cause of visual changes to macular edema. No intervention was recommended due to their belief that it would resolve on its own. The headache and visual disturbances persisted through day 7 and now progressed to right sided hemianopsia. An MRI of the brain, MRA of the head without contrast and MRA of the neck with contrast were ordered to rule out stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. The MRA of the head and neck showed no findings, however the MRI brain showed some patchy T2 areas and diffusion hyperintensity in the periphery of both occipital lobes and adjacent cerebellar hemispheres. These hyperintensities extended superiorly on the right side into the parieto-occipital junction while the left hyperintensity appeared to spread more inferiorly and laterally (See\n). These findings were consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.\nOver the next 3 days, the patient received an open reduction internal fixation for the tarsometatarsal fracture and was discharged to rehabilitation. The patient reports that her hemianopsia resolved in mid-July of 2018. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

The patient’s medical history included uterine cervical cancer for which surgical treatment was performed at the age of 45 and gastric cancer treated by total gastrectomy at the age of 55. Medical history did not include renal biopsy, renal injury, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or no trauma at the flank region. On admission, blood pressure was 143/67 mmHg, heart rate was 83 beats/min, body temperature was 37.2°C, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. On clinical examination, weight was 45 kg, height was 143 cm, and body mass index was 22.0 kg/m2. Inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva revealed evidence of anemia. Blood chemical analyses were shown in Table . A urinalysis revealed urine protein level of 3+, urine occult blood level of 3+, white blood cell count of 10–19/HPF, and red blood cell count of >100/HPF. Plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed dilated left renal pelvis with high-density contents and hematoma was suspected (Figure A, B). Contrast enhanced CT was not performed because this condition was not considered to have association with renal vascular diseases. Subsequent plain abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed left hydronephrosis and blood retention in the dilated left renal pelvis. No cancer in the renal pelvis or ureter was detected (Figure C).\nDespite conservative treatment with hemostatic agents (carbazochrome sodium sulphate and tranexamic acid), hematuria persisted. Repeated urinary cytology revealed no malignant cells. On day 9 after admission, consciousness deteriorated, systolic blood pressure decreased to 60 mmHg, and a high-grade fever of 39.0°C developed. Laboratory blood tests revealed a markedly elevated white blood cell count (35,000/μL), markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (32.5 mg/dL), and moderate anemia (red blood cell count, 206 × 104/μL; hemoglobin, 6.0 g/dL). The patient went into septic and/or hemorrhagic shock. Therefore, fluid and catecholamine infusion, blood transfusion, and antibacterial drugs were rapidly initiated. Consciousness level and circulatory condition gradually improved. Repeated blood culture prior to administration of antibacterial drugs revealed no evidence of bacterial infection. On day 10 after admission, abdominal ultrasonography revealed expansion of hematoma in the left renal pelvis. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT confirmed marked expansion of hematoma in the left renal pelvis and identified microaneurysms in the segmental arteries of the left kidney (Figure A, B).\nInflammation improved and a left double-J stent was inserted to improve hydronephrosis. Selective renal angiography that was simultaneously performed revealed renal arteriovenous malformation with microaneurysms in the left segmental arteries (Figure A). Catheter embolization using metallic coils was then successfully performed (Figure ); thus, hematuria ceased. Subsequent plain abdominal CT confirmed the absence of hematoma in the left renal pelvis (Figure A). Abdominal radiography revealed a well-positioned double-J stent (Figure B). The subsequent clinical course was uneventful. No postembolization syndrome (fever, lumbago, elevation of lactase dehydrogenase, or hematuria) was observed.

Her physical exam was notable for fullness and tenderness to palpation of the abdominal left upper quadrant. Laboratory testing was notable for a normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL and normal iron studies. Her white blood cell count, liver function tests, and lipase were within normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed severe dilation of the stomach, with thickening of the pylorus and duodenal bulb consistent with gastric outlet obstruction of the excluded stomach (). Per-oral single-balloon enteroscopy was performed and revealed a normal gastric pouch and gastrojejunal anastomosis, but was unable to reach the excluded stomach because of sharp angulations of the small bowel, probably due to abdominal adhesions.\nThe patient was evaluated by the surgical service, who deemed her a poor surgical candidate for laparoscopic exploration. An ultrasound-guided 12-French (Fr) gastrostomy tube was placed percutaneously by interventional radiology into the excluded stomach for decompression of the gastric outlet obstruction of the excluded stomach. In subsequent months, upsizing of the gastrostomy tube tract was performed until a 24-Fr tube was in place. She then underwent endoscopic evaluation under moderate sedation using a pediatric gastroscope (EVIS EXERA III GIF-XP190N gastroscope) with an outer diameter of 5.4 mm. For this procedure, carbon dioxide was used for insufflation but no trocar was used. The patient’s existing 24-Fr gastrostomy tube was deflated and easily removed through the tract. A guidewire was coiled into the excluded stomach under endoscopic guidance. The pediatric gastroscope was advanced alongside the guidewire into the excluded stomach. A large, friable, ulcerated mass () was identified and multiple biopsies were taken, later identified as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring and mucinous features consistent with primary gastrointestinal malignancy. After removal of the gastroscope, a new 24-Fr gastrostomy tube was advanced without difficulty into the excluded tract and its position was confirmed via injection of contrast through the tube. She was deemed a poor surgical and chemotherapy candidate, eventually passing away in a hospice. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

He had become infected with HIV about 10 years earlier and had been followed at our outpatient clinic since 7 years prior to the current presentation. He had never had hyperglycemia during follow-up. Upon arrival, he stated that he was in his usual state of health and denied any symptoms such as polydipsia or polyuria, except for weight loss, but he did not recall the precise amount of weight loss or its duration. He stated that he was an occasional binge drinker of alcohol but denied any alcohol intake since 1 month prior to the current presentation. His height was 162 cm, and his weight was 42.8 kg. His physical examination was unremarkable, and he did not have any bodily habitus to suggest lipodystrophy. His past medical history, besides HIV infection, included depression, multiple alcohol binge-drinking periods with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and two episodes of amoebic liver abscess. His medications included Combivir® (zidovudine and lamivudine; ViiV Healthcare, Brentford, UK), raltegravir, and fenofibrate. He was seen by a psychiatrist and had received sertraline, levomepromazine, flunitrazepam, and quazepam, but he had discontinued all medications approximately 1 month prior to the current presentation after discussion with his psychiatrist. He denied tobacco use, illicit drug use, or use of any supplements. He had been taking Combivir® (zidovudine and lamivudine) and KALETRA® (lopinavir/ritonavir; AbbVie, Chicago, IL, USA) for several years, but KALETRA® was switched to atazanavir/ritonavir because of an interaction with psychiatric medications 6 years ago. They were again changed to raltegravir 4 years ago because of hypertriglyceridemia. With ART consisting of Combivir® and raltegravir, the patient’s HIV infection had been stable, with a latest CD4+ T lymphocyte count being 1065/mm3 and an undetectable viral load (Table ).\nBlood tests done on the day of the current presentation showed elevated glucose of 31.8 mmol/L, sodium 130 mmol/L, and potassium 4.3 mmol/L, with mildly elevated liver transaminases. The patient’s hemoglobin A1c was 8.5%. His arterial blood gas analysis on room air showed a pH of 7.404, partial pressure of oxygen of 115 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 36.8 mmHg, bicarbonate of 22.5 mmol/L, and an anion gap of 11.5 mmol/L (Table ).\nBecause of the patient’s hyperglycemia without acidosis, we presumptively diagnosed that he had newly developed diabetes mellitus and considered the possibility of insulin depletion as a result of repeated acute pancreatitis. We then referred him to our endocrinology clinic. Additional blood tests were ordered, and it turned out that his blood C-peptide level was 2.69 ng/ml (normal range 0.69–2.45 ng/ml), his blood insulin level was 15 μU/ml (normal range 5–30 μU/ml), and his glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody level was 0.6 U/ml (normal range 0–1.49 U/ml). Unlike our initial assessment, we then judged him to have diabetes mellitus with preserved insulin secretion from the pancreas, and he was prescribed glimepiride 1 mg once daily. Sitagliptin 50 mg once daily and metformin 250 mg twice daily were added later, and his hyperglycemia normalized with a decreasing hemoglobin A1c level. A computed tomographic scan of the patient’s abdomen with contrast did not show any evidence of chronic pancreatitis, but it showed sporadic low-density areas in the liver, suggesting partial fatty liver.\nBy this time, we began to suspect the antiretroviral medications, particularly zidovudine, as the cause of the patient’s diabetes. Combivir® was switched to TRUVADA® (tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine; Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) 4 months after the detection of diabetes mellitus. His hyperglycemia further improved, and his medications for diabetes were decreased. Seven months after the patient’s initial presentation, all diabetes medications were stopped.

On examination, she was afebrile, pulse rate was 90 beats min–1, respiratory rate was mildly increased at 22 breaths min–1 and blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. On auscultation of the chest, fine rales over the right lung base were noted. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count at 7300 cells l–1 (3.5–11 × 109 cells l–1), C-reactive protein 14 mg l–1 (< 5 mg l–1) and haemoglobin 100 g l–1 (110–165 g l–1). Her initial chest X-ray showed an opacity in the right lower lobe (RLL) contiguous with the right hemidiaphragm (). A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a 2.8 cm solid enhancing nodule in the posterobasal segment of the RLL with a density measuring 35 HU, with a 7 mm central focus of dense calcification (); also noted were hyperdense endobronchial material in the RLL, which was thought to represent fresh blood. A suspicion of lung cancer was raised, especially in view of heavy smoking history and reported weight loss. Positron emission tomography revealed increased 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5] within the RLL nodule; the report described the finding as concerning for malignancy, with the differential diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumour (). A subsequent bronchoscopy was complicated owing to active bleeding from the RLL bronchus. The transbronchial biopsy showed no malignant cells, acid-fast bacilli or fungi.\nUpon targeted questioning, the patient disclosed having had a complicated cholecystectomy 3 years ago, performed at another hospital, with attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted into an open laparotomy owing to gallbladder rupture with intraperitoneal spillage of gallstones; this was complicated by the formation of post-operative subphrenic abscess, which was surgically drained. The relevant externally performed images have been retrieved, including a CT scan of the abdomen (). The patient further admitted to occasional episodes of minor haemoptysis of about two spoonfuls over the past 2 years, associated with right-sided mild chest pain, which she did not seek medical attention for.\nAs the RLL mass was the presumed cause for the repeated episodes of haemoptysis, a thoracotomy was recommended and the patient underwent a RLL wedge resection. A firm rhomboid-shaped calculus measuring 11 × 7 × 8 mm () that dislodged from the specimen was confirmed to be a gallstone. Pathological examination additionally found abundant bile pigment (25%) surrounded by microorganisms, extensive interstitial fibrosis and hyalinization. Further biochemical analysis of the calculus revealed the presence of 85% cholesterol.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 58 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 183.0 cm, which is 183.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.83 m. The patient's weight is 80.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 80.0 kg / (1.83 m * 1.83 m) = 23.888 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.9, indicating they are normal weight. Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 77.708 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 58) * 77.708 * 1) / (1.0 * 72) = 88.501 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 88.501 mL/min.",

The neoplasm infiltrated tunica serosa without lymph node infiltration or metastasis. The FLOT regimen was administered as a neoadjuvant treatment to prepare for the surgical procedure of removal of the lesion. She had received a unique dose of chemotherapy 2 months before admission. Chemotherapy was complicated by infectious pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae) leading to septic shock, treated with intravenous infusion of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, with acute renal failure requiring dialysis. For this reason, the chemotherapy was interrupted after administration. She had a personal history of arterial hypertension, vena cava and iliac deep vein thrombosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and blindness in the right eye. She was taking amiodarone, acetylsalicylic acid, tinzaparin, hydralazine, and lorazepam, but she was not taking any treatment for COPD.\nOn admission, blood pressure was 136/76 mmHg, weight 58.9 kg, height 1.63 m, heart rate 92 pulse/minute, body temperature 36.0°C, and capillary blood glucose 136 mg/dl. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed visual loss in the left eye and weakness of the lower limbs. Blood tests showed normal values of sodium and magnesium. Lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was slightly increased, and albumin level was slightly decreased.\nBrain computed tomography (CT) showed two ischemic-like occipital lesions without hemorrhage (). Angiographic sequences revealed breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in the corresponding regions. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated bilateral parieto-occipital lesions: most parts of the lesions were T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity, which demonstrated vasogenic edema. The rest of the parts of the lesions were T1 hyperintensity, T2 hyperintensity, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity, which might indicate cortical laminar necrosis. After gadolinium injection, a linear enhancement of the cortex was observed. Multiple micro-ischemic lesions were observed in the periventricular regions, indicating a background of chronic ischemic leukoencephalopathy. No lesion was demonstrated in the posterior fossa. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI was not performed. MRI angiographic sequences did not show any abnormality in the vertebrobasilar system or in Willis polygon (). In particular, there was no evidence of vasospasm.\nLumbar puncture was not performed in our patient owing to absence of clinical evidence of infectious meningitis.

Awake craniotomy with iMRI was scheduled because the tumour was located in the left superior and middle frontal gyri.\nGeneral anaesthesia was induced. Following left frontal craniotomy and dural incision, the first iMRI was performed (Fig. ). One hundred fifty-eight minutes from induction, the patient regained consciousness after all anaesthetics were ceased. Tumour resection was performed with free conversation. However, after 143 min of surgery under the awake condition, the patient came to complain of excessive sleepiness though she could respond to verbal commands. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) did not detect after-discharge. The tumour was successfully removed en bloc fashion. Progressive brain swelling was not observed.

    "problem": "<Context> A 22-year-old female was referred to our endocrine clinic with 2-year history of gradually progressive proximal muscle pain and weakness involving both upper and lower extremities. Her pediatrician had treated her with prednisone for a period of two months without any improvement. MRI of pelvis and thighs completed before her referral had shown linear hypointense foci in both proximal medial femoral necks and the right ischium consistent with insufficiency fractures. She had a normal childhood development and pubertal growth and at presentation had a height of 154cm and a body weight of 57.1kg. There was no reported family history of rickets, osteomalacia, or any other metabolic bone disease. Her menstrual history was unremarkable.\nPast medical history was significant for a diagnosis of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT2) deficiency at the age of 14 which was diagnosed in the context of a work-up for diffuse muscle pain and weakness. At that time, she was evaluated in the Neurology clinic and was found to have low serum carnitine levels, elevated serum alanine, normal lactate, and low pyruvate levels. C16, C18:2, C18:1, and C18 levels were elevated suggesting carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency. However, genetic testing was negative for the S113L variant. Results of other biochemical testing at that time were not available in her medical records. Her symptoms had reportedly completely resolved a few months after she was started on oral carnitine replacement therapy.\nPhysical exam did not show any apparent kyphosis or scoliosis of spine, vertebral tenderness, or hyperextensibility of joints. There were no lower extremity deformities. She had proximal muscle weakness with 4/5 strength in upper and 3/5 in the lower extremities. There was tenderness in the thighs. Her neurological exam was otherwise normal. She had a waddling gait.\nLaboratory work-up revealed the following results: calcium, 9.1 (ref: 8.6-10.2 mg/dl); phosphate level, 2.0 (ref: 2.5-4.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase, 243 (ref: 39-136 Units/L); bone specific alkaline phosphatase, 119.6 (ref: 0-21.3 mg/dl); 25-hydroxy vitamin D, 8.2 (ref: 30-100 ng/ml); and PTH, 145 (ref: 22-84 pg/ml). A bone density scan showed an abnormally low bone density matched for age, gender, and ethnicity with the lowest Z score of -3.3 at the left femoral neck. Vertebral fracture assessment score was within normal limits.\nA 24-hour urine collection revealed low calcium of 27.6 (ref: 100-300.0 mg/24 hr) and inappropriately normal urine phosphate excretion of 445 mg/dL (ref: 400.0-1300.0 mg/24 hr). Fractional excretion of phosphate was inappropriately normal at 19% (ref: 15–20%). Renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR) was low at 0.50 (ref: 3.18-6.41 for 16- to 25-year-old females). These results suggested renal phosphate wasting as a potential etiology for osteomalacia and we considered Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia (TIO) and Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets (HRR) as diagnostic possibilities. However, in the absence of any family history of rickets and her normal childhood growth and stature, rickets appeared to be less likely and subsequent work-up was directed at ruling out TIO. An Octreotide scan with SPECT imaging came back negative and was followed by F-18 FDG PET/CT scan, which too failed to reveal any tumor. However, an FGF-23 level was found to be elevated at 580 (ref: 44-215 RU/mL). The assay used is a second-generation C-terminal assay that measures both the intact FGF-23 and its C-terminal fragments. At this stage, following the negative localization studies for TIO, the patient was counseled on genetic testing to look for the possibility of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets. She consented for the genetic testing which revealed a heterozygous known pathogenic missense variant in FGF23: c.527 G>A p. Arg176Gln (R176Q) consistent with a diagnosis of “Autosomal Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets”.\nGenetic screens for variants in PHEX (X-linked Hypophosphatemic Rickets) and DMP-1 (Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets 1) were negative. These results were therefore consistent with a diagnosis of Autosomal Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ADHR) caused by a mutant FGF23. When we informed the patient about the genetic diagnosis, she did some further research regarding her family history and found out that her father's maternal aunt and grandfather had ‘bone disorder' and were wheelchair-bound in early adulthood but her mother remained in good health and had no symptoms\nShe was started on Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU weekly and was encouraged to increase her dietary calcium to 1000 mg daily. She was also prescribed Potassium-Sodium-Phosphate 250 mg (8 mmol) 4 times a day. She continued to have pain and discomfort in her inner thighs. She was prescribed Diclofenac and Flexeril for pain. MRI of the pelvis was repeated to follow up on the insufficiency fractures and showed persistent bilateral femoral stress insufficiency fractures (). She was referred to orthopedic surgery and underwent pinning of bilateral femoral necks. She had significant improvement in pain and discomfort in the right thigh and groin region but still had some discomfort in the left upper thigh.\nHer 25(OH)D levels normalized to 46.2 ng/ml as did her serum phosphate level (2.7 mg/dL) with oral replacement therapy.\nDue to persistent pain in her left groin, she was prescribed narcotic analgesics and underwent a steroid injection of the psoas muscle by orthopedics with no relief. A repeat X-ray of pelvis showed new insufficiency fractures of the left superior and inferior rami ().\nThe patient had difficulty adhering to the regimen of potassium-sodium-phosphate 250 mg (8 mmol) four times daily. Therefore, she was started on calcitriol 0.25 mcg once a day. The dose of calcitriol was gradually increased up to 2 mcg per day. The patient reported significant improvement in her pain after the introduction of calcitriol to her regimen.\nAlthough she missed a few follow-up appointments in the endocrine clinic, she was eventually seen a year later and reported feeling significantly better on the same treatment regimen of calcitriol 2 mcg daily, potassium-sodium-phosphate 250 mg (8 mmol) twice daily, vitamin D3 2000 units daily, and 600 mg of calcium supplement daily. She had complete resolution of her pain and was not on any pain medications. Her physical exam showed normal strength in the upper and lower extremities and no tenderness. Laboratory work-up at that time showed complete resolution of the previous abnormalities: serum phosphate level was 3.3 (ref: 2.5- 4.5 mg/dl); calcium, 9.4 (ref: 8.6-10.2 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase, 88 (ref: 39-136 units/l); and 25(OH)D, 44.6 (ref: 30-100 ng/ml). A repeat X-ray of pelvis showed resolution of the previous left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures.\nThe patient subsequently enrolled in a clinical trial of iron supplementation for patients with ADHR at another institution. Correspondence received from that institution showed a hemoglobin 10.1 (ref: 12-15.5 g/dl), hematocrit 31 (ref: 39.4-44.5%), MCV 78 (80-96 fL), platelets 313, 000 (ref: 150,000-400,000/ml), WBC 8.400 (ref: 4,000-11,000 ml), Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) 378 (ref: 240-450 mcg/dl), ferritin 6.4 (ref: 12-300 ng/ml), and percent iron saturation 3% (ref: 25-35%). These results are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The patient has not followed up with our endocrine clinic since then and we have not been able to reach her despite multiple attempts to obtain any update on her condition following iron supplementation trial. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 130.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 130.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 130.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 29.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 29.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 29.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 29.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 130.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 29.0 mEq/L) = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 1.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 1.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 1.0 - 12 = -11.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -11.0 mEq/L.",

She had no fever, headache, vomiting, bloody urine nor weakness of limbs.\nOn physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She weighed 37 kg, and height 147 cm (surface area of 1.2 m2). There was no pallor, no lymph adenopathy and no sign of malnutrition. External evaluation of the left eye revealed complete blindness with a mydriatic pupil that was non- responsive to light. Gastrointestinal examination revealed a circular scarification mark on the abdomen as well as a huge visible abdomino-pelvic mass measuring about 20 cm above the supra-pubic region (Fig. ). The mass was hard with irregular contours, fixed, moderately tender on palpation and extending to the epigastric region. She had no ascites. The liver, spleen and kidneys were non palpable. A non-tender left breast mass was also palpated, while her mouth, teeth and jaws were normal and likewise the rest of the systemic examination.\nA full blood count done revealed lymphocytosis (70%) with normal total white cell count and haemoglobin level of 10.2 mg/dl. She had negative test results for malaria and HIV and her urine analysis was normal. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed a huge hypoechoic abdominopelvic mass, with normal homogenous liver and spleen, while both kidneys had moderate hydronephrosis. Bone marrow aspirate revealed normal trilineage maturation with erythroid hyperplasia and negative for lymphoma or other malignancy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was negative for malignancy (lymphocytic pleocytosis). Fine needle aspiration of the tumour was done and histopathology analysis of sample showed no malignant cells. A CT scan and MRI were requested but not done due to financial constraints.\nDespite the negative bone marrow aspirate results, a presumptive diagnosis of Burkitt’s lymphoma was made based on the clinical picture and abdominal ultrasound findings. The patient was placed on the induction phase of the Burkitt’s lymphoma chemotherapy protocol as adapted from the Malawi 2003 protocol [].\nAs per this protocol the patient was due 3 pulses of cyclophosphamide and intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone on days 1, 8 and 15 while maintaining good hydration.\nFollowing initiation to treatment, and prior to day 8 (second day of chemotherapy), the breast and abdominal tumours had rapidly regressed. By the end of the induction phase, the left breast mass was no longer palpable though it still appeared bigger than the right whilst the abdomino-pelvic mass had reduced significantly to a small pelvic mass about 6 cm in diameter, non-tender, smooth and firm. The patient however remained blind on the left side. She was then placed on the intensification phase of the chemotherapy protocol. At the end of the chemotherapies, the right breast was now same size with the left, the abdominal mass had completely regressed (Fig. ) but with persistence of the blindness.\nAt 6 months follow-up, the primary disease was in remission but there was still blindness of the left eye. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

He had been a heavy smoker, but had never been diagnosed with hypertension. Laboratory data was as follows: white blood cell count 13150/µL; hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL; platelet count, 110×103/µL; serum urea nitrogen level, 32 mg/dL; and serum creatinine level, 3.11 mg/dL. His serum electrolyte levels were as follows: sodium, 120 mEq/L; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L; chloride, 80 mEq/L; calcium, 7.5 mg/dL; and phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria and proteinuria (+++). Total protein to creatinine ratio in spot urine was 6.08 mg/g. Pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was markedly increased. Chest radiograph () and computed tomography showed bilateral infiltration, suggesting alveolar hemorrhage. Renal ultrasound using a Doppler scan showed increased echogenicity in both normal-sized kidneys without renal artery stenosis. Goodpasture's syndrome, SLE, microscopic polyangiitis or PAN was strongly suspected.\nOn the second hospital day, his serum creatinine level increased to 4.65 mg/dL. Anti-nuclear antibody test was negative, complement levels were normal, plasma renin activity was 6.27 ng/L·s (reference, 0.28-0.69 ng/L·s), serum aldosterone level was 6.54 nmol/L (reference, 0.11-0.28 nmol/L), and serum parathyroid hormone level was 159.1 pg/mL (reference, 14-72 pg/mL). Peripheral blood smear (PBS) showed some helmet cells suggestive of micrcoangiopathic hemolysis. Fundoscopic examination showed cotton wool spots and splinter hemorrhage with papillary edema, consistent with hypertensive changes ().\nOn the third day, his serum creatinine level increased to 4.91 mg/dL. Steroid pulse therapy was administered because of a strong suspicion of immune-mediated pulmonary renal syndrome.\nA renal biopsy and bronchoscopy were promptly performed. Bronchoscopic examination showed mild hyperemia in both bronchi, with red bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Light microscopic examination of the renal biopsy showed proliferative endarteritis in interlobular arteries and fibrinoid necrosis and intramural thrombi of small arterioles without crescent formation or necrotizing lesions, consistent with hypertensive nephrosclerosis (). Steroid therapy was rapidly decreased and stopped. A trans-bronchial lung biopsy showed macrophage infiltration into alveolar spaces and goblet cell metaplasia in bronchial mucosa generally seen in heavy smokers. Vanillyl-mandelic acid, metanephrine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in 24-h urine samples were within normal levels. Tests for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative. An echocardiogram showed eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy with decreased systolic and diastolic dysfunctions and a dilated left atrium. In the further reports of the patient's renal biopsy, immunofluorescent studies showed fine granular deposition of C3 and C1q only within the vessel walls and electron microscopic examination showed focal effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes, focally swollen endothelial cell with irregularly thickened capillary basement membrane and normal mesangial basement membrane without deposition.\nHis serum creatinine level increased to 5.15 mg/dL on the fourth day, but he did not require dialysis. Serum creatinine level gradually decreased with strict blood pressure control and was 4.03 mg/dL at discharge.

Treatment was then suspended to allow a reevaluation of ovarian functionality. Upon drug withdrawal the patient presented secondary amenorrhea and was referred to our unit for an indepth diagnostic evaluation. A written informed consent was obtained.\nMedical history revealed that the patient was born with normal delivery, bottle-fed, and showed standard psychosomatic development, menarche at age of 13 and oligomenorrhea since then up until estroprogestinic therapy was established. Pelvic US demonstrated a normally placed and normally developed uterus with a slightly dishomogeneous structure. The ovaries were not visible.\nThe patient was also affected by autoimmune thyroiditis, treated with levotiroxin. Ten years earlier (2002) the patient received a diagnosis of lactotrophic microadenoma (PRL 125 ng/dL); brain MRI “dubious small area of enhancement in the lower right paramedian pituitary” and was treated with different dosages of cabergoline. This treatment was suspended in august 2010. In 2011 a brain MRI was substantially unmodified compared with with the previous one. In addition the patient reported myopia and arthralgia since she was 15 years old Family history showed familiarity for thyroid, neurological cardiovascular diseases (see pedigree: ).\nPhysical examination: height 158 cm (3°–25°p), weight 64 Kg (50°p), BMI 25,63 Kg/m2, waist circumference 92 cm, cranic, and upper and lower limb measurements between 50° and 75° percentile. No alterations detected in fingers and toes. Apparently a normal development was observed for secondary sex characteristics. Facial features revealed no dysmorphisms, moreover neither mental impairment or cognitive deficit was evident. Vital signs were normal.\nA blood sample was drawn in Sodium (Na) heparin coated tube (vacutainer) for mononuclear cells culture and GTG karyotyping. High-definition GTG banding analysis of 100 metaphases (Leica CW4000 software) demonstrated a 45,X (41%)/46,X,rea(X) (59%) mosaicism ().\nCBG staining of a new lymphocyte preparation demonstrated the presence of two centromeres in the X rearranged population [46,X,rea(X)] (). Finally FISH analysis (kit ToTelVysion (TM) Multicolor DNA probe mixtures (Vysis)), confirmed the presence of two X centomeres in rearranged X chromosomes with 2 Xp extremities and no Xq extremity. In the rearranged X chromosome the Xq extremity was substituted by Xp and pericentrometric Xq region. After FISH analysis the subpopulation previously indicated as 46,X,rea(X) was then redefined as 46,X,idic(X)(q24) ().\nThe final definition of the karyotype as released to the is mos 46,X,idic(X)(q24)?[59]/45,X [41], compatible with a “Turner like” condition that can account for the clinical and endocrinological condition of the patient.\nAfter a written informed consent was obtained from first degree relatives of our patient (parents and sister), a GTG karyotype analysis extended to family members demonstrated that the phenotype observed in our patient was the result of a de novo alteration. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 57-year-old gentleman was referred with high grade intermittent fever with chills since 3 months. He was a longstanding type 2 diabetic, on oral hypoglycemic agents with a fairly good sugar control. He did not have any constitutional symptoms like weight loss or anorexia. He was normotensive and had no specific urinary symptoms. Other than the fever for which he consumed paracetamol, he was fairly asymptomatic. There were no clinical clues to the etiology for the fever on systemic examination.\nThe complete blood count of the patient showed an Hemoglobin 11 g/dL, total leukocyte count 10,100 (polymorphs 85, lymphocytes 13% and eosinophils 2%) and a normal platelet count of 2.73 lacs. Liver function tests were essentially normal with a bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase/ALT of 36 and 31 IU/L, serum albumin 3.84 g/dL, and serum globulin 2.46 g/dL. Renal function tests showed BUN 55 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, and normal serum electrolytes. The urine analysis was essentially bland with no albumin, 1-2 pus cells, and no red cells.\nTest results during these 3 months revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 90 mm at the end of 1 h and two high C-reactive protein levels of 35.8, 24, and 18.5 mg/L (Normal up to 6 mg/L). Complete blood count, urine examination, chest radiology, and 2D Echo performed to investigate the cause of the fever were all normal. Blood and urine cultures were also negative. Serum Ferritin and complement levels were normal. anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative. angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Tumor marker profile was negative. Enzyme immunoassays for tuberculosis and brucellosis were negative. He was treated empirically with antibiotics during this period with no permanent relief.\nThe abdominal ultrasound was also essentially normal. A whole body computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymph nodes measuring 1.5-4 cm in the mediastinum and retrocarinal region reported to be of inflammatory/infective etiology. Fine needle aspiration of the lymph node was reported as non-specific lymphadenitis. The contrast CT abdomen revealed heterogeneous enhancement of both kidneys with hypodensities at the lower pole [].\nGiven the clinical presentation and the clinical possibilities of vasculitis and lymphoma, and the kidney findings on CT, a renal biopsy was performed. The conspicuous feature was presence of expansile interstitial fibrosis with a plasma cell rich interstitial infiltrate that were accompanied by a few lymphocytes and occasional eosinophil []. Some areas of the biopsy showed storiform fibrosis. There were neither neutrophils nor granulomas. The fibro inflammatory process was seen to extend into the peri-nephric tissue and had resulted in significant tubular loss. The remaining tubules showed thickening of their basement membranes. The glomeruli revealed diffuse capillary wall thickening but there were no changes of diffuse or nodular diabetic glomerulopathy. The arteries revealed mild medial thickening. The pathologic features raised the suspicion for IgG4 related tubulointerstitial nephritis. Immunofluorescence was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4. IgG4 immunohistochemistry was performed which showed numerous IgG4 expressing plasma cells amounting to at least 15 per high power field (HPF) []. The pathologic diagnosis was IgG4 related tubulointerstitial nephritis. Corresponding serum IgG4 level was 5.9 g/L (N-0.01-1.3 g/L). The diagnosis of IgG4 mediated nephropathy was made on the basis of the clinical history, CT scan findings, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and serology. He was initiated on a dose of 40 mg prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) and his fever defervesced within 24 h. The steroids were continued and tapered over the next 5 months. His serum creatinine touched a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL at the end of 2 months therapy with steroids. Although an attempt was being made to taper down the steroids further, his fever recurred at a steroid dose of 5 mg/day. He was therefore initiated on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) with a dose of 1 g b.i.d to which his fever responded again. Steroids were stopped by the end of the 5th month and MMF was continued. The serum IgG4 levels progressively declined from a peak of 5.9 g/L to 2.04 followed by 1.55 g/L by the end of the 4th month. The patient continued to be on a dose of 2 g of MMF per day. The CT scan repeated after 6 months showed a significant regression in the mediastinal and retrocarinal lymphadenopathy and resolution of the original hypodense foci in the kidneys. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Further investigation found multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (low thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, low cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone at 8 am, and low IGF-1 levels). Hypopituitarism was diagnosed based on laboratory findings. Magnetic resonance imaging showed aplasia of the pituitary gland, interrupted pituitary stalk, and ectopic posterior bright spot (Figure ). A diagnosis of pituitary stalk interruption syndrome was made. Levothyroxine 50 μg per day and hydrocortisone 20 mg per day were started. His poor compliance made him take these medicines occasionally. To achieve ideal height, his recombinant human GH (rhGH) treatment was started at the age of 14 years, and lasted for 5 years. At the age of 23 years, he was diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Physical examination revealed acanthosis nigricans, barrel chest with clear bilateral respiratory sounds, cyanotic lips, and clubbed fingers (Figure ). Hepatomegaly was palpable 4 cm beneath the xiphoid and 8 cm beneath the right costal margin. Splenomegaly was also palpable. Gynecomastia (Tanner stage IV) and prepubertal testicular size of 3 mL could be observed.\nLaboratory results indicated multiple pituitary hormones deficiency. Pulmonary function test showed decreased infiltration of oxygen from pulmonary alveoli into the blood. Common causes for cirrhosis, especially hepatitis B virus infection, were ruled out by serological evaluation (Table ). Activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio were within normal range, but prothrombin time was 14.9 s (normal range: 11-13 s).\nGastric varices were observed by gastroscopy (Figure ). Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhosis and hypersplenotrophy without ascites (Figure and ). There was no evidence of an intracardiac shunt on echocardiography, and the ejection fraction was 52%. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography revealed opacification of the left chambers of the heart by micro-bubbles five heartbeats after the appearance of microbubbles in the right atrium, suggesting intrapulmonary shunting (Figure ). 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin perfusion lung scan demonstrated intrapulmonary arterio-venous right-to-left shunting with a shunt rate of 64.4% (Figure , top). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

The abdominal computed tomography showed no evidence of stone in both kidneys ().\nDue to uremic symptoms, emergency hemodialysis was started and the kidney biopsy was performed to identify the cause of ESRD. The kidney biopsy showed foci of tubular damage with deposition of translucent crystals of different shapes which are predominantly intraluminal, and confirmed these crystals as calcium oxalate crystals using polarized light (). Final report of pathology was chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystal deposits and a change of ESRD.\nHe was an office worker. He received regular national health examination including renal function and urinalysis, and both results were normal until two years before admission. His height and body weight were 167 cm and 70 kg. Body mass index was 25 kg/m2. Review of medical history revealed no history of kidney stone, diabetes, hypertension and operation. He had no medical family history. From the drug history, he had taken Chaga mushroom powder for 5 years due to atopic dermatitis. Initially, he had taken 3 g daily for 4 years following company's recommendation and 9 g of powder for another year because his symptom did not improve.\nBased on pathologic finding (oxalate nephropathy) and drug history (long-term exposure to Chaga mushroom), we suspected the association between Chaga mushroom and oxalate nephropathy in our case. Thus, we requested oxalate content of remained Chaga mushroom to researcher/clinical pharmacology division of Catholic Medical center clinical research coordinating center of Korea. Measurement of oxalate was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analysis revealed extremely high content of oxalate in Chaga mushroom powder (0.14 g of oxalate per 1 g of Chaga mushroom powder).\nWe finally diagnosed this case as Chaga mushroom-induced oxalate nephropathy with kidney biopsy findings, drug history and high content of oxalate. Clinical course of our case was unfavorable. Renal function has not recovered and he is on maintenance hemodialysis for 18 months.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Korea (IRB No. 2019-3713-0001) and an informed consent was received from the patient and a caregiver.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 49 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 20.5 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 167.0 cm, which is 167.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.67 m. The patient's weight is 70.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 70.0 kg / (1.67 m * 1.67 m) = 25.1 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 25.1, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 167.0 cm, which is 167.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 65.748 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (65.748 (in inches) - 60) = 63.22 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 63.22 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 63.22 kg + 0.4 * (70.0 kg  - 63.22 kg) = 65.932 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 65.932 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 49) * 65.932 * 1) / (20.5 * 72) = 4.065 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 4.065 mL/min.",

    "Lower Limit": "-2.62",
    "Upper Limit": "-2.38",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 113.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (113.0 mEq/L + 20.0 mEq/L) = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 2.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 4.0 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 2.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.0 (in g/dL)) = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 2.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 2.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 2.0 - 12 = -10.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -10.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -10.0 mEq/L / 4.0 mEq/L = -2.5. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is -2.5.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 52-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, and past cerebrovascular accident presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status. The patient had been well, per family, including an uncomplicated HD session earlier that day, until the evening of presentation when family noted that he had increasing confusion and agitation, progressive for three to four hours, prompting them to call 911. On arrival to the patient’s home, paramedics noted that he was severely agitated, moaning loudly, and “jerking about,” particularly the bilateral upper extremities. To facilitate safe transfer to the hospital and due to paramedic concern for possible seizure-like activity, they administered midazolam five milligrams (mg) intramuscularly.\nUpon presentation to the ED, the patient was noted to be febrile (38.94°C), tachycardic (115 beats per minute), and hypertensive (blood pressure 224/104 millimeters mercury (mmHg). He was moaning loudly with no coherent speech and unable to follow specific commands; however, he was responding to painful stimuli and appeared to respond to his name. Additionally, the patient was moving all extremities spontaneously and had no appreciable cranial nerve defects. The remainder of his physical exam revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally, no abdominal distension or perceived tenderness, and warm, dry, intact skin with no signs of breakdown or ulcers. Further evaluation and treatment were initiated, and the patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage. A clevidipine infusion at one mg per hour was also started in the ED.\nOne hour after arrival and treatment initiation, the patient’s blood pressure was 143/90 mm Hg, and the infusion was discontinued. Additionally, chest radiograph did not show any acute abnormality, and computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed chronic changes in the left putamen in the setting of known remote cerebrovascular accident. Laboratory evaluation was significant for an elevated blood urea nitrogen of 60 mg per deciliter (mg/dL) (reference range: 7–20 mg/dL) and creatinine of 8.3 mg/dL (0.8–1.2 mg/dL) in the setting of known ESRD. Otherwise, urinalysis did not show evidence of infection, urinary drug screen was negative, white blood cell count was 7.05 × 103/microliter (mL) (4.5–11 × 103/mL), and salicylate and acetaminophen levels were within normal limits. However, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab returned positive for SARS-CoV-2. A lumbar puncture was also performed, which evidenced clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white blood cell count of zero per cubic millimeter (mm3) (0–5/mm3), protein of 46 mg/dL (10–60 mg/dL), and mildly elevated glucose of 121 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.\nDuring ICU admission, the patient remained encephalopathic despite administration of antipyretics in the ED. His blood pressure remained stable with systolic less than 180 mm Hg with lisinopril 20 mg and amlodipine 10 mg daily. Antibiotic coverage was discontinued after approximately 48 hours as no signs of infection were present clinically or by laboratory evidence, and CSF culture returned negative (including varicella, herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed on the morning of ICU day two, which did not show any acute pathologic changes. Continuous electroencephalogram for 24 hours was begun approximately six hours after initial presentation and showed evidence of mild, diffuse cerebral dysfunction. On ICU day three, the patient’s mentation began to improve, and he was noted to be increasingly alert, able to follow basic commands and speak simple phrases. On hospital day four, the patient was downgraded to a floor bed setting where he remained for an additional five days until his mentation was considered “back to baseline” with subsequent hospital discharge.\nRepeat SARS-CoV-2 testing during outpatient follow-up 20 days after his initial ED presentation was negative.

His previous history was noteworthy for mild paraparesis of the lower limbs since birth being attributed to birth trauma, poliomyelitis, or cerebral palsy, bilateral hip dysplasia since birth, chronic alcoholism, arterial hypertension, inguinal hernia, reflux esophagitis, bougienage of the esophagus at age 66 years because of a cardia stenosis, right-sided hip total endoprosthesis, and deep venous thrombosis of the right lower limb, complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolism at age 66 years.\nShortly after TBI, the patient developed a series of generalized tonic clonic seizures, complicated by respiratory insufficiency requiring intubation and artificial ventilation (hospital day (hd) 1). As an antiepileptic treatment, levetiracetam (2000 mg/d) and midazolam (7 mg/h) were given. Additionally, he received norepinephrine, clonidine, ketamine, propofol, and sufentanil. Because of suspected increased intracranial pressure (ICP), an ICP probe was implanted from the left frontal side. There was lactic acidosis of 14 mmol/L, which regressed within 24 hours to normal values. Since the serum alcohol level was elevated to 1.92 g/L on admission, intravenous vitamin-B1 (300 mg/d) and oxazepam were given. On hd3, the patient was transferred to another intensive care unit. Despite rapid reduction of the sedating medication, the patient did not awake. There was megaloblastic anemia, when vitamin-B12 and folic acid were added. Hypothyroidism with a TSH level of 6.6U/mL (n, 0.2-3.7U/mL) was appropriately substituted. There was a mild, transient elevation of transaminases and the gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase during hospitalization.\nBecause of suspected recurrence of seizures on hd5, PHT (1000 mg/d) was administered intravenously. Shortly after starting PHT, spontaneous, overshooting movements of the head, upper limbs, and lower limbs became apparent. Initially, these hyperkinesias were misinterpreted as exacerbation of seizures due to ineffectivity of LEV and PHT, why valproic acid (VPA) was added. Repeated EEG recordings, however, did not show epileptiform discharges. Hyperkinesias occurred daily, either induced by care treatments or spontaneously. They were described as choreoathetotic and occurred in waves every 30-60 minutes and lasted for about 1 minute. Treatment with tiapride or quetiapine was ineffective. On hd6, the ICP probe was removed since ICP values were recurrently within normal limits. Clinical neurologic exam on hd13 revealed spoor. Strong pain stimuli induced stereotypic flexion contractions of the lower arms and athetoid rolling motions of the head. There was skewed deviation of the bulbs and the Babinski sign was positive bilaterally. VPA was withdrawn without effect on the hyperkinesias.\nOn neurologic exam at hd15 under remifentanil, clonidine, tiapride, and artificial ventilation, the patient was awake, but did not follow any instructions. There was right-sided ptosis. Upon passive mobilization, he reacted with repeated stereotypic, choreatic head movements to the right and athetoid flexions of the upper limbs. These hyperkinesias also occurred spontaneously. There was mild rigor bilaterally. Patella tendon reflexes were exaggerated. Since PHT was suspected to be responsible for choreoathetosis, it was immediately discontinued. On hd16, the PHT serum level was still elevated to 118 µmol/L (n, 39.8-79.2 µmol/L). However, within 48 h after discontinuation of PHT, choreoathetosis completely resolved. Clinical neurologic exam on hd17 confirmed complete resolution of hyperkinesias. On hd19, the patient was tracheostomized. During the further course, the patient awaked and followed simple instructions. Hyperkinesias did not recur. One week after discontinuation of PHT, the serum level of PHT was zero. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

She had presented 8 months earlier but defaulted before she could be scheduled for surgery.\nBreathlessness was worse on lying down, and she occasionally had acute exacerbations in breathlessness. She was not previously known to be asthmatic, and such exacerbations were poorly responsive to nebulization with salbutamol. Breathlessness became distressing a week before the presentation. There was an associated history of dysphonia but no history suggestive of thyrotoxicosis. The patient is a known hypertensive of 25 years' duration regular on medications. She had no history of surgery or exposure to anesthesia.\nOn examination, we found an elderly woman in semi-recumbent position, dyspneic at rest, and on oxygen (O2) supplementation by nasal prongs at 4 L/min. The patient was not pale and not cyanosed. A firm lower anterior neck mass measuring 6 cm by 4 cm was noted. It was possible to get above but not below the mass. Her respiratory rate was 34 cycles/min, with trachea deviated to the left. There was adequate mouth opening, Mallampati score was 2, and thyromental distance was 8 cm. There was globally reduced air entry with generalized inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi. Oxygen saturation was 96% (84% before commencement of O2). Her heart rate was 106 beats/min and blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg.\nBlood counts were normal, but electrolyte check revealed a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L (normal 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, corrected to 4.0 mmol/L preoperatively) and HCO3− of 30 mmol/L (22–26 mmol/L). Arterial blood gas was not available. Thyroid function test showed T4 of 16.7 pmol/L (12–22 pmol/L), T3 of 3.0 pmol/L (3.1–6.8 pmol/L), and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) of 1.43 mU/L (0.27–4.2 mU/L). Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography were essentially normal. Spirometry showed a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 0.93 L, forced vital capacity (FVC) of 4.04 L, and FEV1/FVC of 23%, an indication of severe airway obstruction.\nChest radiograph showed a huge mediastinal mass with a leftward deviation of the trachea and downward displacement of the heart []. There were bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities with prominent hilar markings. Computed tomography of the neck and chest revealed a huge soft-tissue mass extending from the root of the neck into the posterior mediastinal region at the level of the tracheal bifurcation. The mass is seen displacing the trachea to the left and compressing on it [].\nThe patient was counseled for AFOI and possible tracheostomy as a backup plan should the initial attempts at securing her airway fail. Consent was obtained accordingly, and she was fasted for 8 h. An appropriately sized double-lumen tube was not available, so nonkinkable endotracheal tubes (ETTs) of different sizes were gotten instead.\nThe patient was taken to the theater for surgery 3 days after the presentation. Two large bore cannulae were inserted, and intravenous glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, dexamethasone 8 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg were given as premedication. Routine monitors (ECG, Non-invasive blood presssure (NIBP), pulse oximeter, and temperature probe) were attached and baseline values obtained. Oxygen supplementation was continued with the patient in sitting position with SpO2 ranging between 94% and 97%. An intraarterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring was also inserted under local anesthesia.\nFollowing spraying of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx with 2% xylocaine, awake fiber-optic nasotracheal intubation was commenced with a size 6.5 mm I.D nonkinkable ETT. Intubation was successful; however, the ETT stopped just above the level of obstruction proximal to the carina. Air entry remained very poor bilaterally with measured tidal volumes ranging between 100 and 150 ml. Oxygen saturation remained stable at about 95% on FiO2 of 1 until the patient was sedated using sevoflurane at 2%; saturation promptly dropped to <90% necessitating the discontinuation of inhalational agent.\nAfter discussions between the anesthetist; ear nose, and throat (ENT); and cardiothoracic team leaders, it was agreed to do a tracheostomy in hope that inserting an ETT through the tracheal opening will allow for placement distal to the obstruction. A tracheostomy was done by the ENT surgeon under local anesthetic (1% lidocaine + adrenaline 1:200,000) infiltration. Subsequently, the in situ nasotracheal tube was withdrawn, and a new ETT inserted through the tracheal stoma. However, all attempts to go beyond the obstruction in the distal trachea proved abortive despite using different sizes of ETT (7.0, 6.5, and 6.0 mm, respectively). Air entry remained very poor, without improvement in oxygen saturation.\nAs a last resort, it was decided to utilize a rigid bronchoscope. Anesthesia was deepened using sevoflurane 5% and IV fentanyl 50 μg. A size 8-mm rigid bronchoscope was carefully inserted under direct vision by the cardiothoracic surgeon. It went through the narrowed portion of the trachea and was advanced further until placed just above the carina. The breathing circuit was then connected to the side port of the bronchoscope and the patient ventilated through the bronchoscope []. There was noticeable bilateral chest expansion with improved air entry on auscultation. Measured tidal volume was in the range of 300–350 ml, and oxygen saturation promptly improved to 100% on FiO2 of 1. A throat pack was put in place to minimize air leakage, and the patient's teeth protected with gauze around the bronchoscope.\nWith ventilation now adequate, an initial dose of 50 mg suxamethonium was administered to assess the effect of muscle relaxation on the patient's respiratory dynamics. Satisfied that respiration remained optimal despite muscle relaxation, a long-acting muscle relaxant, pancuronium 5 mg, was then given. Adequate analgesia was ensured with intravenous morphine 5 mg, and maintenance of anesthesia was with isoflurane as tolerated.\nSurgery commenced with the ENT team dissecting the anterior neck mass. The whole mass could not be removed from a cervical approach, so the cardiothoracic team performed a sternotomy to mobilize the mediastinal part of the goiter. The resected thyroid mass, the larger part of which was retrosternal, weighed 300 g []. The tracheostomy stoma was closed primarily. Oxygen saturation remained satisfactory (98%–100%) throughout the course of surgery.\nAt the end of the surgery, the throat pack was removed. While the patient was still under anesthesia and muscle paralysis, the rigid bronchoscope was gradually withdrawn ensuring that ventilation remained feasible at every point in time. Satisfied that there was no airway collapse with the withdrawal of the bronchoscope beyond the previously obstructed portions, the bronchoscope was removed and the patient was intubated with a size 7.0-mm ETT. Saturation remained satisfactory with good air entry bilaterally. Isoflurane was discontinued, and neuromuscular blockade reversed with the administration of neostigmine 2.5 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg.\nFollowing adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade and awakening from anesthesia, the patient was transferred on O2 supplementation to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative observation. She was said to have self-extubated about 4 h after the surgery and was placed on O2 by nonrebreathing facemask. Saturation remained stable ranging between 98% and 100%. By the next day, the facemask was replaced with nasal prongs which was well tolerated. However, further attempts to completely wean off O2 failed as the patient persistently desaturated off O2. She was commenced on physiotherapy and incentive spirometry.\nPostoperative chest radiograph showed a centralized trachea, widened mediastinum, and homogenous opacity in the lower lobe of the right lung []. Four days after the surgery, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the ward on O2 by nasal prongs. She was completely weaned off O2 by 8 days postoperative and discharged home on the 12th day after the surgery. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female. The patient's height is 171.0 cm, which is 171.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 67.323 in.  For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (67.323 (in inches) - 60) = 62.343 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 62.343 kg.The patient's weight is 102.0 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)).

Her blood pressure was 132/74 mmHg, heart rate 110/min and the respiratory rate 26/min. She was alert, her pupillary response slightly delayed, she had mild epigastric tenderness and the bowel sounds were diminished. Her blood values were as following: pH 7.51, pO2 121 mmHg (16.1 kPa), pCO2 18 mmHg (2.38 kPa), HCO3\n− 14 mmol/L, lactate 0.8 mmol/L, sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 3.2 mmol/L, chloride 123 mmol/L, ionized calcium 0.98 mmol/L, creatinine 72 μmol/L (0.81 mg/dL).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 142.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 142.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 142.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 123.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 123.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 123.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 123.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 123.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 123.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 14.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 14.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 14.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 14.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 14.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 14.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 142.0 mEq/L - (123.0 mEq/L + 14.0 mEq/L) = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 5.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 5.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 5.0 - 12 = -7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -7.0 mEq/L.",

She was undergoing regular follow-up after concomitant chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer 3 months ago. Also she was taking an amlodipine as an antihypertension drug. The patient usually consumed bay salt with her wrong belief that eating salt would be helpful to cure cancer. Two days before the hospital visit, her family member got to know that the patient had been taking 4 teaspoons of bay salt a day. In addition, the patient's oral intake had been markedly decreased, and had intermittent vomiting several days before the visit.\nOn arrival on our hospital, the patient showed dehydrated features such as dry tongue and reduced skin turgor. Blood pressure was 210/100mmHg and heart rate was 74 beats/min in the supine position. Initial laboratory tests showed the following values: serum sodium 203mEq/L [135–145], potassium 2.9mEq/L [3.5–5.0], chloride 167 mEq/L [96–108], bicarbonate 26.7mEq/L [21–28], inorganic phosphorus 1.1mg/dL [2.5–5.5], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 42.5 mg/dL [8–23], creatinine 2.21mg/dL [0.5–1.3], serum osmolality 415mOsm/kg [280–295], urine osmolality 369 mOsm/kg [300–900], urine sodium 158mEq/L [40–220]. Owing to the patient's inappropriately high BP and peripheral cyanosis, we checked transthoracic 2D-echocardiography. Echocardiography revealed markedly decreased the left ventricular (LV) chamber size and resultant concentric remodeling, which are caused by depletion of circulating volume. Kidney ultrasonography showed enlarged kidney (both kidney size about 12 cm) with increased corticomedullary differentiation, which was compatible findings with acute kidney injury. Brain CT showed no significant abnormal findings such as cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and infection.\nShe was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. For the proper hydration, we calculated free water deficit: estimated free water deficit [free water deficit = total body water × ((serum sodium/140) − 1)] was calculated as 12 liters. Hydration was initiated with hypotonic fluid (5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride). During initial aggressive hydration serum sodium level was even more elevated to 238 mEq/L 2 hours later, therefore we increased the replacement rate of water deficit. After that, however, serum sodium was unintendedly corrected at rates above 1mEq/L per hour (203mEq/L to 177mEq/L for 24 hours) and after 72 hours, the serum sodium concentration was nearly corrected to the normal level (less than 155mEq/L) (). Serum creatinine level also decreased to normal (0.8mg/dL) at the fourth day of hospitalization. Despite the high correction rate of hypernatremia, but the patient was completely recovered without any significant neurologic complications, and was discharged to home. In an outpatient clinic conducted after discharge, the patient's serum sodium level was well maintained around 140mEq/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 35-year-old female (weight, 65 kg; height, 159 cm) was scheduled to undergo a planned repeat CS. She had undergone a CS under spinal anesthesia 2 years previously. Her medical history revealed no seizures or other neurological disorder during her current or previous pregnancies. Preoperative evaluation revealed no remarkable risk factors such as hypertension or glucose intolerance. Thus, the patient was considered to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I during the preoperative consultation, and a combined spinalepidural anesthesia technique was planned. The patient was not premedicated. Monitoring involved electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Body temperature was monitored by a thermistor equipped at the top of a urinary catheter.\nWith the patient fully awake, the epidural catheter was placed at the T12/L1 space, and a spinal tap was performed at the L2/L3 space with a 25-G Quincke needle in the left lateral decubitus position after skin sterilization with 0.5 w/v% chlorhexidine gluconate/ethanol. After backflow of clear cerebrospinal fluid, 12.5 mg of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine without preservatives (AstraZeneca, Osaka, Japan) with 15 µg of fentanyl (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) were injected into the subarachnoid space. The patient was then placed in the supine position. Discernible sensory block to cold sensation was promptly observed. Finally, before the start of the surgical incision, a sensory block to cold to the T3 level with accompanying motor block was obtained. Vasopressors, including 8.0 mg of ephedrine and 0.6 mg of phenylephrine, were administrated to maintain systolic blood pressure at >100 mmHg during the operation. In total, 900 ml of a crystalloid and 500 ml of a colloid were administrated intravenously.\nThe surgical procedure proceeded uneventfully, and a live male infant and placenta were delivered 9 and 11 min after skin incision, respectively. All other surgical findings were unremarkable, and routine antibiotics and uterotonic oxytocin were administered. No drugs were administered into the epidural space. Because no hypnotics were used for sedation, the patient was awake during the operation.\nThe operation was completed 1 h 10 min after the spinal tap. At the time of completion, involuntary movements began ( and ). The movement was observed in both upper extremities, but the movement of the left side was more pronounced (). No remarkable vital sign changes were observed before or during the movement. The patient's systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were 105 mmHg, 74 mmHg, and 87 beats/min before the beginning of the movement and 110 mmHg, 69 mmHg, and 93 beats/min immediately after the beginning of the movement, respectively. The sensory block to cold subsided to the T8 level, and sensory and motor functions in her upper extremities were intact. The patient was fully conscious, calm, and responsive. She complained that she could not stop the movement. She did not complain that she felt cold. The body temperature at her bladder was 36.8℃, and no coldness of the upper extremities was observed. Because she was alert and in a calm mental state, she was untreated until examination by a neurologist. After the examination, 2 mg of midazolam were administered after 33 min of involuntary movement. Three minutes after administration, the involuntary movement stopped ().\nThe patient was subsequently transferred to the ward, and the involuntary movement did not recur. Five hours after the surgery, the spinal block had completely subsided. No abnormal sensation or spontaneous pain of the upper or lower extremities was observed.

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old man with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (AF) presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of left leg pain due to superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrombosis. Soon after arrival, he was scheduled to undergo emergency thrombectomy. He had been receiving metformin (850 mg/day) for DM, olmesartan (40 mg/day) for HTN, and warfarin (3 mg/day) and digoxin (0.25 mg/day) for AF. In the preoperative evaluation, chest radiography showed cardiomegaly, while electrocardiogram showed the presence of atrial fibrillation. Laboratory investigations showed no remarkable findings. Prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) were within the normal range (PT, 10.5 sec; INR, 0.92), even though the patient was on warfarin therapy. A central venous catheter (CVC, 7-Fr double lumen catheter) was inserted via the left subclavian vein using the landmark technique under general anesthesia. In the first attempt, the needle was passaged twice without aspiration of blood. In the second attempt, after positioning the needle tip, blood was successfully aspirated through the needle in the third passage to confirm its location, followed by successful insertion of the CVC.\nSubsequently, 5,000 U of heparin was administered 5 minutes before incision of the femoral artery for thrombectomy. The thrombectomy was performed uneventfully with an operative time of 90 minutes. The arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) during surgery showed the following: pH, 7.337; PaCO2, 43.4 mmHg; PaO2, 112 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 98%. Additionally, the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 15.6 g/dl. The estimated blood loss and urine output were approximately 100 ml and 300 ml, respectively. A total of 1,250 ml of Hartmann's solution was administered during surgery.\nThe patient was then transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. Postoperatively, continuous infusion of heparin (1,000 U/hr) via CVC was maintained. The infusion rate was adjusted under the activated partial thromboplastin time of 80-120 sec. A portable chest radiograph showed proper position of the CVC in the superior vena cava and no interval changes (). At 6 hr postoperation, a small swelling and oozing were observed at the insertion site of the CVC. Consequently, CVC was removed and compressed for 30 minutes. At 15 hr postoperation, when the patient's hemodynamic values were stable and the dorsalis pedis artery was palpable, he was transferred to the general ward. On the first postoperative day (POD), the patient was started on warfarin (4 mg/day). A chest radiograph at this point showed no remarkable findings except a slightly increased opacity in the left anterior chest wall (). In addition, there were no remarkable findings from the laboratory examinations. However, 10 mg of furosemide was administered when the urine output decreased, even though the fluid intake was adequate.\nOn POD 2, the patient experienced syncope on his way to bathroom, possibly due to orthostatic hypotension. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 80/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 142 bpm; and SpO2, 85%. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the ICU and a diagnostic workup was performed. The ABGA revealed severe metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.93; PaCO2, 28 mmHg; PaO2, 164 mmHg; HCO3, 5.9 mM; oxygen saturation, 98%), and the patient received 15 L/min oxygen via a reservoir mask. His Hb level decreased from 14.3 g/dl to 9.6 g/dl. After transferring him to the ICU, his BP was 61/44 mmHg. Volume resuscitation was initiated with normal saline and packed red blood cells (RBCs). However, inotropes were not administered to the patient, because his BP increased to 90/50 mmHg after volume resuscitation. His hemodynamic values returned to normal with fluid therapy (4,300 ml of normal saline) and transfusion (3 units of packed RBC). In addition, sodium bicarbonate was administered to cure the severe acidosis. A computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge hematoma between the pectoralis major and minor muscles on the left chest wall (). However, an angiogram showed no detectable extravasations from the branches of the left subclavian artery. Laboratory tests revealed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome including respiratory failure, ischemic hepatitis, and acute kidney injury due to hemorrhagic shock. The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine (Cr) were remarkably elevated: AST, 2,800 IU/L; ALT, 2,100 IU/L; LDH, 6,000 IU/L; Cr, 3.40 mg/dl. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started on POD 2, and tracheal intubation was performed on POD 3 when an ineffective breathing pattern was observed and the SpO2 decreased to 90%. Mechanical ventilation was applied without any intervention to the hematoma, such as insertion of the wound, use of a suction tube, or surgical removal.

She complained of percussion tenderness to the lower thoracic vertebra and the upper sacral bone. Her manual muscle testing score for the left lower limb was 4; on the other hand, nothing else abnormal, including skin or neurologic findings, was detected upon physical examination.\nA routine laboratory examination of the patient revealed increased values of white blood cells, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and decreased values of blood urea nitrogen and creatine kinase. On the other hand, other values were normal, including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, urine tests, and cerebrospinal fluid examination (). She also tested negative for rheumatoid factor, autoantibodies such as anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serologic test for hepatitis B and C, syphilis, HIV, thyroid hormone, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, flu test, and 2/2 sets of blood culture. Head and chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans and transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal results. On the other hand, a complete spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 0.5- mm-thick layer of spinal epidural fluid in the posterior epidural space in the whole thoracic and anterior epidural space from the L5 to S2 vertebral body level region, which compressed the epidural space (, and , respectively). These findings were revealed as low intensity in a T1-weighted image, and high intensity in a T2-weighted image. Other findings, such as discitis, were not confirmed.\nAt this point, we suspected a diagnosis of disseminated SEA, but the origin was still unknown. However, an orthopedic surgeon recommended against performing CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration of the abscess, based on the locations of the lesions. The patient was hospitalized, and we started 13.5 mg/day of piperacillin-tazobactam, following which she gradually became symptom-free. However, on the 14th hospital day, she strongly requested that she be discharged from the hospital, so we changed her antibiotics to 500 mg/day of levofloxacin tablets, and continued treatment. During her return visit, 16 days after her discharge, she was well. We confirmed normal values of inflammation biomarkers, including WBC, CRP, and ESR, and in addition we also confirmed abscess improvements in both the thoracic and sacral regions through an MRI scan (, and , respectively). Based on these findings, we ended her treatment that day without treatment complications. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female. The patient's height is 153.0 cm, which is 153.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 60.236 in.  For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (60.236 (in inches) - 60) = 46.043 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 46.043 kg.The patient's weight is 42.0 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)).

She reported waking up with lower extremity weakness and became progressively weak and unable to ambulate throughout the course of the morning. After sustaining a fall, she was able to crawl to the nearest phone to call a friend to transport her to the emergency department.\nThe patient's past medical history consisted of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and systolic heart failure. Home medications included simvastatin 40 mg daily, digoxin 0.125 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg twice daily, insulin 70/30 (40 units every AM, 25 units every PM), ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily, and potassium chloride 20 mEq twice daily. The patient reported taking two potassium chloride tablets twice daily for approximately the past week.\nVital signs on admission were as follows: temperature 36.5°C, blood pressure 139/77 mmHg, pulse 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 13 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed flaccid paralysis in both upper and lower extremities. Cranial nerves and sensation were intact with no focal motor deficits. Pertinent laboratory values on admission were as follows: sodium 127 mEq/L, potassium greater than 8 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 15 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 114 mg/dL, glucose 316 mg/dL, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, and digoxin 1.8 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed first-degree atrioventricular block (PR interval 246 ms) with peaked T waves. The patient was determined to be in acute renal failure with her baseline creatinine being 1.3 mg/dL four months prior to admission; history also revealed radiocontrast administration with no timing specified in relation to this admission for acute renal failure.\nUpon receiving laboratory results, therapy was immediately initiated with one gram of calcium gluconate, 10 units of regular insulin plus 25 grams of dextrose, and 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate intravenously. Repeat labs two hours after treatment revealed a serum potassium concentration of 8 mEq/L. Serum potassium was decreased to 6.5 mEq/L three hours after additional sodium bicarbonate and insulin plus a 30 gram dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Repeat serum creatinine at this time was 2.8 mg/dL. The patient was admitted for further workup and management of nonoliguric renal failure and hyperkalemia. Neuromuscular symptoms and ECG returned to baseline within 24 hours of presentation and serum potassium returned to 4.2 mEq/L at approximately 36 hours. Lisinopril, spironolactone, and potassium chloride therapies were discontinued and hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate were initiated prior to discharge. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "296.656",
    "Upper Limit": "327.883",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 127.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 127.0 mEq. To convert from 127.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 127.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 127.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 127.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 127.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 127.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 114.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 316.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 127.0 + (114.0 / 2.8) + (114.0 / 18) = 312.27 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 312.27 mmol/L.

A pertinent positive finding on the initial history taking was his having traveled to a country where tuberculosis is endemic. Physical examination revealed no acute distress and no stigmata of intravenous drug abuse. He was febrile (≤ 38.5°C), with a blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg, a heart rate of 76 bpm, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and a constant SpO2 at rest of 98%. The initial total leukocyte count was 8,200 cells/µL, with a predominant neutrophilic reaction. Blood culture was negative for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Urine toxicology and HIV tests were negative. Chest X-ray and HRCT showed micronodules (1-3 mm in size) bilaterally in centrilobular distribution (). An IFN-γ assay and sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli were carried out in order to rule out mycobacterial infection. Although the results were negative for tuberculosis, the high clinical suspicion of the disease prompted empirical initiation of the four-drug antituberculous therapy. Four weeks later, the patient returned to the emergency room with worsening of the shortness of breath. A repeat HRCT revealed similar centrilobular nodules with no radiological improvement (). At that time, bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy was performed for further evaluation of the pulmonary micronodules. Examination of the BAL fluid, with Ziehl-Neelsen staining, revealed no acid-fast bacilli. Histopathological analysis of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed multiple granulomas with birefringent material in the center (), confirming the diagnosis of PFBG. The patient strongly denied intravenous drug use. Unfortunately, he experienced a progressive course with a further decline in his lung function.

    "Lower Limit": "3",
    "Upper Limit": "3",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 76.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8200.0 count/µL. To convert 8200.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 8200.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 8200000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.

He underwent surgical procedures due to his disease including excision of haemangioblastomas of posterior cranial fossa and left nephrectomy. Also, he had a history of whole-body radiation therapy, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and surgical excision of haemangioblastoma T3 and patellectomy T2-T4.\nThe patient was referred to the rehabilitation department after his last surgical intervention for the spinal cord lesion. Upon admission the neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal tract syndrome, positive cerebellar signs, and urinary dysfunction (requiring a urethra indwelling catheter). He had no sitting balance. MMS examination was 30/30. Most muscles in his upper limbs were grade 4/5, whereas most muscles in his lower limbs were grade 3/5. According to ASIA/ISCoS International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) the patient was classified as AIS D[]. Assessment of muscle tonus revealed spasticity grade 2 according to Ashworth scale in the lower limbs and presence of pyramidal signs such as hyperreflexia (right>left), Babinski sign, and mild clonus at the right ankle. He had symptoms of generalized pain, mainly in the limbs. His pain was evaluated according to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as moderate (5/10). He also had symptoms of neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD), mostly constipation and a Foley catheter was placed due to patient’s incontinence. His BMI was 14.67 Kg/m2 (weight: 44 Kg, height: 1.75 m).\nBlood examination revealed anemia (Hct: 31,3%) and vitamin D deficiency (6 ng/mL). The abdominal ultrasound revealed the left nephrectomy, the hypertrophy of the right kidney, multiple renal cysts in the right kidney and a cystic lesion, a tumor having echomorphology of angiomyolipoma, nephrolithiasis with no dilation of the pelvicalyceal system and a tumor in the adrenal gland. Chest x ray was normal. To evaluate his bone density we performed a DXA. Z-score values, measured at both hips, were in osteopenia range (-1.7 left and -2 right, respectively). However, knee X-ray revealed osteoporotic bone image. Vitamin D was prescribed according to DXA and lab results, based on current national guidelines for men. The urodynamic study revealed neurologic bladder dysfunction, detrusor overactivity and detrusor- external sphincter dyssynergia. That led to the need of performing intermittent self-catheterization. Limitation was the co-existing cerebellar syndrome, resulting in lack of coordination of the upper limbs’ movements, as well as the absence of a carer.\nHis NBD was treated with bowel management program, suppositories and laxatives. For his pain we used opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesics with excellent results. Oral baclofen was used for the generalized spasticity with frequent assessment and dose adjustment. For depressive symptoms he received venlafaxine 150 mg and trazodone.\nHe attended an inpatient rehabilitation program which consisted of one 30-minute session of physical and one 30-minute session of occupational therapy 5 days/week. The physiotherapist conducted a prescribed physical therapy program which included gradually mobilization from supine in standing position using Tilt Table, bed side physiotherapy including respiratory exercises, active assisted range of motion exercises and stretching, and after re-education of sitting with graduated balance, and torso strengthening and respiratory exercises in sitting position, sitting on the bed with support, sitting on wheelchair, and later on mobilizing the patient early with knee ankle foot orthosis and standing – walking combined with balance and strengthening exercises in upright position. Occupational therapy department organized a plan to adapt to his functionality and good cognitive status to correct positions for transfer, improve capabilities on self-care deficits: dressing, toileting, bathing and mobility (ambulation with a wheelchair).\nThe patient was discharged home after 3 and half months of neurorehabilitation.

She was admitted to our clinic for acute psychotic exacerbation. Due to numerous treatments in our clinic over the last 10 years, our patient was well known and the diagnosis of schizophrenia had been secured based on several psychotic episodes and unremarkable somatic examination, including analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid, an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging of her brain.\nInitially, she presented with auditory hallucinations, disorganized speech, inappropriate affect with an occasionally euphoric mood, grossly disorganized behavior and excitability. Prior to this hospital admission, her antipsychotic treatment (retard preparation of quetiapine, 700 mg per day) was taken irregularly. Further, impaired glucose tolerance due to adiposity and metabolic syndrome (weight 102.8 kg, height 156 cm, body mass index 42.2 kg/m2) was treated with metformin (500 mg per day). We first continued quetiapine for seven days without amelioration of the clinical situation. In view of sufficient quetiapine serum levels (854 ng/mL) and remarkable obesity, a treatment trial with an increased dosage of quetiapine was not performed. While tapering off quetiapine, we administered amisulpride and titrated up to a daily dosage of 1200 mg within five days. No substantial improvement was achieved with this regimen within 21 days.\nPhenotypic testing in our patient with dextromethorphan (DM) revealed CYP2D6 UM status (DM < 5 ng/mL; dextrorphan (DO) 640 ng/mL; DM/DO ratio: < 0.008; 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) < 5 ng/mL; 3-hydroxymorphinan (HM) 24 ng/mL; MM/HM ratio: 0.21), which also explained recent ineffective treatment attempts with risperidone (up to 8 mg per day) and haloperidol-decanoate (up to 150 mg per injection). This phenotypic testing was performed by taking a blood sample (120 mL) exactly one hour after the oral application of 40 mL NeoTussan® cough syrup (111 mg dextromethorphan per 100 g suspension (Novartis Consumer Health GmbH; city: Munich; state: Bavaria; country: Germany). Her blood was analyzed for metabolites of DM and MM, which are substrates of CYP2D6. The DM to DO and MM to HM ratios are surrogate parameters for CYP2D6 activity.\nFollowing the reduction of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day, haloperidol (10 mg per day) was applied as an additional antipsychotic. Simultaneously, trazodone (100 mg per day) was added on in order to augment the haloperidol by CYP2D6 inhibition, but did not show significant clinical success in the next days. Gradual escalation of haloperidol and trazodone doses over a period of one month did not obtain amelioration of the psychotic phenomena. At that time, haloperidol plasma levels (current medication: amisulpride 800 mg per day; haloperidol 15 mg per day; trazodone 200 mg per day; and metformin 500 mg per day) were at 10 ng/mL. A subsequent increase of haloperidol up to 20 mg per day did neither improve the clinical situation nor serum plasma levels (9 ng/mL). Since her psychopathological findings did not change under treatment with amisulpride and still presented as on admission time, the antipsychotic effect of amisulpride was evaluated to be insufficient according to the treatment guideline for schizophrenia of the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neuroscience []. After discontinuation of trazodone and amisulpride, we administered melperone (100 mg per day), in order to inhibit CYP2D6, and elevated haloperidol up to 30 mg per day. After 14 days, her haloperidol plasma levels were at 19 ng/mL. This result was confirmed in a second test (haloperidol: 20 ng/mL). In line with this, her clinical performance improved slightly, and she demonstrated attenuation in her auditory hallucinations, redevelopment of day structure and a marked improvement regarding behavior and speech. Our patient was then discharged with this medication in a clearly improved clinical condition. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

His performance status (PS) was Grade 2 (Height, 168 cm; Weight, 58 kg; BMI, 20 kg/m2). He had a history of appendicitis that was operated upon. On physical examination, the tumor was located on the upper left side of the abdominal wall measuring around 5 cm with poor mobility and partial ulceration but without pain (Fig. ). At a nearby hospital, he had previously undergone physical examination and computed tomography (CT) for his symptoms. Advanced gastric cancer with invasion to the skin of the abdominal wall was suspected and, for more specific investigation and therapy, he was referred to our department. We obtained informed consent from all participants, and all procedures therapy were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nHis blood investigation revealed the following: hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 6,060 /μL, platelets 321,000 /μL, prothrombin time-international nomarized ratio (PT-INR) 1.05, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chlorine 105 mmol/L, creatinine 0.91 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 13 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 10 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 249 U/L, γ-guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (γ-GTP) 14 U/L, LD 156 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 0.41 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen-S (CEA-S) 1.6 ng/mL, alpha-fetoprotein 1.83 ng/mL and carbohydorate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) <2 U/mL. There was moderate anemia but there was no organ failure and or elevation of tumor marker.\nOn Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a Type 3 tumor that measured around 40 mm was observed occupying from the angle of the stomach to the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach (Fig. ).\nOn biopsy, the histological type was revealed as tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1) and immunostaining for HER2 was negative.\nThoracoabdominal enhanced CT revealed invasion of the tumor from the anterior wall of the stomach to the lateral region of the liver and infiltration from the abdominal wall to the skin. There was no evidence of metastasis or ascites (Fig. ).\nOn the basis of these findings, we diagnosed advanced gastric cancer (L-Less, Gre, type 3, 40 mm, tub1), cT4b (SI; liver, skin) N0M0 c Stage IIIA. Initially we anticipated chemotherapy considering that the patient's PS was Grade 2 and the defect of abdominal wall was too large for surgery. In addition, the patient did not want to undergo surgery. S-1+Cisplatin (SP) therapy was performed as first-line therapy every 3 weeks [].\nObvious shrinkage of the tumor invasion to the skin was observed, and we determined that PR was obtained at the end-point of 4th course of SP therapy. However, because of malaise (Grade 2), we had to set a 1-month interval. During the interval, the invasion to the skin gradually increased again; hence, another two courses of SP regimen were added with decreased dose. After six courses of SP therapy had been completed, PR was obtained again by the re-shrinkage of the skin tumor on physical examination and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT (Fig. , ). At this point, the patient was not amenable to surgery or chemotherapy; hence, we adopted a “wait-and-see” approach. During this period, the skin tumor underwent re-growth gradually for which RAM/PTX therapy (3-week administration at 1-week intervals) was introduced as the second line chemotherapy, 2 months after the previous one []. Over the course of therapy, anemia (Grade 3) and neutropenia (Grade 2) were observed and we were compelled to skip one administration each of PTX in course 2 and 3but RAM dosage was completely administrated through all five courses (Fig. ). Throughout the second line of therapy, the skin tumor kept decreasing visually and enhanced abdominal CT revealed the shrinkage of the primary tumor and the invasion to the lateral area of the liver and skin. Similar findings were observed on gastrointestinal endoscopy; and hence, we determined that PR was obtained again (Fig. ). Since his general condition was observed have improved, we planned to perform surgery with the aim of reaching a chemotherapy-free status.\nWe performed open total gastrectomy with D2 lymph nodes dissection (Roux-en-Y reconstruction) with combined partial resection of the skin, abdominal wall, and liver. There were no findings of the peritoneal dissemination, metastasis to the liver, or ascites (Fig. ). The components separation method was performed for abdominal wall closure with the defect of the skin by exposure of the anterior sheath of abdominal rectal muscles and resection of partial aponeurosis of the right external abdominal oblique muscle. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Her birth weight was 2690 g (50th centile for gestational age), her birth length was 47 cm (25th centile), her head circumference was 32.5 cm (25th centile) and her Apgar score was 9/9. After the birth there were no major concerns, although patent ductus arteriosus and haemodynamically significant atrial septal defect (ASD) had been diagnosed, and pronounced dysmorphic features had been observed. She had upward and slanted palpebral fissures with ptosis of both. This was more pronounced in the left upper palpable. Hypertelorism was also observed and the nose was small in size and saddle-shaped. She had a prominent frontal part of the skull, giving the false impression of macrocrania. Her ears were low-set, asymmetrical, triangular and slightly protuberant. Both lips were accentuated in shape and sometimes stretched in an asymmetrical manner (Figure ). A high-arched palate was also observed. There was evidence of general muscular hypotonia and her developmental milestones were delayed. She sat up without help at 12 months and started walking at 18 months. Her speech development was also late, and only developed after she was three years old. Her social and psychical development were surprisingly good. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed hyperintensive changes in the white matter and hypoplastic corpus callosum. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal and there were no convulsions.\nAt 12 months, she suffered from serious acute pyelonephritis, and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed thereafter. The ultrasound kidney volumes were normal with no major dilatation of the renal pyelon. The endoscopic treatment of the VUR was performed on two occasions. Lastly, after classical surgical treatment, the VUR was successfully treated. At that time, her neurodevelopment was equivalent to that of a 9-month-old infant.\nAssessments of the child are being carried out every six months. With the exception of one case of pneumonia and one case of acute laryngitis, no additional health problems had been reported. There were no recurrent urinary tract infections.\nThe girl is currently 5 years old. She weighs 15.5 kg (10th centile), has a height of 110 cm (50th centile) and a head circumference of 49 cm (10th centile). The dysmorphic features are still prominent. She has lower basic muscle tone, especially in the shoulder muscles and the pelvic girdle. Her muscle strength is fairly good and her reflexes are normal. There are no major problems with fine motorics and there are no abnormal movements or contractures. Her palms, especially hypothenar, are hypoplastic and her fingers are thin. Her foot arches are prominent. Hips incline to internal rotation with knees adduction and inward feet rotation, which has no major impact on her gait. Both renal function and blood pressure are normal. At present, she is preparing for the correction of a congenital heart defect.\nShe is managed with a team of experts and receives special logopaedic, psychological, and defectological assistance. The girl is motivated, cooperates and strives for success and progress. She is pleasant, friendly, good-natured and no emotional or behavioural problems have been observed. Despite her relatively normal development, a psychological examination (Goodenough Draw, Gessell Drawing Test, Brunet-Lesine scale, Vineland Social Maturity Scale, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - WISC) reveals some cognition deficits and borderline intellectual functioning, requiring specialised help and causing delays in her formal education. She follows and understands simple instructions, speaks in sentences, but her pronunciation is unclear. Her global intelligence quotient is 76 (WISC test). Her social maturity meets the requirements of a 5-year-old child (Vineland Social Maturity Scale).

On examination, he was normo-tensive and showed pitting pedal edema. There was a tender hepatomegaly extending three fingers below the costal margin in the mid-clavicular line. Shifting dullness was positive. Hematological investigations revealed Hb level of 9 g/dL and WBC of 7,500/mm3. The biochemical investigations showed a raised BUN of 65 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. Urine analysis revealed slight proteinuria. Liver functions tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, serum ALP of 247 IU/L, AST 40 IU/L and ALT 80 IU/L. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed an abscess in the right lobe of liver on its postero-superior surface measuring 1.4×1×1 cm with internal echoes and moderate ascites. Color doppler scan was done which showed patent hepatic veins with normal hepatofugal flow. Hepatic IVC was seen displaced and compressed by the large abscess cavity but the flow was normal. Infra-hepatic IVC was dilated to 1.7 cm. The Doppler findings were suggestive of IVC obstruction due to the liver abscess with proximal dilatation. A contrast enhanced CT scan confirmed the findings of thrombus in the IVC (). The patient tested positive for amoebic antibody by indirect haemagglutination test. The patient was started on intravenous metronidazole and broad spectrum antibiotics. The liver abscess was aspirated twice under ultrasonic guidance within a period of two days yielding 500 mL and 360 mL of pus. The pus was thick, creamy and brownish in color and did not grow any organisms on culture. The ascites and pedal edema disappeared rapidly after the treatment. Doppler scan repeated four days later showed a decrease in the infra-hepatic IVC dilatation.

In September 2016, the patient underwent laparoscopic irregular hepatectomy (V and VI liver segments) for primary HCC in our hospital. In July 2018, contrast-enhanced CT scan imaging revealed a neoplasm that showed enhancement in segment VII of the liver (Fig. ). The laboratory tumour marker AFP was 157.40 ng/ml. Recurrent HCC was diagnosed, and retroperitoneal laparoscopic hepatectomy was performed with the patient’s full knowledge and consent. Seventy-two hours before the operation, indocyanine green was injected through the peripheral vein at 0.25 mg/kg body weight (ICG-r15 = 13.4%).\nPatient position: Left recumbent position with a high waist cushion. Port site: A 2.0 cm incision was made under the costal margin of the right posterior axillary line, and a finger was inserted into the retroperitoneal cavity for blunt separation. A 1.0 cm incision was made on the iliac crest of the right midaxillary line, and a 0.5 cm incision was made under the front ribs on the right axillary line. Intraoperative procedure: Under fluorescent laparoscopic surveillance, an ultrasound scalpel was used to separate the retroperitoneal space to avoid incision of the peritoneum and to locate the right posterior lobe of the liver. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) was used for localization, and ICG fluorescence was used for navigation. Ultimately, the tumour was completely removed. The margin of incision was more than 1 cm away from the tumour (Figs. , ). During the operation, part of the retroperitoneum was cut into the peritoneal cavity to explore the liver and prevent overlooking other tumours. Operative time: 120 min. Intraoperative blood loss: 20 ml.\nLight microscopy demonstrated that the tumour cells grew in irregular cords or plates separated by dilated sinusoidal vessels (trabecular pattern) or in focal acinar or pseudoglandular structures. The tumour cells showed cytologic atypia and had abundant pale cytoplasm, large hyperchromatic nuclei, and identifiable nucleoli. Mitotic figures were frequently observed. Dilated bile canaliculi with condensed bile in the lumina were present.\nImmunohistochemical stains: GPC-3 (+), Arginase-1 (−), CEA (−), CK18 (+), CK19 (+), Hepatocyte (+), CK10 (+), CD34 (+), CK7 (−), Ki67 index(60%).\nPathological diagnosis: Moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe patient was discharged on the third day after the operation, and the AFP level decreased to 8.81 ng/ml on the 28th postoperative day.

Nothing unusual was found on examination of the chest and cardiovascular systems. Abdominal examination revealed mild hepatomegaly without splenomegaly. Examination of the nervous system showed normal mental status (patient was conscious and well oriented in time, place, and person). Sensations were diminished below the knees in both lower limbs. Power in all of the muscles was 4/5.

Serum calcium levels ranged from 8.4 to 9.2 mg/dL on different occasions. The venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor tests were negative, while C-reactive protein was raised. The Coombs test and the test for cold agglutinins were also negative. In addition, the serological markers for hepatitis B and hepatitis C were negative.

Ultrasonography revealed mild hepatomegaly (15.5 cm in size), while the spleen and both kidneys were within normal limits. The wall of the rectum and sigmoid colon demonstrated thickening. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed atrophy of the brain and multiple lytic lesions in the skull. The rectal wall was also edematous. There was mild hepatomegaly with the presence of minimal ascites. A clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma was considered due to the presence of lytic bony lesions, increased total protein values, decreased serum albumin, and low albumin to globulin ratio.\nBone marrow aspiration, bone marrow biopsy, and serum protein electrophoresis were simultaneously performed to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Bone marrow imprint smears were hypercellular with the presence of numerous bare nuclei, which were predominantly lymphoid cells with a few plasmacytoid cells (). The bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of a spectrum of lymphoid cells that were predominantly small lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, a few plasma cells, and mast cells (). The erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic series were markedly suppressed. Therefore, a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was considered. Immunohistochemical staining revealed 2 populations of cells; the predominant population was strongly positive for CD20 (lymphocytic cells) ( inset) while the other population was positive for CD138 (plasmacytic cells). CD5 and CD23 were negative, which ruled out chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.

    "problem": "<Context> A 61-year-old white woman presented in February 2013 with fatigue, decreased appetite and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 2 weeks. She denied nausea, vomiting, weight loss and jaundice. Two weeks prior to presentation, the patient was found to have elevated liver enzymes by routine blood workup (AST 151 IU/l, ALT 199 IU/l), for which atorvastatin and ezetimibe were both discontinued (although she had been taking both for a long time). She was known to have MS (as she had clumsiness and optic neuritis with white matter hyperintensities by brain MRI, at that time not on any treatment, but treated with interferon in 2000 with resulting drug-induced hepatitis which resolved after discontinuation of interferon), hypothyroidism on levothyroxine (secondary to radioactive iodine ablation for Graves disease), hyperlipidemia and asthma.\nOn physical examination, blood pressure was 113/77 mm Hg, heart rate 64 beats/min and temperature 36.3°C. She was not jaundiced and her heart and respiratory sounds were normal. Her abdomen was soft, not tender, not distended, without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and with normal bowel sounds. She was alert and oriented, the cranial nerves were grossly intact, muscle bulk, tone and power were normal, there was no sensory deficit, and coordination and gait were both unremarkable. Laboratory tests on admission revealed white blood cells 6.1 × 103/μl, hemoglobin 14 g/dl, platelets 433 × 103/μl, sodium 138 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l, chloride 103 mEq/l, bicarbonate 29 mmol/l, BUN 11 mg/dl, creatinine 0.7 mg/dl and glucose 94 mg/dl. Liver function test showed AST 1,740 IU/l, ALT 1,497 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 140 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dl (direct bilirubin 1.3) – later on it went up to 5.1 mg/dl, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGTP) 501 IU/l (normal 7–64 IU/l), total protein 8.3 g/dl and albumin 3.8 g/dl. Coagulation panel showed prothrombin time 13.6 s, international normalized ratio 1.44 and partial thromboplastin time 30.9 s. Urine drug screen was negative. The results of thyroid function testing were thyroid-stimulating hormone 10.3 mIU/ml and free thyroxine 0.8 ng/dl. She had normal alpha-fetoprotein and a negative ethanol level. Serum protein electrophoresis showed high gamma fraction of protein 2.1 g/dl. Viral hepatitis was ruled out by negative hepatitis panel including negative hepatitis C virus RNA PCR. Complete serological tests revealed positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies at 1:320 (normal titer <1:40), negative anti-mitochondrial antibodies, negative anti-nuclear antibodies, negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, negative anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies, negative proteinase-3 antibodies and negative liver kidney microsomal antibodies. Ultrasound of the liver was performed and showed no significant abnormality in the liver, gallbladder or pancreas. There was no sign of gallstone or pericholecystic fluid formation. Abdominal computed tomography with contrast showed only mild fatty changes of the liver.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was done; she was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily and discharged home on that dose awaiting the liver biopsy result. Later on this confirmed our diagnosis of AIH as it showed lobular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (fig. ), Councilman bodies and spotty necrosis. Bile duct damage and bridging periportal fibrosis were present (fig. ). In March 2013, the patient had improved clinically. Her liver enzymes were checked while she was still taking 60 mg prednisone daily with the following values: AST 360 IU/l, ALT 602 IU/l, ALP 92 IU/l, GGTP 398 IU/l and total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dl. After receiving the liver biopsy result, she was prescribed oral azathioprine 50 mg daily while tapering the prednisone dose. Her liver function was periodically checked with continuous improvement. In April 2013, she was taking both 20 mg prednisone and 50 mg azathioprine daily. In June 2013, the azathioprine was stopped and she was kept on oral prednisone 10 mg daily, which later on (in September 2013) was decreased to 5 mg daily. Her liver function has been always within the normal range since July 2013 with AST 40 IU/l, ALT 35 IU/l, ALP 37 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, GGTP 60 IU/l, total protein 6.8 g/dl and albumin 3.9 g/dl. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-6.3",
    "Upper Limit": "-5.7",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 29.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 29.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 29.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 29.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 29.0 mEq/L) = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 6.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 6.0 - 12 = -6.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -6.0 mEq/L.",

Laboratory findings on admission were significant for hemoglobin of 4.6 g/dL, lactate of 2.8, and INR of 3.9 with normal liver function tests (LFTs). Her CD4 count was 51/mm3, HIV viral load less than 20 and leukocyte count otherwise normal. Hemoglobin and hematocrit responded to blood transfusions but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient remained febrile and hypotensive despite coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acyclovir. Cultures remained unrevealing but her course was complicated by Clostridium difficile infection on day 4. On day 6 of hospitalization, she was transferred to the medical ICU requiring vasopressors and was intubated for worsening encephalopathy. MRI of the brain at this time suggested HIV encephalitis and abdominal CT showed splenomegaly and multiple hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen. She developed progressive oliguric renal failure for which hemodialysis was initiated on hospital day 9. Testing for viral pathogens revealed 64,000 copies of EBV DNA per mL, and serum ferritin was elevated at 2,512 ng/mL. Her platelet counts also fell gradually to 17,000/uL from normal levels on admission. HLH was suspected but treatment was not initiated as she only met four of the eight criteria for diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy resulted on day 11 of hospitalization, confirming the presence of hemophagocytic cells. She was immediately started on HLH-94 protocol with etoposide and dexamethasone. Despite treatment, the patient’s hypotension, acidosis, and renal failure worsened. She did not tolerate hemodialysis despite vasopressor support and the family agreed to withdraw care.

The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1.

    "problem": "<Context> A 68-year-old female was admitted to the hospital because of a 5-day history of left pleuritic chest pain. She had no other relevant medical history except for a ten-year history of hypertension. On admission, her blood pressure was 146/70 mm Hg and her body temperature was 36.9℃. Physical examination was unremarkable, and urinalysis did not reveal any abnormal findings. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit 32.7%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 6.9 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.74 mg/dL, sodium 130 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, total protein 5.6 g/dL, albumin 3.9 g/dL, and total cholesterol 167 mg/dL. According to chest X-ray, a pleural effusion was present in the left lower lobe. The pleural fluid (PF) was exudative, and PF analysis showed a pH of 7.4, total protein of 5800 mg/dL, albumin of 3200 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 679 IU/L, and glucose of 92 mg/dL. In addition, the white blood cell (WBC) count was 3879/mm3 with 99% mononuclear cells, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) was shown to be 104.0 IU/L in the PF. Pleural biopsy and pleural cytology were negative for malignancy. Based on the exudative characteristics and the high ADA level in the PF, pleural tuberculosis was suspected and anti-tuberculosis treatment was started. Treatment comprised rifampicin 600 mg/day, isoniazid 300 mg/day, ethambutol hydrochloride 1200 mg/day, and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/day.\nDuring the 4-week anti-tuberculosis therapy regimen, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, general weakness, and edema. Urinalysis revealed 4+proteinuria with a few transitional epithelial cells, some coarse granular casts, and many mucous threads. According to a 24-h urine collection, protein and albumin values were 9.2 and 6.2 g/day, respectively. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, WBC 5490/mm3, BUN 33.2 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.36 mg/dL, creatinine clearance 39 mL/min, total protein 5.6 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase 282 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 282 IU/L, normal total bilirubin, and a total cholesterol of 283 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody and P-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and C-ANCA were all negative with normal serum complement levels.\nAccording to a renal biopsy, MCD was present with focal thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (). Non-sclerotic glomeruli were normocellular without mesangial expansion, and the tubules showed minimal atrophy and mild focal tubular injury. Additionally, the interstitium was widened by minimal fibrosis, and no depositions of immunoglobulins or complement components were observed in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy showed the podocyte foot processes to be diffusely effaced ().\nDue to toxic hepatitis, rifampicin and isoniazid were discontinued, but ethambutol hydrochloride and pyrazinamide were maintained. Moxifloxacin was added after 1 week, and isoniazid was added after 2 weeks. The pleural tuberculosis was well controlled with isoniazid, ethambutol hydrochloride, and moxifloxacin thereafter.\nWhen her diagnosis was confirmed to be MCD, we determined to use steroid therapy at first. However, she was afraid of adverse effects of steroid treatment and asked us to observe closely. Moreover, we found out that heavy proteinuria was developed after using anti-tuberculosis agents. In addition, hepatitis also occurred after anti-tuberculosis agents started, and then we had to stop rifampicin and isoniazid agents. Fortunately, she improved spontaneously without steroid use only after quitting rifampicin. Therefore, we observed and followed up continuously. Her nausea, vomiting, and general edema improved and her body weight recovered from 68 kg to 63 kg at 3 weeks after rifampicin discontinuation, and a random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.14 at 8 weeks (). Furthermore, her serum albumin and cholesterol levels were shown to be 3.9 g/dL and 180 mg/dL, respectively, 8 weeks after stopping rifampicin. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 68 years old. The patient's is a Female. The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45. The patient's weight is 63.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 23-year-old African-American man with past medical history of G6PD-deficiency and obesity presented with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain that improved upon leaning forward and scant hemoptysis of two weeks duration. He was notably hypertensive to the 220/110 s mmHg and tachycardic to the 120 s, but had a preserved respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Physical exam was remarkable for bilateral diffuse wheezing throughout all lung fields. Other parts of the exam including cardiovascular, nasopharynx, skin and musculoskeletal systems were unremarkable. Additional pertinent history was remarkable only for marijuana smoking. Electrocardiogram was unremarkable except for left atrial enlargement. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, cardiomegaly, and mediastinal enlargement suggestive of bulky hilar adenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with contrast was performed which was negative for pulmonary embolism, but revealed bilateral centrilobular opacities, hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a trivial pericardial effusion (Fig. a). Initial laboratory diagnostics were significant for acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine of 2.03 (mg/dL), trace proteinuria, troponin elevation to 0.232 (ng/mL), and a D-Dimer of 1.3 (mcg/mL). Complete blood count revealed no leukocytosis, but concomitant eosinophilia, with no evidence of anemia. The patient was subsequently admitted to the medicine wards and a therapeutic regimen of antihypertensive agents as well as intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia was initiated.\nAdditional diagnostic evaluation demonstrated marked elevation of CRP (80 mg/L) and ESR (67 mm/hr). Pheochromocytoma screening with serum catecholamines and metanephrines was negative. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40%, moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and trivial pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade or pulmonary artery hypertension. Despite continuation of antibiotics for pneumonia and adjunctive heart failure management, the patient’s clinical status failed to improve. In the setting of an unremarkable infectious workup and concern for an autoimmune etiology, the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily. The patient remained symptomatic, experiencing episodic chest pain and shortness of breath, with blood pressure lability. Repeat chest X-ray showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. Subsequently, ANA resulted weakly positive (1:160) with a homogenous pattern and rheumatoid factor (RF) returned negative.\nOn the fifth day of admission, antibiotics were discontinued in light of negative cultures and lack of significant clinical improvement. The patient’s blood pressure was noted to be slightly improved with addition of prednisone however remained poorly controlled on multiple medications (Fig. ). Autoimmune panel including ANCA (MPO/p-ANCA, and PR3/c-ANCA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, C3 and C4 complements, anti-histone antibody, as well as other autoimmune related factors and infectious serologies returned negative or within normal limits (Table ). Renal ultrasound and renal artery duplex were performed which did not reveal any evidence of hydronephrosis or renal artery stenosis, respectively. A repeat high-resolution chest CT scan was obtained, both in supine and prone positions, to help differentiate early interstitial lung disease from intra-alveolar processes, which showed persistent intra-alveolar opacities without any change on prone position (Fig. b). Over the course of the following days, the patient reported improvement in his symptomatology and his blood pressure improved, therefore he was taken off prednisone on the sixth day. Pulmonary function testing was performed in the setting of bilateral hilar adenopathy and fixed infiltrates, which revealed a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern. He eventually underwent lung biopsy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with right medial lobe wedge resection and was subsequently discharged with instructions to follow up with rheumatology for planned initiation of rituximab. The histopathological results of his lung biopsy demonstrated extensive intra-alveolar hemorrhage with linear polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell collections in alveolar septa and capillaritis without any evidence of granulomatous changes, indicative of microscopic polyangiitis (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry on lung biopsy samples was not performed and renal biopsy was deferred to outpatient rheumatology.\nUnfortunately, the patient was lost to follow up, failing to attend any of the scheduled appointments. He was subsequently readmitted six months later with similar symptoms, and once again found to be in hypertensive emergency, complicated by acute decompensated heart failure. Repeat echocardiogram revealed a further decline in his ejection fraction to 25% and a trivial pericardial effusion. Rheumatology was consulted and recommended pulse steroid therapy with methylprednisolone 250 mg four times a day for three days, which led to significant improvement in symptoms and blood pressure. Repeat ANCA and autoimmune serological workup remained negative. Following initiation of pulse steroid therapy, he underwent renal biopsy. The biopsy contained forty glomeruli, six of which were globally sclerotic. One glomerulus had segmental sclerosis. There were changes suggestive of microangiopathic injury in some arteries and glomeruli, such as bloodless glomeruli and mild intimal myxoid changes in arteries, with associated acute tubular injury. Focal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were estimated to involve approximately 10% of the cortex. No evidence of crescents or granulomatous changes were observed. Immunofluorescence was unremarkable, with only non-specific linear glomerular and tubular basement membrane staining for IgG, kappa, lambda, and albumin, indicative of pauci-immunity. Electron microscopy demonstrated segmental effacement of podocyte foot processes (40%) with vacuolation and microvillous transformation of the podocyte cytoplasm, ischemic-type capillary wall wrinkling, and subendothelial electron lucent widening (Fig. ). He was subsequently discharged on a steroid taper with plans for outpatient rituximab. Despite extensive education about his condition he was once again lost to follow up and missed appropriate treatment.\nOver the course of the next year, he was readmitted on multiple occasions and eventually progressed to dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease. His two most recent admissions were characterized by pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudoaneurysm complicated by retroperitoneal hematoma and cardiac tamponade, respectively. With respect to his pancreatitis, he presented in the context of acute onset abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Laboratory diagnostics demonstrated an elevated lipase (3400), normal triglycerides, and a negative IgG4 serology. Abdominal CT was significant for peripancreatic fat stranding and inflammatory changes without evidence of gallstones or biliary ductal dilation. He denied recent alcohol use. Pancreatitis course was further complicated by retroperitoneal hematoma, which was found to be secondary to a 7 mm pancreatic pseudoaneurysm rupture, as revealed on repeat abdominal CT angiography (Fig. ). He was managed conservatively and subsequently discharged. One month later he presented with dyspnea, chest pain and nausea, and was found to have large pericardial effusion with an acute decrease in ejection fraction to 10% (Fig. ). He underwent pericardiocentesis with removal of one liter of serosanguineous fluid. Fluid analysis was indicative of hemorrhagic etiology and negative for malignancy. On review of most recent outpatient records, the patient has been maintained on high-dose suppressive steroid therapy with plans for initiation of Rituximab or Cyclophosphamide. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's HEART score? </Question>",

CT of the brain was not performed due to the unstable clinical condition of our patient. He was intubated due to deterioration of consciousness and cerebral edema. Mannitol (0.5 mg/kg) was subsequently administered and 3% NaCl was given intravenously to maintain a hypernatremic state for purposes of decreasing intracranial pressure. Normal saline was carefully given and regular insulin was then started and titrated to 0.2 units/kg/hr according to patient blood sugar levels. He was out of DKA as defined by pH > 7.3, bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L, and serum ketone negative, within 24 hours. Lipid profiles were analyzed on the second day of admission, with results revealing triglyceride of 9,810 mg/dL, cholesterol 705 mg/dL, LDL 254 mg/dL, and HDL 6 mg/dL. Patient had no abdominal pain and serum amylase was 57 IU/L. Therefore, acute pancreatitis was excluded. Triglyceride level was reduced to 377 mg/dL within 9 days of admission () without the use of antilipid medication. Our patient was extubated within 2 days of admission after recovery from DKA and cerebral edema. His father's lipid profiles showed cholesterol of 215 mg/dL, triglyceride 111 mg/dL, LDL 144 mg/dL, and HDL 50 mg/dL. His mother's lipid profiles showed cholesterol of 167 mg/dL, triglyceride 75 mg/dL, LDL 101 mg/dL, and HDL 47 mg/dL.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, T1DM treatment with basal-bolus insulin regimen was commenced.

    "problem": "<Context> A 59-year-old male with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was referred for catheter ablation due to an increasing frequency of symptomatic AF episodes over the past year despite antiarrhythmic drug (ADD) therapy. After discussion of the risks and benefits of catheter ablation and different modalities for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI), the patient opted to undergo visually guided laser balloon (LB) ablation. A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (55%) and left atrial (LA) volume index (32.1 mL/min).\nAfter informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory and placed under general anesthesia for the procedure. Percutaneous femoral venous access was obtained using ultrasound guidance and modified Seldinger technique. An 8-French (Fr) intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter (AcuNav™; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was advanced into the right atrium (RA) and a three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic shell was created of the RA, LA, superior vena cava (SVC), and coronary sinus (CS) ostium and integrated into the CARTO® 3 mapping system (CARTOSOUND®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). A five-spline multielectrode mapping catheter (Pentaray®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was advanced to the inferior vena cava (IVC)–RA junction and a 3D fast anatomic map of the RA cavity, ostium, proximal body of the CS, and SVC was created. A detailed map of the course of the right phrenic nerve (PN) was also developed during high-output pacing from the mapping catheter’s distal poles beginning at the right innominate artery–SVC junction and sweeping down to the SVC-RA junction (. Next a 7-Fr decapolar catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was positioned in the CS using electroanatomic mapping (EAM) guidance and previously acquired anatomy as visual landmarks.\nThe multispline mapping catheter was then exchanged for a long 0.032-in J-wire, which was positioned in the SVC under ICE visualization (ie, high in the RA with a posterior tilt) without the use of fluoroscopy (. A 63-cm-long SL1 sheath (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) was advanced over the long 0.032-in J-wire into the SVC under ICE visualization. The 0.032-in J-wire was then exchanged for a BRK-1 transseptal needle (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA), and brief fluoroscopy was used to confirm that the tip of the transseptal needle did not extend beyond the tip of the SL1 dilator. The proximal end of the BRK-1 needle apparatus was connected to alligator cables (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) and a pin box to facilitate live tracking of the needle tip on the CARTO® 3 mapping system (CARTOSOUND®; Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). Under EAM guidance, the transseptal assembly was pulled down from the SVC onto the fossa ovalis (. The presence of interatrial septal tenting was visually confirmed on ICE imaging in the plane of the PVs. Successful puncture of the interatrial septum with the BRK-1 needle was confirmed on ICE by the presence of bubbles within the LA, and the SL1 was advanced into the LA. The BRK-1/dilator assembly was exchanged for the multispline mapping catheter, and a 3D map of the LA and PVs was created.\nThe multispline mapping catheter was removed, and an Amplatz super stiff guidewire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was advanced through the SL1 sheath and placed into the left superior PV (LSPV) under ICE imaging (. While maintaining constant ICE visualization of this wire in the LSPV, the SL1 sheath was exchanged for a 12-Fr steerable sheath-dilator assembly (CardioFocus, Marlborough, MA, USA). The LB catheter (HeartLight Excalibur™; CardioFocus, Marlborough, MA, USA) was advanced through the 12-Fr sheath and into the LA cavity. Under ICE visualization, the soft, atraumatic tip of the LB catheter was directly advanced into an upper branch of the LSPV without tactile resistance (. The catheter’s balloon was then manually inflated under endoscopic and ICE visualization (. The ideal antral position of the equatorial surface of the LB was confirmed on ICE by the presence of the balloon’s proximal end within the LA cavity and by endoscopic landmark visualization (. If the position of the catheter’s distal end interferes with obtaining coaxial alignment of the balloon with the PV ostium, the LB can be pulled back into the LA cavity while still inflated ( and the PV can be reengaged by gently pushing forward with the LB while viewing on ICE until the tip is advanced into a different side branch.\nFollowing delivery of a circumferential lesion set around the LSPV antrum, the LB was deflated and withdrawn from the LSPV. Under ICE visualization, the sheath was deflected until the catheter tip was pointing directly toward the ostium of the left inferior PV (LIPV) (. The LB catheter was advanced into the LIPV and inflated until antral balloon contact was confirmed with endoscopic and ICE visualization (. A similar circumferential laser lesion set was created to isolate the LIPV (.\nTo cannulate the right inferior PV (RIPV) under ICE visualization, we utilized a “hockey-stick” maneuver. First, the LB catheter was withdrawn until just the atraumatic tip was exposed beyond the 12-Fr sheath. While still facing the left PVs, we maximally deflected the sheath and withdrew the assembly toward the interatrial septum while maintaining a curve on the sheath. To avoid damage to the LA posterior wall during this maneuver, brief fluoroscopy was used to reconfirm that the LB catheter’s soft tip remained beyond the sheath prior to RIPV cannulation. Using ICE, the 12-Fr sheath was rotated clockwise until the sheath–catheter assembly was visualized in the same plane as the RIPV (. Following cannulation of the RIPV and inflation of the LB using the aforementioned steps, the decapolar catheter was removed from the CS and aligned with previously tagged sites of PN capture. While pacing at a suprathreshold output, an antral circumferential RIPV lesion set was created while simultaneously limiting the likelihood of PN injury by monitoring the compound motor action potential amplitude and manually assessing diaphragmatic movement.\nFor cannulation of the right superior PV (RSPV), the ICE catheter was advanced superiorly with slight posterior deflection until the vein was visualized. After withdrawing the LB catheter from the RIPV, deflection on the 12-Fr sheath was released and the sheath–catheter assembly was slowly clocked until the LB catheter was seen in the same plane as the RSPV on ICE (. The LB catheter was then advanced into the RSPV and circumferential ablation was performed while monitoring for PN injury as described above.\nAfter LB ablation of all four PVs was visually completed, the LB catheter was exchanged for a multielectrode mapping catheter and a postablation high-density voltage map was created of the LA and PVs, confirming entrance block (. Pacing from the multielectrode catheter positioned at the ostium of each PV was used to demonstrate exit block. The LB catheter–sheath assembly was then removed from the LA. After checking the final activated clotting time, protamine was administered intravenously and all remaining sheaths and catheters were removed. Hemostasis was obtained with manual pressure.\nThere were no complications during the procedure. The final ICE images of the pericardial space revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion. The patient resumed his direct oral anticoagulation regimen the same evening and was discharged from the hospital the following day. His AAD was discontinued three months after ablation and he experienced no recurrence of AF during eight months of follow-up.\nOverall, the total procedure time was 146 minutes and the LA dwell time was 59 minutes. The fluoroscopy setting was 7.5 frames per second. The fluoroscopy time required to obtain transseptal access was 0.3 minutes. The total fluoroscopy time in the LA to accomplish PVI and confirm bidirectional block of all four PVs was 0.2 minutes. Thus, the total procedural fluoroscopy time was 0.5 minutes. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

Two years prior, the patient had undergone a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy at an outside hospital for an elevated PSA of 7 ng/mL (normal <4 ng/mL) and was found to have a Gleason score of 6. The patient elected to pursue surveillance, and in the following year, his PSA was 5 ng/mL. One month prior to presentation at our facility, the PSA was 6 ng/mL. Four days prior to presentation, the patient had undergone a repeat TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in the other hospital's urological procedure room. No immediate complications were encountered, so the patient was sent home. Several hours later, he developed lightheadedness and bright red blood per rectum. Upon returning to the outside hospital, he developed syncope and was taken to their Emergency Department, where he had ongoing bright red blood per rectum. The hemoglobin was found to have decreased from a preprocedural level of 12.9 g/dL (normal, 13.5??7.5 g/dL) to 9.7 g/dL. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed active bleeding in the rectum. The patient was observed, and his bleeding appeared to self-resolve. He was not given blood products and was discharged on the next day, 3 days prior to his presentation at our medical center.\nOn the evening of the fourth day postprocedure, the patient again developed lightheadedness and bright red blood per rectum. He was brought to our Emergency Department for further evaluation. He had not taken any medications. His temperature was 36.3℃, his heart rate 110 per minute, his blood pressure 109/62 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. On physical examination, he appeared diaphoretic and pale; no abdominal tenderness was found. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL. The platelets, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time were within their normal ranges. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed active bleeding in the anterior rectum. Over the next 12 hours, the patient had eight episodes of large-volume bright red blood per rectum and clots. He received seven units of blood and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Although the patient was alert and oriented at the time of presentation, he subsequently developed syncope with poor arousability and was intubated in our intensive care unit for airway protection. A 500-mL tap water enema was administered, and he underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy.\nOn sigmoidoscopy, bright red blood and clots were noted from the rectum to 15 cm of intubation, where normal mucosa was visualized. On the anterior aspect of the rectum, at 1 to 2 cm from the dentate line, an approximately 3-mm ulcerated lesion was noted overlying a raised lesion that was pulsatile (). Six mililiters of 0.0001% epinephrine solution was injected circumferentially around this lesion, with immediate brisk bleeding noted at the injection sites. Although clipping and/or cautery were initially considered for hemostasis, on retroflexion, the lesion was apparently contiguous with what appeared to be a large internal hemorrhoid (). As such, band ligation (Speedband Superview Super 7, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) was performed using a single band around the site of the ulcerated lesion, with successful hemostasis being achieved (). After the procedure, the patient had no further signs of bleeding and showed stable hemoglobin levels on serial testing.

Seventeen years prior to admission, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia in another hospital. One year ago, he was admitted to this hospital with general weakness, and a bone marrow biopsy showed leukemia recurrence. The bone marrow biopsy revealed acute pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), group II with aberrant expression of CD33. Upon fluorescence in situ hybridization, p16 (CEP9) deletion on chromosome 9p21 was detected. After reinduction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisolone, daunorubicin, and L-asparaginase (VPDL), he achieved a hematological but not a cytogenetic response. Upon admission, no specific sign was present except tachypnea, (respiratory rate 36 breaths/min). Blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 100 bpm, and body temperature was 36.9℃.

The complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell of 3,200/µL, hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 83,000/µL. The differential count showed 61% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 11% immature cells, 1% band neutrophils, and no basophils, eosinophils or monocytes. The coagulation profile was within the normal range. Blood chemistry showed 17 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.8 mg/dL creatinine, 4.5 g/dL albumin, 8 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 5 IU/L alanine aminotransferase, 0.67 mg/dL total bilirubin, and 302 IU/L lactate dehydrogenase. C-reactive protein was 1.34 mg/dL. The random plasma glucose level in the emergency room was 179 mg/dL. Peripheral blood morphology examination showed 20% blasts with some spherocytes and tear drop cells. Serum thiamine level was 18.60 ng/mL (normal range, 21.3-81.9 ng/mL). A chest radiography showed no active infiltrative lesions.\nContinuous bicarbonate replacement therapy was performed to maintain cardiovascular stability. Arterial blood gas analysis improved to pH 7.346, PaCO2 20.1 mmHg, PaO2 135.2 mmHg, H CO3- 10.7 mmol/L, and base excess of -12.3 mmol/L. The blood lactate level was not checked in the emergency room. On day 3 of admission, a bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the result showed that ALL was sustained. Re-induction chemotherapy with vincristine and prednisone (VP) regimen was started immediately. Lactate was 11.6 mmol/L on day 2 of chemotherapy. After 3 weeks, lactate level decreased to 4.6 mmol/L.\nAfter finishing the chemotherapeutic schedule, leukemic blasts still showed on the follow-up bone marrow examination, and the number and percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood started to increase. As the number of immature cells in peripheral blood increased, the lactic acid began to increase again.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 4.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 4.5 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 4.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 4.5 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.5 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 4.5 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 4.5 mEq/L) = 26.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 26.5 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 4.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 26.5 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.5 (in g/dL)) = 25.25 mEq/L.

As per routine protocol of the shelter, imidacloprid/moxidectin (Advantage Multi for Cats; Bayer) was applied to the kitten and a 5 day course of fenbendazole was initiated at 50 mg/kg PO q24h.\nThe kitten was placed in foster care once able to ambulate 5 days later, and although it continued to improve neurologically, respiratory signs of tachypnea, cough and wheezing suddenly worsened in frequency and severity 9 days later. On day 10, the cat presented to the University of California, Davis, William R Pritchard Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital for a further diagnostic work-up. On physical examination the kitten weighed 1.7 kg, heart rate was 180 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 70 breaths per minute with wheezing and rectal temperature was 103.0ºF. Complete blood count results included a mild normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anaemia, likely age related (haematocrit 27%; reference interval [RI] 30–50%), and a white blood cell count of 6098/μl with neutrophils (4025/μl; RI 2000–9000/μl), lymphocytes (1342/μl; RI 1000–7000/μl) and eosinophils (305/μl; RI 150–1100/μl) within RIs, and a slight left shift (band neutrophils 183/μl; RI 0/μl). Serum biochemistry results included hyperkalemia (5.3 mmol/l; RI 3.6–4.9 mmol/l), hypochloremia (115 mmol/l; RI 117–126 mmol/l), hyperphosphatemia (9.0 mg/dl; RI 3.2–6.3 mg/dl) and increased alanine aminotransferase (103 IU/l; RI 27–101 IU/l) and creatine kinase (722 IU/l; RI 73–260 IU/l).\nThoracic radiographs revealed a severe diffuse bronchointerstitial pulmonary pattern with peribronchial cuffing and ill-defined pulmonary nodules. Soft-tissue opacities dorsal to the carina and the second and third sternebrae were interpreted as lymphadenomegaly (). Differentials included infectious etiologies such as toxoplasmosis, feline infectious peritonitis and cryptococcosis. Serology was considered but was thought less likely to be helpful in the diagnosis. Parasitic pulmonary disease was considered less likely due to previous treatment with fenbendazole and neoplasia (lymphoma) was also lower on the differential list.\nGiven the severity of thoracic radiographic findings, the kitten was prepped for anesthesia to undergo a laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Premedication was provided with butorphanol 0.6 mg/kg (1.03 mg) subcutaneously, flow-by 100% oxygen was provided and induction was performed with alfaxalone 1.0 mg/kg (1.7 mg) and midazolam 0.3 mg/kg (0.5 mg) intravenously. A jet ventilator was used to provide oxygenation at 180 pulses per minute, and anaesthesia maintained with an alfaxalone constant rate infusion to effect (4.12 mg/kg infused). A 2.8mm outer diameter video-endoscope (Flex XC; Karl Storz Veterinary Endoscopy) was utilized for bronchoscopy. Moderate laryngeal, tracheal and bronchial hyperemia was noted along with excessive mucus accumulation (). BAL was performed in the left and right caudal lung lobes and was submitted for cytologic evaluation. Copious amounts of tracheal mucus were expectorated and a swab collected from the oropharynx was also submitted for cytologic evaluation.\nBAL fluid was hypercellular (1010 and 1100 cells/µl, right and left, respectively; RI 300–400/μl) with 62% and 50% neutrophils (normal 5–8%) and 22% and 25% eosinophils (normal <20%) (). Increased numbers of multinucleate giant cells, goblet cells and mast cells were also present, along with epithelial hyperplasia. Swabs of oropharyngeal mucus revealed a dense background of mucus with neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation, numerous free mucus granules and evidence of mineralization. Five large parasitic (helminth) larvae were observed on one slide (), including one that appeared to have a dorsal spine on the tail. The oropharyngeal sample was submitted to the University of Teramo for molecular identification of larvae. DNA was extracted using a commercially available kit (QIAgen Mini Kit; Qiagen), and nested PCR was performed targeting the ITS2 region of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior, as previously described. PCR was positive for A abstrusus at the 233 base-pair region and negative for T brevior at the 356 base-pair region ().\nThe kitten was discharged with application of a second dose of imidiclopid/moxidectin, and fenbendazole was prescribed at 50 mg/kg PO q24h for 10 days. Three weeks later, the kitten was doing clinically well at home but still coughing intermittently. Radiographs revealed marked resolution in the bronchial pattern with partial resolution of peribronchial cuffing and ill-defined nodules (). Fenbendazole was prescribed for an additional 5 days at 50 mg/kg/day. All respiratory signs had resolved at the time of ovariohysterectomy 3 weeks later, and radiographs 2 months after the final treatment were normal. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

He complained of pain in the hips, knees, shoulders, and right elbow ongoing for three days. It was progressively worsening with no precipitating factors. He denied any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitation, cough but did have mild shortness of breath.\nOn presentation, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 104 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 147/90 mmHg. A cardiovascular exam revealed normal heart sounds. A respiratory exam revealed expiratory wheeze but otherwise, no decreased breath sounds or rhonchi were noted. A joint exam showed no tenderness to palpation, warmth, or swelling of any of the joints; however, there was resistance to movement at the hip joints bilaterally due to pain.\nLabwork showed white cell count of 24.9 x109/L, hemoglobin 5.5 mg/dL, platelet 390 x109/L, sodium 134, potassium 3.9, blood\nurea nitrogen (BUN) 31, creatinine 1.7, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 344, procalcitonin <0.05, and normal urinalysis. Blood and urine cultures were sent - reticulocyte count >3%, haptoglobin<30 md/dL. Sickle solubility test returned positive indicating active sickling. He was admitted with the diagnosis of vaso-occlusive crisis and a workup for sepsis and the precipitating cause was sought. He received intravenous fluid resuscitation, packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and medication for pain control. However, despite the escalation of the pain control regimen, he was unable to ambulate and had persistent pain in his hips bilaterally. Despite lack of fever and absence of clinical signs of infection (swelling, warmth, tenderness), the persistently elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with worsening right hip pain and weakness, was concerning. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative for any growth.\nAutoimmune workup showed erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was mildly elevated to 24 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP) was borderline elevated, creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin were within normal limits. Autoimmune antibodies returned negative. Chest X-ray revealed pulmonary vascular congestion (Figure ). MRI of the right hip revealed lateral hip having peripherally enhancing soft tissue fluid collection extending into the right acetabular fossa and into the proximal femur, measuring approximately 5.3 x 14 x 20 cm enlarging soft tissue fluid collection (Figures -). These areas had low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and high signal intensity on fluid-sensitive sequences. These signals extended along the lateral aspect of the right hip with intraosseous femoral extension, alongside evidence of femoral and acetabular subacute osteomyelitis. These radiological findings were consistent with Brodie’s abscess.\nOrthopedic surgery was consulted for abscess drainage. During the operation, a large amount of pus was found within the thigh muscles, which was traced back and was seen extending from the bone. The abscess was debrided and irrigated, followed by antibiotic bead placement. Clindamycin was added to the antibiotic regimen. After the procedure, his leukocytosis improved drastically.\nWound samples from the abscess were sent for culture. The post-operative course was complicated by the re-accumulation of fluid. Repeat imaging revealed hematoma formation. It was managed conservatively with serial imaging, showing a receding size of the hematoma. Intra-operative culture report revealed the growth of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter koseri. Antibiotics were changed according to the cultures. The patient made a slow recovery thereafter and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for recuperation. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 39-year-old West African man who was a teacher was referred for weight loss and recent abdominal pain. He presented the following symptoms: generalized episodic abdominal pain of progressive onset that was relieved by diarrheal stools occasionally associated with rectal bleeding over the past 2 months. The patient had recurrent skin lesions of different ages on the lower limbs that had started to appear 6 months before the onset of abdominal pain. These lesions began with an inflammatory nodule that resolved within a few days with a pustule that ruptured quickly and spontaneously gave way to an ulceration whose diameter quickly reached several centimeters. The healing was spontaneous and left hypertrophic stigmata.\nThe patient was not a drinker or smoker and was of middle socioeconomic status. He had no personal or family medical history, especially cancer or blood or inflammatory disease. Upon admission, he had a body temperature of 37.4 °C, a pulse rate of 81 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 110/85 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a moderate general condition, moderately colored conjunctiva, pain in the left iliac fossa, and hypogastrium without a palpated mass. The result of his rectal examination was normal. His dermatological examination demostrated objectified large, circumferential scarring lesions on both lower limbs and progressive ulceration on the posterior side of the left thigh (Fig. ). His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15; he had no sensory or motor deficit, and the result of examination of his cranial nerves was normal. Biopsy of the progressive lesion showed a suppurative and inflammatory central zone with ulceration and neutrophil infiltration. The results of cytobacteriological (aerobic and anaerobic culture) and fungal studies were negative.\nWe concluded that these skin lesions were PG. Colonoscopy for the exploration of abdominal symptomatology revealed a necrotic and hemorrhagic budding lesion 20 cm from the anal margin, confirmed by contrast enema, which showed a narrowing of the lumen of the rectosigmoid junction. Biopsies taken during colonoscopy revealed an adenocarcinoma. An abdominopelvic computed tomographic scan revealed thickening of the rectosigmoid without associated metastases (Fig. ). The results of preoperative checkup (rhesus grouping; complete blood count; prothrombin time; activated cephalin time; tests for uremia, creatinemia, and glycemia; chest x-ray; and electrocardiogram) and liver checkup (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), total and direct bilirubin) were normal. A median subumbilical laparotomy confirmed a stenosing tumor of the rectosigmoid junction. A rectosigmoid carcinologic excision was performed with immediate colorectal anastomosis. Regular bandages were placed on the PG lesions. Postoperative treatment was initiated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 10 days and tramadol 50 mg three times daily for 5 days. The anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimen (using hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections) confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction (Fig. ). The tumor was classified as pT2N0M0 with negative excision margins. There were no postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. No adjuvant treatment was performed. Thirteen months after the operation, all the skin lesions had healed without reemergence of new lesions, and the patient did not have metastases or tumor recurrence. </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

His past medical history included anemia with intermittent pancytopenia diagnosed 10 years ago. Previous specialist hematologic assessment did not reveal an etiology. Two weeks prior, he believed that he sustained a spider bite while mowing the lawn during the month of August. The lesion began as a small papule less than 1 cm and then developed into a large blister on the left lower calf. Oral cloxacillin was initiated for one week; however, the lesion rapidly increased in size, began to ulcerate, and was extremely painful. He presented to the emergency room at a community hospital, febrile (38 degrees Celsius) with otherwise stable vitals. The documented area of necrosis measured 10 cm × 13 cm. Blood work showed ongoing pancytopenia (white blood cell count of 1.8 × 109/L, hemoglobin 100 g/L, platelets 88 × 109/L). He underwent urgent surgical debridement due to clinical concerns of a necrotizing process. Empiric ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and clindamycin were initiated. There was no intraoperative evidence of necrotizing fasciitis, purulence, or foul odour. Tissue cultures yielded methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the antibiotics were narrowed to cefazolin. Necrosis developed at the surgical margins and rapidly extended a further 3 cm over the next 3 days. A second surgical debridement was completed with the addition of a negative pressure dressing over the wound. The intraoperative tissue cultures yielded MSSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin was added to cefazolin. During the subsequent three days, the patient developed severe calf pain with an expanding hematoma and required urgent surgical exploration. No significant abnormalities were noted. Tissue cultures yielded the same mixture of organisms. Further extension of necrosis again was observed at the surgical margin, and a fourth surgical debridement extended his wound up to the popliteal fossa and down to the ankle. Microbiology yielded commensal flora. Histopathology showed skin necrosis, ulceration and inflammation of subcutaneous tissues, and neutrophilic dermal infiltration with abscess formation. All bacterial and fungal stains were negative, and there was no evidence of vasculitis. New necrotic lesions developed on the left medial malleolus and the plantar aspect of his first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. He was subsequently transferred to our centre for evaluation of an infectious etiology of progressive nonhealing necrotic skin lesions and assessment for potential limb amputation.\nOn initial assessment, the lesions were violaceous, painful, and necrotic with raised, irregular borders. The largest lesion extended circumferentially from the left tibial tuberosity to the ankle. Satellite lesions were noted at the medial and lateral malleoli and the base of the first MTP joint (). Investigations showed ongoing pancytopenia (leukocytes 2.3 × 109/L, hemoglobin 72 g/L, and platelets 64 × 109/L). His C-reactive protein level was 225 mg/L. A nuclear bone scan indicated osteomyelitis of the left first MTP joint. A bone marrow biopsy showed pancytopenia with possible hairy cells. Flow cytometry revealed a pattern consistent with hairy cell leukemia (HCL).\nBased on the clinical course of leg lesions exhibiting a pathergic phenomenon in response to skin trauma and nonresponse to multiple adequate courses of antimicrobial therapy and pathology showing sterile neutrophilic infiltration, combined with diagnosis of underlying hematological malignancy, we diagnosed him clinically with pyoderma gangrenosum. All further debridement was suspended, and negative pressure dressings were stopped. Due to the open nature of the wound, imaging consistent with osteomyelitis and impending chemotherapy, empiric piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin were initiated. A bone biopsy of the left MTP grew E. coli (Amp C) and P. aeruginosa. Antibiotics were switched to ertapenem and ciprofloxacin. He received seven days of cladribine chemotherapy plus prednisone for HCL and continued antibiotics for osteomyelitis of his left MTP.

A 24-h Holter monitor displayed a dominant rhythm as AF. His medical history included hypertension and coronary heart disease treated with nifedipine controlled-release tablets (30 mg q.d.) and clopidogrel (75 mg q.d.). His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 5, in the high-risk category of thrombosis and his HAS-BLED score was 5, in the category of high bleeding risk. Although there was no strong case against OAC use, neurologists indicated a high risk of cerebral bleeding under anticoagulant therapy. Upon confirming no thrombosis in the LAA and left atrium, a LAAC operation was successfully performed on the patient using a 33-mm Watchman occluder device (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) that was placed accurately on the LAA with no immediate complications.

He was the first child of related Egyptian parents. The pregnancy was uneventful and his mother had not been treated with any drugs. The existence of other children with this condition had not previously been mentioned. He was delivered at term by Caesarean section with a birth weight of 3.4kg, and cried immediately after delivery. He required admission to the special care baby unit shortly after birth for hypoglycemia; his blood sugar levels were easily maintained on 10% dextrose and then on milk feeds.\nOn examination, our patient’s weight was 3.5kg (below the third percentile), he was dehydrated, his blood pressure was 70/40mmHg, and he had no hyperpigmentation or dysmorphic features. A genital examination revealed distal penile hypospadias with chordee and normal testes (Figure ). Laboratory investigation results showed a serum sodium level of 119mmol/L, potassium 6.5mmol/L and glucose 55mg/dL. Blood gas analysis results showed a pH of 7.31, bicarbonate ion level of 16.9mmHg and a base excess of 6.3mmol/L. His cortisol level was 0.3μg/dL (normal range: 2.8 to 23μg/dL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone level, 512pg/mL (normal range: 6 to 48pg/mL). An adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test did not cause a rise in his cortisol level. His 17-hydroxyprogesterone level was 0.005ng/mL (normal range: 0.03 to 0.9ng/mL), androstenedione 0.012ng/mL (normal range: 0.1 to 0.17ng/mL), dehydroepiandrosterone 6ng/mL (normal range: 50 to 480ng/mL), plasma renin activity 90ng/mL/hour (normal range: 2.35 to 37ng/mL/hour) and aldosterone 31pg/mL (normal range: 50 to 900pg/mL). His triglyceride and creatine kinase levels were normal. His blood karyotype was 46,XY. A magnetic resonance imaging study of his abdomen revealed small adrenal glands and a normal genitourinary system.\nBased on the clinical history and investigative findings, a provisional diagnosis of congenital adrenal hypoplasia associated with hypospadias was made. A molecular genetic study detected hemizygous mutations (p.Arg327Pro). A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) study of our patient’s mother confirmed her to be heterozygous for the same mutation. No mutation was found in his father. With the identification of a hemizygous mutation in the DAX-1 gene, a clinical diagnosis of X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia was confirmed. Further, mutation c.325delG in the MAMLD1 gene was detected, which may point to a possible etiology of hypospadias in our patient’s case. He was started on hydrocortisone at a dose of 10mg/m2/day and fludrocortisone 0.05mg/day. After three weeks of treatment the vomiting stopped, his weight was 4.1kg and his blood sugar, sodium, potassium and cortisol levels normalized. At the age of three months, a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) loading test was performed to evaluate his gonadal function. Basal values of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were <0.5IU/L and 0.41IU/L, respectively, which is within normal prepubertal limits. The hCG loading test resulted in a normal testosterone response from <0.05ng/mL to 4.24ng/mL.

    "problem": "<Context> A 45-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M5b) was subject to human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical relative HSCT for persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) (Fig. a). Apart from AML, the patient did not have any potentially relevant pre-existing conditions or medical treatments that may have impacted on bacterial colonization, clearance, or drug tolerance. The conditioning regimen comprised busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/q6h), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d), and semustine (250 mg/m2/d). Cyclosporin A, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil were used for GVHD prophylaxis, and levofloxacin and cefotaxime/sulbactam were given for antimicrobial prophylaxis. Prior to conditioning therapy, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) colonization, which has a high level of resistance to most routine antibiotics except for tigecycline (Additional file : Figure S1), was identified during routine rectal screening, while no decolonization strategies were performed. Six days after allo-HSCT, the patient developed neutropenic fever and the organism that grew in the blood culture was identified as CRKp which with the same resistance pattern as the previous one. CRKp bacteremia was successfully controlled by tigecycline. Hematopoietic stem cells were engrafted on day +11 and the patient discharged on day +20. During regular follow-up, the patient was in remission, but suffered chronic oral GVHD as it had not responded well to prednisone and tacrolimus. Thus, the patient remained in a very poor nutritional state, weighing approximately 45 kg (height = 168 cm).\nA second fever episode was accompanied by chills, cough, and expectoration on day +421. On this occasion, lung computerized tomography (CT) suggested pulmonary infection, and sputum and stool cultures were both positive for CRKp. This confirmed previous susceptibility tests, although blood cultures were negative. Infection was controlled by administering an antibiotic therapeutic regimen, including tigecycline. However, sputum and stool cultures remained positive for CRKp, indicating persistent CRKp colonization. Based on the same resistance patterns, we speculated that they were the same strain. Moreover, a previous study indicated that most bacteremia cases originated from the gut [, ]. Thus, FMT was planned to reduce the risk of infection and improve future quality of life. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He was noted to have tumor nodules of size 20 mm in diameter, located in segment 8, on a follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) and had undergone partial liver resection 7 years previously. Based on the 8th Union for International Cancer Control classification of HCC, the tumor was classified as pT1N0M0 stage 1. Seven months after the first surgery, abdominal CT revealed recurrent HCC with nodules 10 mm in diameter, in segment 6 of the liver (Figure ). When laparotomy was performed, a peritoneal mass was found that was not apparent preoperatively; therefore, partial liver resection and peritoneal tumor resection were performed (Figure and ). The peritoneal tumor with peritoneal metastasis of HCC was diagnosed based on histopathological findings. Fourteen months after the first surgery, abdominal CT revealed a tumor nodule 32 mm in diameter in the pelvis, which was diagnosed as a peritoneal recurrence of HCC (Figure ). We determined that the recurrent tumor was solitary and decided to perform tumor resection. However, many small peritoneal nodules were found at the time of laparotomy, and radical resection was impossible (Figure ). Subsequently, the patient was followed up by the department of gastroenterology of our hospital, and 16 mo after the initial resection of HCC, administration of sorafenib of 400 mg/d was started. Since he developed a grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, the dosage was reduced to 200 mg/d. The administration was continued for 54 mo without any other major adverse events, and the disease was well controlled. Seventy months after the first surgery, he was admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting.\nThe patient’s history was significant for extensive gastrectomy for duodenal ulcer at the age of 22 years. In addition, he had a history of hypertension since the age of 65, for which he was on treatment with amlodipine besilate (10 mg/d) and azilsartan (20 mg/d).\nThe patient’s social history consisted of a 40-pack year history and an alcohol intake of 350 mL beer per day. He had discontinued smoking and drinking alcohol 10 years previously. There was no history of cancer or liver disease in his family.\nThe height and weight of the patient at admission were 172 cm and 52 kg, respectively. There were no abnormalities in the vital signs. The abdomen was soft and slightly swollen. Tenderness was noted in the right lower abdomen.\nNo abnormal findings were found other than a high C-reactive protein level (4.95 mg/dL) in blood biochemical tests. Liver function tests revealed a class A Child-Pugh score.\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed a well-defined, rounded, enhancing endoluminal tumor in the small intestine, leading to intussusception and small bowel obstruction (Figure ).

An adolescent boy (175 cm, 60 kg) tied up the patient and jumped on her belly and kicked her several times. Heart rate and blood pressure were in the normal range.\nThe first blood tests showed increased plasma lipase (10 N) and liver cytolysis (10 N) without cholestasis or haemostasis disorders, suggesting acute posttraumatic pancreatitis. Furthermore, biological results showed metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap and normal plasma lactate level and acute renal failure (BUN: 25 mmol/L, serum creatinine: 503 umol/L). There were no electrolyte disturbances, but there were proteinuria (240 mg/mmol creatU) and hypoalbuminaemia (25 g/L), normal phosphate and calcium levels, increased LDH (3826 UI/L) and CPK (924 UI/L), and microscopic hematuria without myoglobinuria. There was no evidence for abdominal compartment syndrome.\nShe had normocytic anemia (Hb: 10.4 g/dL), without schistocytes, and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP: 311 mg/L and leucocytes: 24 × 109/L including 20 × 109/L neutrophils and fibrinogen at 7.1 g/L).\nA CT scan performed 12 hours after initial presentation () revealed a haemoperitoneum without pneumoperitoneum, an increase of pancreatic head size, and a heterogeneous and bilateral diminished enhancement of the kidney, suggestive of bilateral renal necrosis.\nA second CT scan was performed on day 7 (), showing a bilateral pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal effusion and persistence of lesions compatible with infarction in multiple zones of the renal parenchyma, with a patchy distribution. No artery dissection and no thrombosis were identified. A unilateral sign of left renal arterial thrombosis was suspected but identified as an artefact because there was no blood flow interruption.\nA Doppler sonography on day 15 confirmed the integrity of the blood flow, especially at the renal artery ostium. Doppler sonography was repeated several times during the first three months after initial presentation and blood flow remained normal.\nAs no causative lesion could be identified on vascular CT scans, we performed a renal biopsy on day 7, which revealed complete ischemic necrosis of the renal parenchyma, affecting the proximal and distal tubules, but also the glomeruli and interstitial oedema.\nA complete immunologic and viral work-up was negative. Renal failure with oliguria and hyperkalemia (creatinine max: 700 umol/L on day 5) required three hemodialysis sessions between day 5 and day 13. On day 18, she became polyuric requiring IV hydration. We noted a progressive improvement of her renal function with a stable serum creatinine level at 120 umol/L (eGFR: 65 ml/min/1.73 m2) after three months with normal blood pressure.\nAbdominal pain decreased until day 30, and plasma lipase normalized after three months.\nA thrombophilia work-up was performed after normalisation of inflammation parameters, and it showed an isolated deficiency in S protein (25%).\nUltrasound of the supra-aortic trunks and cardiac ultrasound were performed in order to rule out an embolic cause for renal ischemic necrosis.

Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining and Gram staining were all negative. Isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide with pyridoxine were administered. On hospital day 3, we learned that yeast was growing in the initial pericardial fluid culture so we added intravenous fluconazole. On hospital day 4, Candida parapsilosis was identified in the initial pericardial fluid culture. The amount of fluid drained from the pericardial catheter decreased to 70 mL/day, but his fever persisted. We learned that gram-positive bacterium was growing in the pericardial fluid drained on the first hospital day. We used vancomycin and ciprofloxacin in addition to fluconazole as treatment for pyogenic pericarditis. On hospital day 7, the fever developed daily, and vital signs included a body temperature of 38.1℃, blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg, heart rate of 98 beats/min and respiratory rate of 18/min. Chest radiography showed that the cardiac silhouette had decreased in size but that pneumopericardium had developed (). Subsequent chest CT image showed that pneumopericardium newly developed and the pericardial wall became more thickened and septated (). We switched vancomycin and ciprofloxacin with vancomycin and ertapenem for the uncontrolled, mixed infection because of the pneumopericardium. On hospital day 9, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Streptococcus anginosus in addition to C. parapsilosis were identified from the initial pericardial fluid culture. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and Prevotella oralis were also determined to the causative organisms of pyogenic pericarditis in this case, isolated respectively from pericardial fluid drained on hospital day 4 and hospital day 7. At this point, we understood that the multiple organisms in the pericardial fluid would be from the oral cavity through a broncho-lymph nodal fistula and possibly a lymph nodal-pericardial fistula. Upon reviewing the chest CT image, we observed that the subcarinal lymph node with air density was shown to contact with the parietal pericardium at coronal section images (panel D in ). Because of persistent pericardial drainage, pericardial thickening, and probable broncho-lymph node-pericardial fistula, a pericardiectomy was performed on hospital day 10. Pus, inflammatory material, and multiple septations were observed within the pericardium during the procedure, and irrigation with suction and removal of septations were performed for smooth drainage of the pericardial fluid. There was neither gross pericardial fistula nor evidence of mediastinitis. In order to identify the suspected tracheobronchial fistula, an air leakage test was performed, but no leakage was observed. The thickened pericardium and epicardium were removed (mostly on the anterior right ventricle side). Therefore, subcarinal and paratracheal lymph nodes were not dissected. Pericardial tissue biopsy revealed acute and chronic inflammation with liquefactive necrosis. The patient began to improve postoperatively. TB cultures of the pericardial fluid were all negative. One month after admission, the patient was discharged with oral antifungal, antibiotic and anti-TB medication. We stopped amoxicillin/clavulanic acid after three months and fluconazole after six months, but patient remained on anti-TB medication. Six months after discharge, the patient returned to normal activity including playing soccer, and his heart rate was around 70 beats/min. Echocardiography showed no cardiac relaxation abnormality, although the ejection fraction was minimally decreased. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CURB-65 score? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "2",
    "Upper Limit": "2",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points. The patient is 17 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0. Because the patient does not have confusion, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the score at 0. The concentration of BUN is 7.2 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is less than or equal to 19 mg/dL and so 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total at 0. The patient's respiratory rate is 40 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because at least one of these statements is true, 1 point is added to score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient's Curb-65 score is 2.",

She worked at an iron factory for 4 years without known exposure to asbestos. She had no history of pain, abdominal mass, significant weight loss, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or constitutional symptoms. In addition, she had no other relevant past medical and surgical history or no significant drug history. Her travel, family and social histories were unremarkable.\nOn presentation, she was non-anemic, non-icteric, her blood pressure was 139/84 mmHg, heart rate 87 beats/min and temperature 36.8°C. Peripheral lymph nodes were not palpable. The physical examination revealed that her abdomen was soft and non-tender but much distended. No masses were palpable, but massive ascites was pointed out. Laboratory analysis revealed thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminaemia and elevated C-reactive protein. The white blood cell count, erythrocyte count, renal function tests and level of serum electrolytes were normal. Liver function test yielded elevated level of ALP (292 IU/L) and LDH (159 IU/L). However, AST, ALT, γ-GTP, AMY levels were normal. Serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were also normal. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen125 (CA125), and CYFRA in serum were found to be within normal limit. Serum KL-6 was examined for early detection of interstitial pneumonia which might be a potential adverse effect of chemotherapy. It was unexpectedly elevated at 9000 IU/mL (normal up to 500 IU/mL). CT scans revealed thickened greater omentum with massive ascites () but no lung tumor or interstitial pneumonia. FDG-PET scan demonstrated positivity in the peritoneum () and negativity in the ovary. Diagnostic paracentasis yielded yellow exudative fluid (Protein 5.2 g/dL), 1.036 specific gravity (normal up to 1.016) and showed 3610 total cells with predominance of mononuclear cells. CA125 and KL-6in ascites fluid was 86 U/L and 7500 U/mL, respectively. The level of hyaluronic acid in serum and peritoneal fluid was at 60 ng/mL and 11,900 ng/mL, respectively. Cytological examination suggested the possibility of peritoneal mesothelioma, but it was insufficient for the diagnosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy along with peritoneal biopsy was performed to obtain histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis for establishing the definitive diagnosis. Laparoscopy showed multiple yellowish small nodular lesions of the peritoneal surface and the thickened greater omentum. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain at low magnification revealed sheet like epithelioid tumor cells with monotonous and bland in appearance () and higher magnification showed oval shaped mesothelioma cells, with indistinct border, moderate cytoplasm, and prominent nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli (). Microscopic features were consistent with peritoneal mesothelioma with epithelioid type. In addition, immunohistochemical stains were performed with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method (LSAB kit; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) using antibodies against AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), calretinine, WT-1, D2-40, CEA, MOC-31, Ber-EP4, and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. Staining procedures were conducted according to the manufactures’ instructions. The neoplastic cells showed strong positivity for AE1/AE3 (), moderate surface positivity for calretinine (), and surface and cytoplasmic positivity for CK 5/6, strong surface positivity for EMA, nucleonic positivity for WT-1, and weak surface positivity for D2-40 (data not shown). The tumor cells are completely negative for CEA, MOC-31, Ber-EP4, and TTF-1 (data not shown). All of these pathological results were compatible with peritoneal malignant mesothelioma with epithelioid type. Based on the serum elevation of KL-6, we examined KL-6 by immunohistochemistry using the anti KL-6 antibody (kindly provided by Eisai Co.) as described elsewhere, revealing distinct surface positivity for the mesothelioma cells (). Fuzzy and fluffy pattern was evident for ascitic tumor cells (). Sequential four regimens of palliative chemotherapy including gemcitabine plus cisplatin, paclitaxel plus carboplatin, irinotecan plus cisplatin, and pemetrexed plus cisplatin were administered and serum KL-6 level was monitored. After the chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, serum and ascitic KL-6 once dropped, but these levels increased in association with worsening of the disease. Despite chemotherapy, the patient died 32 months after the initial diagnosis. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, treated malignant neoplasm of the base of tongue, diverticular disease, essential hypertension, and previous provoked pulmonary embolism. Before admission, he was living independently with his wife. His exercise tolerance was restricted to 10 yards with the assistance of a walking stick. He was an exsmoker and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day but stopped smoking a few years previously.\nOn admission, he was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.2°C, oxygen saturations 98% on 28% FiO2, blood pressure 73/35 mmHg, and pulse rate 92 bpm. Initial treatment included oxygen 28% FiO2 via a venturi mask and fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations on auscultation of chest and a swollen and tender right leg. Initial investigations revealed deranged biochemical markers () and opacification affecting the right midzone of the lung ().\nInitial laboratory workup summarised in .\nIn view of the clinical presentation and raised d-dimer, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed which reported right upper lobe consolidation with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification in the left upper lobe and both lower lobes, suggestive of early COVID-19 infection (). Moreover, his troponin I levels were markedly elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in the anterolateral chest leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function with an akinetic and rounded apical septal wall.\nOn account of the history, examination, and investigations, he was treated as suspected COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score = 2, moderate severity), COVID-19 myocarditis, and sepsis, leading to multiorgan failure. In view of poor physiological reserve and comorbidities, the ceiling of care was decided to be ward level care and noninvasive ventilation if needed. However, he began to improve clinically, became normotensive, and was able to be weaned off oxygen day 3 after admission. By that time, his swab detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nFollowing initial improvement, he suddenly developed a new, increased oxygen demand, requiring titration of humidified oxygen up to 10 litres. Chest physiotherapy helped him bring up copious volumes of thick sputum, and he was stable for most of the day with oxygen saturations of 93%. Later that day, he suddenly deteriorated and becoming cyanotic and critically unwell. Oxygen saturations were 80% on 15 litres nonrebreathe mask, and he was significantly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute. An urgent portable chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax causing mediastinal shift ().\nAn intercostal drain was inserted on an emergency basis and the patient improved slightly over the next 24 hours though he still required oxygen via a high flow nasal cannula system to maintain oxygen saturations of 92% or more. Despite the chest drain and the addition of thoracic suction, the lung did not reexpand. He continued to deteriorate rapidly, was unable to tolerate further pleural procedures, and died. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are reported to be present and so three points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 3 = 3. Pulmonary Embolism is not reported to be the #1 diagnosis and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3. The patient's heart rate is 92.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and so the score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 115.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 11.1 count/L. To convert 11.1 count/L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0 L/m^3 which will give 11.1 white blood cell count/L * 1000.0 L/m^3 = 11100.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 1.

The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 34.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 34.5 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 34.5 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 34.5 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 34.5 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 34.5 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 34.5 mEq/L) = 6.5 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.5 mEq/L. Plugging in 6.5 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 6.5 - 12 = -5.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -5.5 mEq/L.",

His past medical history was significant for spastic partial quadriplegia (C5-C7, incomplete) secondary to trauma six years prior, neurogenic bladder with suprapubic catheter placement five years prior, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), depression, and chronic constipation. He complained of pain and could localize it in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with no radiation to any other part of the abdomen. He described the pain as constant, burning in nature, and 8 out of 10 in severity. The pain was associated with fever, chills, and nausea. On query, he denied hematuria, urostomy site discharge, flank pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or bloody stools. The patient had been afflicted by multiple UTIs in the last six months, the causal organisms for which included the Morganella species, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Escherichia coli. His symptoms during this admission were consistent with those of his previous infections. Surgical history included two herniated cervical disc repairs and suprapubic catheter placement. He was not allergic to any drug in particular. His domiciliary medications included baclofen, gabapentin, docusate sodium, glycerin suppository, mirtazapine, and sertraline. He did not report any significant medical diseases running in his family. He did not report any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. His ambulation was restricted, necessitating bed confinement and the use of a wheelchair due to paraplegia and spastic deforming contractures. On physical exam, his blood pressure was 124/74, he had a pulse rate of 77, and his oral body temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit. His body mass index was 17.63 kg/m. The remainder of his physical examination was significant for lower extremity contractures. There was no abdominal tenderness and rigidity.\nInitial lab work revealed a hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dl, a white blood count of 11.39 Th/uL, and a platelet count of 286 Th/uL. A basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed a sodium at 143 meq/L, potassium at 4.4 meq/L, chloride at 108 meq/L, bicarbonate at 27 meq/L, BUN at 17 mg/dl, and creatinine at 0.7 mg/dl. Blood sugars were at 97 mg/dl. Urinalysis with microscopy revealed purple urine, leukocytes at 21 40/HPF, RBCs at 15 cells/HPF, leukocyte esterase positive, and nitrates positive. Urine was alkalotic with a pH of 8.5 and a specific gravity of 1.010. Empirically intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated on a daily basis.\nThe patient’s catheter tubing and bag contained bright purple urine with small amounts of pale colored sediment. Figures - demonstrate purple-colored urine in the urine bag and catheter tubing, respectively. The patient denied any episodes of purple urine in the past. A urine culture grew Proteus vulgaris resistant to Cefazolin and sensitive to other cephalosporins, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP­ /SMX), and piperacillin/tazobactam. He was started empirically on ceftriaxone that was continued after culture results, and the following day clear yellow urine had accumulated in his urine bag. The blood cultures remained negative, and his leukocytosis resolved. After being given four doses of intravenous ceftriaxone and a discernible improvement in symptoms, he was discharged from the hospital on a three-day course of TMP /SMX to complete the prescribed seven-day course of antibiotics.\nInformed patient consent was obtained for treatment of this patient. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "282.587",
    "Upper Limit": "312.333",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 143.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mEq. To convert from 143.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 143.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 143.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 143.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 143.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 17.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 97.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 143.0 + (17.0 / 2.8) + (17.0 / 18) = 297.46 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 297.46 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> The proband is a boy and he is the only child born from a 36 year old father and a 27 year old mother. The parents were healthy and unrelated; paternal family history was negative for genetic diseases, while in the maternal family, eight members were affected by retinitis pigmentosa with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Prenatal ultrasonographic evaluation gave normal results in fetal growth and morphology. No prenatal invasive genetic test was performed.\nThe child was born by natural delivery after a 40 week gestation plus 5 days. Birth weight was 3420 g (25°- 50° centile for gestational age), length at birth was 52 cm, (between 50°- 75° centile), occipito-frontal circumference (OCF) was 35.5 cm (50°- 75° centile), APGAR score was 9/10. In neonatal period, the child presented hyperpyrexia (blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid microbiological analyses were all negative) and greater than 10% weight loss, which regressed with adequate nutrition. Episodes of bronchospasm and tirage, repeated episodes of cyanosis and desaturation resolved spontaneously shortly before discharge (at one month of age). During childhood his height growth was at the lower limit. He did not show any major malformation, besides submucous cleft palate. Brain MRI scan did not show any structural anomalies.\nHe had mild myopia and his hearing was normal. He did not show any significant medical complications.\nAt the age of 12 years and 1 month his weight was 41.6 kg (25°-50° percentile), his height was 134.2 cm (<3° percentile) and his OFC was 53 cm (50° percentile). His Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23 (75°-90° percentile). Facial dysmorphic features included long face, high nasal bridge, short and smooth philtrum, micrognathia. He had small hands and nasal speech.\nEndocrinological analysis (IGF-1 dosage and growth hormone stimulation test with arginine) showed results consistent with isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency. A further brain MRI scan, carried out when he was twelve, revealed a small pituitary gland. GH treatment has been advised and the patient has just started this therapy.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\nAt birth, karyotype on peripheral blood lymphocytes was requested because of mild hypotonia and minor dysmorphic features.\nConventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an interstitial deletion on chromosome 11 from bands 11q13.5 to 11q21 (Figure A). The parents’ karyotypes were both normal and the analysis was extended to 100 metaphases to rule out 11q deletion mosaicism. At the age of twelve, a comparative genomic hybridization array (Array-CGH) was performed using a CGH + SNP 4 × 180 K microarray kit (Agilent Technologies). The microarray contained 110,172 probes with a median probe spacing of 25.3 Kb (5 KB in International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium, ISCA) and 59,647 SNP (UCSC hg19, ). Array-CGH was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies) and allowed the identification of a more distal deletion of 17,2 Mb in size: from 11q14.3 to 11q22.3 (from nt 92,434,272 to nt 109,584,301)(555 probes with median Log2ratio value of −1.04). In the same region, 337 SNP probes showed a single allele (Figure B,C). No additional pathogenetic Copy Number Variations (CNVs) were detected. The molecular karyotype, defined following the International System of Chromosome Nomenclature 2013, was: arr 11q14.3q22.3(92,434,272-109,584,301)x1.\nAt 1 month of age, the proband’s neurological examination showed no major dysfunctions; clinical observation according to Prechtl´s Method on the Qualitative Assessment of General Movements [] showed a pattern characterized by Poor Repertoire. His motor milestones were not significantly delayed: control of the head at 4 months, sitting without support at 8 months, hands and knees crawling at 11 months, standing with assistance at 13 months, walking alone at 24 months.\nParents reported vocalization, babbling and the first word “mamma” being uttered at one year of age. “Mamma” remained the only word used to name everything word until 19 months of age. After a period of hospitalization following an accidental fall which caused clavicle fracture and a second spell in hospital due to gastroenteritis, the child presented an arrest in speech and psychomotor competencies. These aspects were inscribed in a global regression of communicational and relational capacities.\nSpeech development between 20 and 36 months was characterized by: aphonia, amimia, pseudo- articulatory movements, reduced opening of the labial rima. Moreover, the child showed a poor communicative intent even at a non verbal level.\nAt 3 years he was a clumsy, passive and withdrawn child, not interested in playing. Therefore, at 3 years of age a psychomotor treatment with attention to relational aspects was introduced twice a week.\nDuring the first year of rehabilitation, the proband reduced his more passive traits becoming more and more purposeful, actively responsive and assertive. Communicative intention emerged together with the increasing awareness of his speech difficulties.\nThere was a large discrepancy between the verbal comprehension (discrete) and expressive skills: he used gestures associated with vocalization to indicate, to formulate questions, to express disappointment or excitement. Then, speech therapy sessions began twice a week at the age of 4.\nThe proband showed a deficit of phonetic and non-phonetic phonation. Later, rhinolalia and rhinophonia, and a deficit in coordination and in phonological memory were observed. Consequently, a double diagnosis of specific expressive language disorder and of childhood apraxia of speech was formulated.\nAt 5 years, after one year of speech therapy, he achieved a quite complete phonetic repertoire, vocabulary increase with risk threshold for semantic errors, and emerging narrative skills. While he showed an adequate lexical comprehension, morphosyntactic comprehension was delayed of one year and communication was supported by mimics and gestures. At the same time, he developed social skills, showing more relational and playing capacities with peers and adults.\nAt age 6, verbal speech was sufficiently intelligible despite the persistence of hypotonic and uncoordinated glosso-velo-pharyngeal muscles.\nHis cognitive development, as measured by WIPPSI Scale, was in the lower limits of the normal range, with a discrepancy between verbal (VIQ) and performance (PIQ) scores (VIQ =85; PIQ =96; Full Scale IQ = 89) [].\nAt the age of 8, the proband presented an impairment in the ability of naming objects and in lexical retrieval with the help of phonemic cues. On using the Italian version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [], comprehension was almost adequate (Language quotient = 82).\nMorphosyntactic comprehension using the Rustioni Metz test [] showed a delay of about 2 years. The verbal short term memory span was 3 (inadequate).\nMoreover, learning difficulties in the presence of a cognitive development at the lower limit of the normal range emerged. In particular, reading comprehension, measured using the MT battery of tests [], was inadequate (correct answers: 6/10), in the absence of dyslexia and dysorthography, as measured with the Dyslexia and Orthographic coding test []. Therefore, the logopedic rehabilitation continued until the child was 9 years old, with the aim to improve oral and written language comprehension. In the meantime, his writing and reading abilities supported him in planning the phonological string in speech.\nAfterwards, counselling to parents and teachers, together with neuropsychiatric follow up continued until today with longitudinal controls (twelve years). We considered highly important to support parents and teachers in finding a harmonious global development which could take into account not only the educational aspects, but also the emotional and relational sides.\nWe were able to observe a global improvement in cognitive abilities (as illustrated in Figure D, where WISC III at 9 and 11 years of age are compared) [].\nCurrently the child shows good skills at school in the application of the learned mechanisms, but he has more difficulties when logic skills and problem solving abilities are required. However, he is able to evaluate his work and adopt compensatory strategies in order to overcome his difficulties. He is competitive with his schoolmates, comparing their tests results and scores. He shows a good personal and social independence and participates in curricular and extracurricular activities with peers. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

Abdominal examination revealed that the abdominal region was leveled and soft without any pressure or pain, and no palpable masses or superficial lymph nodes were observed. Hematological tests showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.8 g/dL, indicating anemia, and no abnormalities were indicated by CEA, CA19-9, and AFP tumor markers were observed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like mass with delle and bridging fold in the greater curvature of the lower stomach, and the tumor was suspected as the cause of anemia (Fig. ). Ultrasound endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT) (with the fourth layer as the main locus) and a tumor (with the third layer as the main locus), with some areas of indistinct borders (Fig. b). Tissue biopsy of this tumor indicated group 5 tubular adenocarcinoma, and thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor with a mottled contrast stain in the stomach body and no regional lymph nodes or distant metastases (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with collision tumor of gastric cancer and SMT (GIST was highly suspected). Gastrectomy was performed via laparotomy, and the surgical findings were a diagnosis of H0P0CY0 according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Distal gastrectomy was performed with D2 lymph node dissection according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines [].\nThe tumor was located in the greater curvature of the antrum of the stomach and measured 50 × 45 mm in size (Fig. a). On the cut surface, a nodular tumor was mainly observed in the submucosal layer, and the mucosal surface was ulcerated (Fig. b). A large part of the tumor was observed to be mixed and some of the cancer parts and GIST alone sites were observed. (Fig. c). The nodular tumor was characterized by the intermingled proliferation of carcinoma cells and spindle cells (Fig. d). The spindle cells formed a nodular tumor in the submucosal layer and the subserosal layer. Carcinoma cells invaded the nodular tumor of the spindle cells. Pathological examination revealed Ki67 positive cells comprised 2% of the GIST. The average mitotic count was ≤ 5 mitotic figures per 50 high power fields. GIST was classified as very low risk according to the guidelines for GIST risk stratification []. Tubular adenocarcinoma had reached the subserosa, and no lymph node metastases were observed. The pathological findings were a diagnosis of pT3N0M0 pStageIIA, according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a positive reaction for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) in the carcinoma cells (Fig. a). Further, the nuclei of adenocarcinoma cells were positive for TP53 (Fig. b). Although the spindle cells were negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and TP53, these cells were positive for c-kit (Fig. c), weakly positive for DOG-1, and negative for desmin and S-100. As a result, the tumor was diagnosed as a collision tumor of GIST and adenocarcinoma. Lymph node metastasis of GIST or adenocarcinoma was not observed, and the resected margins were negative for neoplastic cells. Histologically, the intratumoral GIST sections contained different KIT exon 17 mutations, and KIT exon 17 mutation corresponding to amino acid substitution Asp820Lys was observed. On the other hand, the adenocarcinoma section detected no KIT mutation.\nNo complications were observed postoperatively, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 14.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 101.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 101.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 101.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 101.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 101.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 101.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 32.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 32.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 32.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 32.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 32.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 32.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (101.0 mEq/L + 32.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 7.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 7.0 - 12 = -5.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -5.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -5.0 mEq/L / -8.0 mEq/L = 0.625. The patient's delta ratio is 0.625.",

He had a fever one week prior admission that relieved with sacetaminophen, and no other complaints were reported. He had no contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. He has history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. He previously consumed aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, diltiazem, atorvastatin and subcutaneous insulin.\nHis blood pressure (BP) was 132/75 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 79 beats per minutes (bpm) regular, and respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation of 85% (free air) that improved to 95% with a non-rebreathing oxygen mask (NRM) 15 Liters per minute. His physical examination showed no increased jugular venous pressure, bilateral lung crackles, pleural friction rub, and leg edema.\nComprehensive evaluations were performed, including ECG, COVID-19 antigen swab, laboratory examination, and chest radiography. His initial ECG showed normal sinus rhythm of 79 bpm, left axis deviation, with inferior OMI. Laboratory data showed increased CRP (195.3 mg/L), hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), respiratory failure, and respiratory acidosis. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pneumonia. COVID-19 antigen swab was positive. Thus patient and family were consent for isolation and tracing procedure. As his blood gas showed respiratory failure with severe ARDS (\nPaO\n2/\nFiO\n2 82 mmHg), we planned on invasive ventilation, however the procedure was postponed due to unavailability of ventilator machine and intensive care unit overload.\nHe was then started on antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin, antiviral therapy with remdesivir, dexamethasone, continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) multivitamins and his daily medication (insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, beta-blockers, nitrates, and atorvastatin). Tocilizumab 400 mg was also given on the second day of admission and continued for 5 days. His vital signs and laboratory examinations were routinely monitored.\nDuring the sixth day of admission, his oxygen saturation deteriorated. He was then put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with slightly better oxygen saturation (92-94%). His symptoms showed gradual improvement in several days. His laboratory examination on the tenth day showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), increased D-Dimer. No prolonged hemostatic values were found. Plasma prothrombin time (PPT) was 20 sec, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 38.6 sec.\nOn the ninth day of admission, the patient reported gross hematuria, at that time he was still on unfractionated heparin therapy within targeted APTT. Laboratory data showed significantly reduced thrombocytes (40,000 mg/L). Urine examination showed gross hematuria with leukocyturia (10–15 cells/field), nitrituria, and proteinuria (2+). The patient underwent ECG and chest radiography evaluation, which showed no significant changes (\n).\nHeparin was thought to be the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient. Since heparin antibody was not routinely checked in the developing country, we choose HIT’s scoring system as an alternative. The scoring system shows 4Ts of 6 and HEP Scoring system of 5 (\n). Both 4Ts and HEP scoring indicate a high-risk probability for HIT, hence the anticoagulant was switched to rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily. The symptoms were then improved with the absence of hematuria after 2 days. The thrombocyte evaluation showed normalization to 177,000 on the eleventh day.

Because the age is between 65 and 74, one point added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.

Initially, he noticed a small 4 × 4 cm swelling below the left clavicular region, which rapidly increased in size to about 10 × 10 cm in 4 months. He complained of breathlessness on climbing a normal flight of stairs. He also had a dragging sensation in the chest and hoarseness of voice since last 2 months. There was no history of preceding trauma. On enquiry, the patient gave history of sexual promiscuity in the form of multiple unprotected heterosexual intercourses with multiple partners prior to his marriage in his early twenties. The patient also gave history of painless ulcer on coronal penis with painless inguinal swelling about 20 years back following exposure for which he did not seek any medical advice. Inguinal swelling was treated by incision and drainage by a local doctor. The patient denied any history of skin rash on his body. There was no history of any neurological problem. His personal history revealed alcohol abuse and smoking.\nLocal examination showed a large well-defined pulsatile swelling on the left side of the anterior chest wall measuring about 10 × 10 cm externally []. Palpation confirmed a pulsatile swelling with bruit in some areas associated with auscultatory thrill. His general and systemic examinations including neurological examination were within normal limits. His height and weight were 156 cm and 42 kg, respectively. Cutaneous, genital, and mucosal examinations were negative for any syphilitic stigma except for the scar in the right inguinal region which corroborated with the past history of an inguinal bubo. His hemogram revealed a low hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl with a normal white blood cell count of 5600/mm3. Serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase [AST] 22 U/l, alanine transaminase [ALT] 13 U/l) including serum lipid levels and urinalysis was within a normal range. His blood serology was positive for syphilis (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test [VDRL] 1:32 and Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay [TPHA] 1:2560) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); however, serology for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. The VDRL of the cerebrospinal fluid was nonreactive. Ophthalmic examination did not show any signs of papilledema. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. His blood pressure was 180/70 mm of Hg in right upper and lower extremity. Chest roentgenogram showed widening of the mediastinum and a mass in the left upper and mid-zone with a marginal right shift of the trachea []. Computed tomography (CT)–angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm of the ascending and arch of aorta of an approximate size of 8 cm penetrating through the chest wall in the left parasternal region and peripheral thrombus of 4 cm with a bony erosion of the sternum and first three ribs on the left side; however, origins of coronary arteries were spared. A three-dimensional reconstruction image of the coronal view of cardiac angiography showed aneurysm of the ascending and arch of aorta along with arch vessels []. Abdominal sonogram showed a mild degree of hepatomegaly which was consistent with the carrier stage of serum hepatitis. Two-dimensional echocardiography of the heart showed the following findings: left atrium 2.8 cm; aortic annulus 1.9 cm; left ventricular internal dimension 2.8 cm (systole); left ventricular internal dimension 3.9 cm (diastole); left ventricular septum 1.1 cm; left ventricular posterior wall 1.1 cm; ejection fraction 60%, and mild aortic regurgitation with aneurysm mainly involving the ascending and arch of aorta.\nThe patient was immediately admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery division for definitive management. Penicillin treatment given for syphilis can lead to thrombotic complications (due to the local antigen release); hence, the prophylactic course of oral steroids in the form of prednisolone 20 mg daily was advised. After a week of oral steroids; the patient was given injectable benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once a week for three consecutive weeks after intradermal sensitivity testing. The steroid cover was continued for a period of 6 weeks with a slow taper following penicillin therapy. Aneurysm was replaced with a synthetic albumin-coated Dacron graft under cardiopulmonary bypass using the technique of hypothermic circulatory arrest at 20–22°C/68°F. Cerebral circulation was maintained through the antegrade flow via right carotid artery cannulation. However, the patient continued to bleed through the chest tube during the postoperative period and was found to have disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to hypothermia and multiple blood transfusions (D-dimer levels were raised). Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to death on the first postoperative day. Histopathology of the postmortem diseased aortic segment showed changes suggestive of syphilitic pathology on special stain for elastin in which elastic fibers were found to be degenerated and fragmented []. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Past history was significant for repeated episodes of muscle weakness. At that time, she was diagnosed to have hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and started on oral potassium supplementation. Her physical examination was normal except for subtrochanteric fractures of bilateral femora. There was no muscle weakness of both upper limbs. The power in the lower limbs could not be tested due to fractures of both femora. On investigation, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl, BUN 26 mg/dl, S. Na+ - 133 mmol/L, S.K+ 2.7 mmol/L, S. Ca++ 9.7 mg/dl, S.phosphorus 2.1 mg/dl, uric acid 2 mg/dl, S.bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, SGOT 42 U/L, SGPT 23 U/L, S.albumin 3.2 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase 837 mg/dl. Her Vitamin D3 was 10 ng/ml and S.PTH 38.5 pg/ml. Her thyroid function tests were normal. Analysis of arterial blood gases (ABGs) (on room air) revealed pH of 7.22, PaO2 of 61, PCO2 of 23, HCO3 of 11.3 with base deficit of - 17 mmol/L, Na+ - 139 meq/L, K+ 2.3 mmol/L, Ca++ 0.41 mmol/L, Cl − - 122 mmol/L, and an anion gap of 8 meq/L. The urinary pH was 7.5. On radiological evaluation, there was an acute pathological subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, old subtrochanteric fracture of the right femur and left proximal fibula. On ultrasound abdomen, there was dystrophic parenchymal calcification in the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side. Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta acetic acid revealed nonfunctioning left kidney with the normally functioning right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal except for frequent ventricular ectopics. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. A bone scan showed avid uptake of tracer in right sixth rib, left seventh rib, bilateral proximal femora, left proximal fibula, shaft of the right humerus, and renal cortex [].\nBased on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed to have RTA (distal or type 1, normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis) with hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic bone disease. Surgery was deferred in order to optimize the condition of the patient. The goal of therapy was to maintain serum pH of >7.3 and S.K+ >3 mmol/L. She was started on potassium supplementation intravenously (IV), followed by oral potassium 21 meq tid, tablet alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg, oral sodium bicarbonate 1 g (11.9 mmol) thrice a day, and oral calcium 500 mg BD. After 4 days, ABG analysis showed pH 7.307, PaO296 mmHg, PCO225 mm Hg, HCO312.3 mmol/L with base deficit of - 12.6 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, and Ca++ 0.92 mmol/L. She was posted for interlocking nailing of fracture of left femur to be followed by right femur after 2 days.\nOn the day of surgery, she was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 h prior to shifting to the operation theatre (OT). In the OT, standard monitors were attached and wide bore IV access was secured. Radial arterial cannulation was done for continuous blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis. Under strict aseptic precautions, epidural space was located in sitting position at L3-4 intervertebral space through a median approach by the loss of resistance to air with an 18G Tuohy needle. A subarachnoid block was established with the administration of 3 ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine with 25 μg of fentanyl via 27G spinal needle (needle through needle technique). A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h. For postoperative analgesia, a bolus of 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine (after a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine without epinephrine) was given epidurally and an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was started at 6 ml/h. The operation on the contralateral femur was done under epidural anesthesia 2 days later. Postoperatively, ECG was continuously monitored and ABG analysis was done twice a day for 3 days. Oral bicarbonate and potassium supplements were continued and additional IV supplementation was given as required.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 122.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 122.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 122.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 122.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 122.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 122.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.3 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 11.3 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.3 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 11.3 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (122.0 mEq/L + 11.3 mEq/L) = -0.3 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -0.3 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 3.2 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. Let's first convert the mass of albumin from mg to g. The mass of albumin is 3.2 mg. To convert 3.2 mg of albumin to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.2 mg albumin * 0.001 g/mg = 0.003 g albumin. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.2 mg albumin/dL converts to 0.003 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -0.3 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.003 (in g/dL)) = 9.692 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 9.692 mEq/L. Plugging in 9.692 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 9.692 - 12 = -2.31 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -2.31 mEq/L. Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -2.31 mEq/L / 12.7 mEq/L = -0.182.

The patient's lung was ventilated through both lumens of the tube, with tracheal cuff inflated, but a resistance at manual ventilation was felt immediately after intubation. Chest auscultation revealed bilaterally equal and diminished breath sounds with pulse oximetry saturation decreasing from 99% to 96%. DLT was removed and before a second left endobronchial intubation attempt, examination of the DLT showed no carinal hook (Figure ). An 8.0 mm ID single-lumen endotracheal tube was placed and then fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. An increased in pulse oximetry saturation (from 95% to 99%) with normal chest auscultation was noted.

    "problem": "<Context> A 47-month-old female\nVoiding difficulty and urinary incontinence\nThe patient was born fullterm with a birth weight of 2.4 kg. At the age of 2 weeks, she was diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease and underwent the Duhamel operation. At that time, a ganglion cell was noted at the proximal sigmoid. After the operation, she was able to evacuate the bowels well until 6 months of age and she stopped visiting the outpatient clinic. She has a history of constipation of over 1 year. Constipation had been managed with oral lactulose and enema using glycerin at a nearby hospital over 1 year when she complained abdominal pain, agitation and holding her stools with 3- or 4-day interval. After enema, sausage-shaped stools were frequently observed. Her mother could not remember the exact characters of stool. There was no abnormal and unusual feeding history or urinary pattern before admission.\nThe patient was transferred to our hospital due to acute urinary obstruction. One week ago, diffuse lower abdominal pain developed which was managed at a local clinic with medicine for constipation. However, abdominal pain persisted. One day before admission, abdominal distension and voiding difficulty developed.\nOn initial evaluation the patient had a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a pulse rate of 96 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a body temperature of 36.5℃ with a body weight of 14.5 kg (the 50-75 percentile) and a height 99.9 cm (>the 97 percentile). She was irritable because she could not pass urine despite the feeling of micturition. Her abdomen was distended, and focal tenderness was present at the lower quadrant. Auscultation revealed lower than normal bowel sounds. The location of the anal orifice on the perineal area and anal tone were both physiologic. No abnormal dimple or skin lesion on her sacral area was observed and her neurologic examination was physiologic and normal. Fecal materials were palpable on digital rectal examination.\nAbundant fecal materials were observed on abdominal X-ray (), and ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen revealed a distended bladder with a thin bladder wall and both hydronephrosis of grade III (). Hematological examinations and blood chemistries were as follows: a hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, a total white cell count of 5.9×109/L, a platelet count of 357×109/L and granulocyte and lymphocyte levels of 41.5% and 46.1%, respectively; A serum calcium level of 9.7 mg/dL (8.6-10.2), a magnesium level of 1.2 mg/dL (1.5-2.3), a sodium level of 144.1 mmol/L (135-145), a potassium level of 3.6 mmol/L (3.3-5.1) and a chloride level of 104.6 mmol/L (98-110). Her blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hepatic transaminase and C-reactive protein levels were normal. Urinalysis collected via a catheter was normal. Thyroid function test was not checked. Sigmoidoscopy could not be performed to her because of a large amount of feces in her distal colon despite repeated glycerin enema and digital evacuation.\nAfter urinary catheterization, 720 mL of urine was drained and abdominal pain and distension was improved. However, urinary obstruction persisted and urinary catheterization was kept continuously. On day 3 after admission, voiding difficulty persisted despite loose stool passage after repeated glycerine enema. For ruled out the abdominal mass, whole-abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed and showed a large fecaloma in the sigmoid colon and a displaced bladder (). The coronal image of the CT showed that the distal part of the colon was markedly dilated and contained heterogeneous materials consisting of impacted feces. The markedly dilated distal colon was suspected as Duhamel pouch. The bladder neck was displaced into the upper abdomen because of the large fecaloma-filled pouch. After repeated glycerin enemas and digital evacuations, spontaneous urination was noted on day 5. USG revealed a normal sized bladder and improved both hydronephrosis. However, she could not evacuate bowels sufficiently by herself. We could palpate a membranous tissue in her rectum at the time of digital evacuation. On day 7, a colon study revealed a giant Duhamel pouch filled with fecal materials without a definitive the membranous tissue in her rectum (). We decided to perform an operation because she had a giant Duhamel pouch, an unidentified membranous tissue and to perform a full-thickness rectal biopsy. Two weeks later, operation was done after sufficient evacuation of the feces in her rectum. A septum was noted in Duhamel pouch, which ran transverse direction in her rectum on the operative findings. Post-Duhamel septum revision was performed. Histopathologic findings of the full-thickness rectal biopsies showed a ganglion cell in the rectum. Since the operation, she has been visiting our outpatient clinic regularly. She has been free of defecation and urination difficulties without the need for medicine. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> A 74-year-old female patient (height: 157 cm, weight: 56.8 kg) was diagnosed with degenerative osteoarthritis and admitted for bilateral total knee replacement arthroplasty. The patient was also previously diagnosed with angina and hypertension 2 years earlier and placed on drug treatment (isosorbide-5-mininitrate and atenolol). Blood and biochemistry tests performed prior to surgery were within normal ranges. Similarly, on simple chest radiograph, no special findings were observed except cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio = 0.57). Sinus bradycardia, first degree atrioventricular block, and T wave inversion in leads V2-3 were detected on electrocardiogram, and the ejection fraction by cardiac ultrasonography indicated a normal reading of 60%.\nTo perform surgery under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia, 9 mg 0.5% high density bupivacaine (Marcaine®, Astrazeneca, Sweden) was injected into the subarachnoid space, and an epidural catheter was inserted through which a test dose of 3 ml 0.375% levobupivacaine (Chirocaine®, Abbott, Norway) containing epinephrine diluted to 1 : 200,000 was injected. Surgery began after confirming that sensation was blocked to the 10th thoracic segment. During surgery, 5 L/min 100% oxygen was administered via face mask. Vital signs of patient were stable throughout the entire surgery. Pulse oxygen saturation was maintained at 100%, and arterial blood gas analysis performed every 50 minutes was also within normal ranges. Operation time was 3 hours and 5 minutes, and the total anesthesia period was 4 hours and 25 minutes. Estimated blood loss was approximately 1,100 ml, and urine volume was approximately 850 ml. During surgery, 500 ml 6% hydroxyethyl starch (Hextend®, Bio time, USA), 3,000 ml Hartmann solution, and 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBC) were administered. After surgery was completed, the patient was transported to a recovery room, and 6 L/min 100% oxygen was supplied via face mask. After confirming that sensation was recovered up to the 11th thoracic nerve segment, pain was controlled by administering 5 ml/h 0.1% levobupivacaine and fentanyl (1.5 µg/ml) through the epidural catheter. In the recovery room, the patient showed stable vital signs, and arterial blood gas analysis was within normal ranges. The patient was transported to a ward with 100% oxygen supply of 2 L/min via nasal cannula.\nImmediately after transporting the patient to a ward, pulse oxygen saturation level was observed to be 90%. Thus, 5 L/min 100% oxygen was administered via face mask until pulse oxygen saturation level was again within normal ranges. Suddenly, nine hours after surgery, the patient exhibited a drowsy mental state during which she could not respond to calling. The patient was only able to open her eyes and respond to pain. Blood pressure and heart rate were within normal range, respiratory rate was 20 times/min, and pulse oxygen saturation level was 90%. Thus, the rate of 100% oxygen supplied via face mask was raised to 7 L/min, and simple chest radiography and brain computed tomography (brain CT) were performed. Simple chest radiography revealed bilateral pulmonary effusion, but no abnormal findings were observed by brain CT. Afterward, patient symptoms were persistent, so, on the next day, brain magnetic resonance imaging (brain MRI) and 3D pulmonary arteriography were performed to rule out pulmonary embolism. Several bilateral small high signal intensity lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices were detected on diffusion MRI. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the area was reduced, suggesting fat embolism (). On 3D pulmonary arteriography, no special findings were detected.\nUpon referral to the neurology department, the patient was transferred to the stroke unit the day after surgery. Immediately after transfer, her breathing became shallow and irregular and pulse oxygen saturation level decreased to 84%. She also exhibited eyeball deviation to the left side and nystagmus. The patient was unresponsive to even strong stimulation, and the conscious state was stuporous. The patient was intubated because, while being supplied with 7 L/min 100% oxygen via face mask, pulse oxygen saturation level decreased to 58% and blood pressure decreased to 70/40 mmHg. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and placed on a mechanical ventilator. Blood pressure was measured at 95/60 and, at that time, a fever of 38℃ was observed. After arriving on the intensive care unit, the neurology department considered administering low molecular weight heparin. Nonetheless, blood tests performed at that time revealed that hemoglobin was 8.3 g/dl and platelets had decreased to 34,000/µl. In a blood coagulation test, an increase in coagulation time was indicated; therefore the drug could not be administered. Packed RBCs and platelets were transfused, and inotropics as well as diuretics were administered. Three days after surgery, ischemic colitis was observed, and a petechial rash developed all over the entire body, including the abdomen.\nFour days after surgery, blood coagulation test results were normal, so administration of low molecular weight heparin was initiated. However, the conscious state of patient was still stuporous, and neurological symptoms were unimproved. Five days after surgery, an electroencephalogram was performed from which moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction was found.\nSeven days after surgery, due to improved conscious state and arterial blood gas analysis, the patient was weaned off the mechanical ventilator. Thirteen days after surgery, the endotracheal tube was removed, and respiratory and neurological symptoms were improved. Seventeen days after surgery, the patient was transferred to a general ward. Twenty six days after surgery, brain MRI revealed that multiple brain infarctions had become normal, and the patient was discharged 44 days after surgery. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 21.2 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 145.0 mg/dL.

During an evaluation for headaches, an MRI revealed an aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery (LICA) in the supraclinoid territory. There was no history of previous CVA or SAH. The morning of surgery, the patient's BP was 134/51 mmHg and the HR was 71 beats/minute. The patient had not taken his routine antihypertensive medications the morning of surgery. The treatment plan was for coiling of LICA aneurysm in the interventional radiology suite under general anesthesia. Preoperatively, an 18 gauge IV cannula and premedication provided by intravenous midazolam (2 mg). An arterial cannula was placed in the right radial arterial. The patient was transported to the interventional radiology suite and positioned to comfort. Standard ASA monitors were applied and the patient was pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen. Anesthesia was induced with lidocaine (100 mg), fentanyl (100 μg), and propofol (total dose of 80 mg). Neuromuscular blockade was provided by vecuronium (10 mg). Immediately after endotracheal intubation, the BP was 105/70 mmHg with a HR of 60 beats/minute. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (expired concentration 4-6%) and 100 mg of fentanyl.

    "problem": "<Context> The case was a 42-year-old male patient who had suffered of acute-on-chronic liver failure because of hepatitis B virus-associated liver cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease. This patient was referred to our center for LT. SI totalis was identified at the pretransplant computed tomography scan (), but detailed studies on vascular anatomy were not done because of severe renal dysfunction. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 41 at admission, so he was enrolled in the waiting list with Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) old status 2A, which provided priority allocation. His height and body weight were 178 cm and 95 kg, respectively.\nConsidering the recipient status of SI, we waited for a deceased donor with a small body size. After eight days of waiting, a whole-liver graft of a 69-year-old female donor was allocated for this patient. Her height and body weight were 159 cm and 58 kg, respectively. The donor-recipient body weight ratio was 0.61. The graft weight was 1360 g, so the graft-recipient body weight ratio was 1.43. After laparotomy, the recipient’s native liver was removed according to the standard procedures of deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT). We performed veno-venous bypass using a centrifugal biopump with inflow from the portal vein and left iliac vein. At this stage, the whole-liver graft was temporarily placed within the upper abdominal cavity to assess its proper location and orientation. Since the upper abdominal cavity was large enough to accommodate the whole-liver graft in the orthodox position, we decided to perform a large cavocaval anastomosis using a modified piggyback technique (). After clamping of the suprahepatic and retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), the orifices of the right, middle and left hepatic vein trunks were opened altogether to make a large single orifice. In addition, we made a 5-cm-long longitudinal incision at the ventral surface of the retrohepatic IVC to enlarge the anastomotic vein orifice further. The corners of the recipient and graft IVC orifices were tagged with 4-0 Prolene sutures, and then a 4-cm-long longitudinal incision was also made at the dorsal surface of the graft IVC. These triangular-shaped orifices at the recipient and graft IVCs were matched and sutured with 4-0 Prolene. Thereafter, we packed a large bulk of surgical gauzes at the left subphrenic space to support the liver graft. The portal vein was anastomosed under this orientation with gauze packing. We performed hepatic artery reconstruction using branch patches and duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis with insertion of a rubber T-tube (). In order to maintain the orientation of the outflow and inflow vessels of the liver graft in the designed position, we placed a large tissue expander at the left subphrenic space for mechanical support of the liver graft.\nThe graft function was recovered uneventfully with no surgical complications (), but hospitalization was prolonged because of poor general condition and pneumonia. The water within the tissue expander was gradually removed, and the expander was removed at 46 days after transplantation. This patient was finally discharged 63 days after the DDLT.\nAt 30 months after DDLT, the liver function deteriorated progressively (). Initial liver biopsies suggested acute cellular rejection. Subsequent repeated liver biopsies revealed severe cholestasis, mild portal inflammation with bile duct atrophy and loss, and perisinusoidal fibrosis, strongly suggesting chronic rejection. At 34 months after first DDLT, his liver function deteriorated with MELD score of 28 and KONOS old status 2B. After some waiting period, he was finally allocated for whole-liver graft for retransplantation. The donor was a 43-year-old male with height of 174 cm and body weight of 73 kg. The graft weighed 1760 g, and the recipient’s body weight was 83 kg at that time, thus GRWR was 2.12. After laparotomy, the recipient’s first liver graft was removed according to the standard procedures of DDLT. We also performed veno-venous bypass using a centrifugal biopump. When the second whole-liver graft was temporarily placed within the upper abdominal cavity, we found that the right upper abdominal cavity was too small to accommodate the whole-liver graft in the orthodox position. Since the spleen was definitely enlarged, we performed splenectomy to make room to accommodate the bulky right liver of the whole-liver graft. The surgical techniques used for the first DDLT were used again in the second DDLT operation, including large cavocaval anastomosis using a modified piggyback technique, end-to-end portal vein and hepatic artery reconstruction, and duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction. A tissue expander was not necessary in this operation because the left subphrenic space was already shrunken. The recovery of the graft function was delayed because of the extrinsic compression of the liver graft, although there were no surgical complications (). Hospitalization was very prolonged because of very poor general condition and repeated lung problems. This patient was finally discharged 254 days after the second DDLT.\nDuring follow-up at the outpatient clinic, renal function deteriorated progressively, and hemodialysis started at 5 years after the second DDLT. After hemodialysis for 8 months, he underwent living-donor kidney transplantation from his wife.

Neonatal and infancy periods were uneventful; nevertheless his motor development was delayed as he did not sit independently until the age of 15 months or walk unaided until the age of 22 months.\nAt the age of 5, language delay was observed and laboratory investigation was performed, including audiogram, biochemical and thyroid tests, which proved normal. He received speech therapy for a two-year period and his language difficulties resolved. He attended mainstream primary school with extra educational support and finished this level at the age of 12 years. At the age of 13 years he was referred for full developmental assessment because he was experiencing severe learning difficulties in secondary school. Upon physical examination, he was characterized as quite a sociable child, with mild dysmorphic facial features such as almond shaped eyes, hypertelorism, anteverted nostrils, and gothic palate. His weight at the time was 49 kg (40th percentile), height 160 cm (60th percentile) and HC 54 cm (25th percentile). Upon neurological examination, he showed mild motor delay with severe clumsiness but without focal neurological signs. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Heart auscultation revealed a mild systolic murmur.\nUpon developmental evaluation, he was found to function at the mental level of a 10-year old.

His serology for HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C was negative. He had a history of blood transfusion (6 units) in June 2005 in his native country. His post-operative period was uneventful. He was inducted with a single dose of basiliximab on the day of transplantation and his immunosuppressants were prednisolone 15 mg, Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)–500 mg B.D, cyclosporin 175/150 microemulsion on discharge while returning to his country. The patient developed new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). On discharge (6/10/2005) his blood urea was 31 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL.\nHe returned to Tanzania and was followed-up there. He came back for a review 1 year later when his investigations showed urea 36 mg/dL, creatinine 1.2 mg/dL. Three months later, he presented with a rapidly progressive ulcerative lesion on his right thigh associated with swelling of the right lower limb. The ulceroproliferative lesion was 20 × 15 cm with skin discoloration and bilateral palpable inguinal lymph nodes. Investigations showed urea 53 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, sodium 133.4 mEq/L, potassium 4.09 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 23.2 mEq/L. Wedge biopsy of the skin lesion showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and inguinal lymph node biopsy suggesting features consistent with Kaposi sarcoma []. Repeated testing of HIV was negative and staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative Epstein-Barr virus IgG 22.6 and IgM 8.5. He was started on chemotherapy (liposomal doxorubicin). MMF was stopped, and cyclosporin and prednisolone were tapered with the plan of stopping in 2-3 weeks. He was started on sirolimus 5 mg once a day. On discharge, his investigations were urea 44 mg/dL, creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, sodium 124.6 mEq/L, potassium 5.03 mEq/L, chloride 96 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18.6 mEq/L, Hb 8.4 gm/dL, and TWBC 7500 cells/mm3. He received three doses of chemotherapy.\nOn follow-up, his Kaposi sarcoma lesion had regressed. His blood urea was 37 mg/dL and creatinine 1.3 mg/dL. He was given one dose of liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg on 15/3/2007. His right leg venous Doppler was normal. He was discharged with sirolimus monotherapy. His follow-up on 8/12/2007 was uneventful with blood urea 42 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/ dL, and he was continued on the same line of treatment.\nOn 20/05/2011, he presented with hematuria and high-grade fever. He had diarrhea for 3 days without blood or mucus. Stool analysis was unremarkable and the diarrhea settled. His investigations were blood urea 91 mg/dL, creatinine –3.1 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 25.8 mEq/L, c alcium 9.2 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL.

She had been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and was put on medical treatment.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except a soft (grade II/VI) continuous murmur that was heard most clearly over the pulmonary area. An electrocardiogram was normal without any evidence of ischemia, and echocardiogram showed mild dilatation of the left atrium and left ventricle. Coronary angiography demonstrated multiple coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistulae originating from the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA). There were no flow-limiting lesions in the coronary arteries. There was TIMI III flow in coronary vessels distal to the origin of the fistulae [Figures and ]. After a thorough discussion during the weekly catheterization meeting, it was decided to close the fistulae surgically in order to alleviate symptoms. Issues that prompted against transcatheter intervention were acute angle of origin of the fistula arising from LAD and the excessive tortuosity that would make transcatheter coil embolization of the coronary fistula extremely cumbersome and complex. Intra-operatively, the coronary fistulae were confirmed to be originating from the RCA and the LAD and terminating into pulmonary artery with an intervening “fistula lake.” The “lake” next to the LAD was identified, and the vessels feeding this lake were occluded with surgical clips as were the vessels coming from RCA. The aneurysmal sac was further obliterated using a larger surgical clip. Post-operative coronary angiogram showed no evidence of residual fistulae [Figures and ].

The patient developed nonbloody, large-volume diarrhea after eating take-out 11 days ago, with four to five bowel movements per day. During this time, she also experienced fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and weakness. In addition, she observed leaking and drainage around her G-tube site with associated erythema and intense abdominal pain. The patient denied sick contacts or recent travel.\nHer past medical history includes obesity, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, gastrojejunal ulcer, Kawasaki’s disease, subdural hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic pain syndrome, and anxiety. The patient’s past surgical history includes burr-hole craniotomy, lithotripsy, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by chronic refractory marginal ulceration and small bowel obstruction requiring two resections, ventral hernia repair, and gastrostomy tube insertion.\nThe patient was pregnant six times and had six miscarriages (G6P0060). She lives with her husband and adopted son with good social support. She is currently unemployed. The patient denies ever smoking and does not drink alcohol. Familial history consists of diabetes, heart disease, and nephrolithiasis in the patient’s mother. Her father had glaucoma, nephrolithiasis, and prostate cancer.\nMedications before admission included pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, sucralfate 1 g twice a day, ondansetron 4 mg twice a day as needed for nausea, midodrine 10 mg three times a day, fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice a day, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, levetiracetam 1500 twice a day, methadone 10 mg every 8 hours, and lorazepam 0.5 mg daily as needed for anxiety. She was also on daily vitamin A, D3, and B-complex supplements and a monthly cyanocobalamin 1000 μg intramuscular injection, in addition to a nutritional supplement Isosource 1.5 Cal that is administered through the G-tube once every night.\nDue to her complex past surgical history, the patient was sent from her local emergency department to our hospital. At presentation, the patient was febrile to 101 ℉. Blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with erythema and purulent drainage around the G-tube site on the left upper quadrant. The general examination showed a thin patient who is alert and oriented. Mucous membranes were moist. Lungs were clear to auscultation as she was breathing comfortably on room air. Heart sounds were regular without murmurs. Extremities were warm with intact pulses bilaterally and no edema. However, she had moderate muscle loss for her age. Skin was intact except for the previously mentioned erythema around the G-tube. Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II–VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.\nSerum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 × 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 × 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.\nA fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 ℉, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient’s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).\nFollowing completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later. At the time of discharge, her hemoglobin remained stable at 11.2 g/dL, and she was able to tolerate an oral diet. She continues to follow up with her bariatric surgeon in clinic with no recurrence of fever or diarrhea. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-0.853",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.771",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 111.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 20.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 20.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 20.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 20.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 20.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 20.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (111.0 mEq/L + 20.0 mEq/L) = 5.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 5.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 5.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.5 (in g/dL)) = 8.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 8.75 mEq/L. Plugging in 8.75 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 8.75 - 12 = -3.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -3.25 mEq/L. Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -3.25 mEq/L / 4.0 mEq/L = -0.812. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is -0.812.",

On transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), a 25 × 40 mm mobile pedunculated mass continuous with the right ventricular heart muscle was detected in the right atrium and the patient was admitted to our department for close examination and treatment. At admission, his height was 162.0 cm, body weight was 61.1 kg, body temperature was 36.3 °C, pulse was 62 beats/min, blood pressure was 112/59 mmHg, and SpO2 was 100% (room air). Pulmonary sounds were clear with no crackles, and heart sounds were regular with no murmur. Leg edema was present.\nPlain chest radiography revealed a cardiothoracic ratio of 49% with no cardiac dilation. Electrocardiography revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 71 beats/min with nonspecific ST-T segment changes. Blood chemistry revealed the following: white blood cell (WBC) count of 51.9 × 104/μL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 14.9 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 16.3 × 104/μL, creatine kinase (CK) of 81 U/L, creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) of 8 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 161 U/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.10 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 0.7 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 1.2 ng/mL, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen of 1.2 ng/mL, and soluble IL-2 receptor: 633 U/mL. Inflammatory parameters were within the normal range and the soluble IL-2 receptor level was slightly elevated, but the levels of other tumor markers were within their normal ranges. A coronary computed tomography (CT) scan showed no significant stenosis. It was deemed very difficult to completely excise, so we decided on partial tumor resection with MICS to reduce the risk of tumor embolism and to obtain an accurate pathology diagnosis. Therefore, we did not perform CAG. If we had performed a CAG, we may have seen arteries feeding the tumor.\nTTE showed a 40 × 30-mm mobile pedunculated tumor in the right atrium that was continuous with the right ventricular heart muscle (Fig. ). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed a solid septated tumor with an irregular surface invading the free wall of the right atrium and surrounding the annulus of the anterior cusp and right and left coronary cusps of the aortic valve (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced CT showed invasion based on soft tissue intensity near the tricuspid valve above the anterior right ventricle in the region between the aorta and pulmonary artery and around the pulmonary artery (Fig. , ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thickened anterior wall near the tricuspid valve and a mass protruding into the lumen and expanding into the region between the aorta and the pulmonary artery (Fig. , ); in addition to the patient’s advanced age, these features made it difficult to perform extended cardiac surgery. On fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG-PET), there was abnormal accumulation in the right atrium surrounding the aortic root (Fig. ).\nSurgery was performed to prevent tumor embolism-induced sudden death and to obtain a pathological diagnosis. Anticoagulation was not performed preoperatively because it was unlikely that the tumor was a thrombus. A double-lumen tube was inserted during surgery and a Swan-Ganz catheter and 14-Fr cannula were inserted through the right internal jugular vein after draping. In a supine position with 30° elevation of the right side, a 4-cm skin incision was made in the fourth intercostal region at the medial aspect of the nipple. Meanwhile, the femoral artery (FA) and femoral vein (FV) were exposed. A pericardiotomy was performed 2 cm anterior to the phrenic nerve and the pericardium was elevated. After systemic heparinization, an 18-Fr blood supply tube was inserted through the right FA, and a 25-Fr cannula was inserted through the right FV to establish a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The superior vena cava was blocked with a bulldog clamp and the heart rate was controlled at 40–50 bpm with a β-blocker. An oblique incision was made in the right atrium with the heart beating, and the lumen was observed. The tumor adhered to the anterior surface of the right atrium but not to the annular region and had marked mobility. The tumor was grasped with an Endocatch and the pedicle of 1-cm width was transected using electric cautery (Fig. ). The lack of any residual right atrial tumor or shunt was confirmed and the right atrium was closed in a double suture pattern; the patient was then weaned from CPB. The pericardium was closed as far as possible, the wound was closed by the standard method, and surgery was completed. The operative time was 1 h 56 min, and the duration of CPB was 38 min (Additional file ).\nIntraoperative macroscopic findings revealed a tumor with a smooth, greyish-white surface (Fig. ). A blackish-brown region suggestive of hemorrhage was present inside and on pathological examination (Fig. ), a diffuse proliferation of round cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio were observed on hematoxylin and eosin staining. The tumor cells were mainly medium- and small-sized cells that contained nuclei with a shallow cut that were the same size or slightly smaller than the nuclei of vascular endothelial cells; large cells were also present. Broken nuclear products and histiocytes phagocytosing these products were also observed. Upon immunohistological staining, the tumor cells were CD79α-positive and CD3-negative. B-cell-derived cells were overwhelmingly predominant, which suggested that the lesion was a B-cell-derived tumor. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) immunostaining was negative. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\nExtubation was performed 6 h after surgery and the patient was transferred to a general ward 2 days after surgery. The disappearance of the tumor from the annular region was confirmed on TTE 5 days after surgery and the patient was discharged when he was able to independently walk 6 days after surgery. After observation at an outpatient clinic, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy was initiated 37 days after surgery. After 8 cycles were administered in total, an FDG-PET scan performed 456 days after surgery showed no abnormal accumulation (Fig. ), indicating CR. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

The patient described the pain as gradual in onset, which progressively worsened over two days duration. The pain was dull in quality, radiated to her right shoulder, worsened with meals, taking a deep breath, and moving. She described the severity of pain as 8/10; it was associated with nausea and vomiting of ingested matter for the past three days. She denied any alleviating factors. Furthermore, the patient complained of dry cough and gradual worsening of shortness of breath which started seven days ago. Shortness of breath was both at rest and while walking. The patient also had intermittent low-grade fever with a T-max of 100.8°F in the past three days. Otherwise, she denied chest pain, leg swelling, hemoptysis, yellowish discoloration of the eye, change in stool color, diarrhea, or constipation.\nUpon initial evaluation and physical exam, the patient was fully awake and oriented to person, place, and time. Initial vitals were as follows: respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 86% on room air which later improved to 94% with 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, blood pressure of 127/87 mmHg, pulse rate of 89 bpm, and temperature of 98.6°F. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) exam revealed pink conjunctiva and nonicteric sclera, dry tongue, and buccal mucosa. On respiratory system exam, she had mild tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min and bilateral coarse crackles with rhonchi. Heart sounds were irregularly irregular, S1 and S2 well heard no murmur or gallop. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) was flat, and no distended neck veins. The abdomen was slightly distended abdomen which moved with respiration. The patient had marked right upper quadrant tenderness on both superficial and deep palpation with significant guarding and rigidity, and murphy’s sign was positive. She had no costovertebral angle tenderness or suprapubic tenderness. Extremity exam revealed mild pretibial and pedal trace edema. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5,800 k/uL, hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, platelet of 170,000 k/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 398 pg/mL,aspartate transaminase (AST) of 21 u/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 14 u/L, alkaline phosphatase 62 u/L, and total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL. Inflammatory markers were elevated with C-reactive protein (CRP) of 68 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 278 u/L, and D-dimer of 0.77 mg/L FEU (fibrinogen equivalent units)​​​​​​. ​Procalcitonin was within normal limits (0.20 ug/L). Blood cultures showed no growth in two bottles. COVID-19 nasal swab test was positive. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates typical of viral interstitial pneumonia (Figure ). Ultrasound of the gallbladder showed gallbladder wall thickness with mild pericholecystic fluid collection and no gallstone suggestive of acalculous acute cholecystitis (Figures , ). The most recent echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%.\nThe patient was admitted to the COVID-19 unit with the diagnosis of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia and acute acalculous cholecystitis. She was treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and vitamin supplements. The patient also received supportive care with oxygenation via nasal cannula. Anticoagulation with Eliquis from her home medication was continued for the atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Empiric antibiotic coverage was initiated for acalculous cholecystitis with Zosyn after evaluation by the general surgeon. The patient was kept on nothing by mouth, and cholecystectomy was postponed as the patient clinically improved with empiric antibiotic coverage. The patient completed a 5-day course of remdesivir as an inpatient and eventually weaned off oxygen. Abdominal pain was significantly resolved, and oral feeding was resumed on the third day of her admission. Eventually, she was discharged home with oral Augmentin and the remaining dose of dexamethasone as well as vitamin supplements. She was given a follow-up appointment with general surgery as an outpatient for elective cholecystectomy after six weeks. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

    "Upper Limit": "5",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 76 years old. Because the age is greater than 74, two points added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2. The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4. The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 5. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 5.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 38-year-old woman with a childhood history of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis came to our outpatient clinic because of polyarthralgia and swelling of her fingers. Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever (). Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall. She had no rash except for a malar erythema that was faint at that time. All her fingers were swollen, but her wrist, shoulder, and knee joints were not. Both her legs had pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory data showed mild hypoproteinemia (serum protein 6.4 g/dL) and slightly decreased peripheral white blood cell count (4,100/μL). However, other hematologic parameters were relatively normal (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, reticulocyte 1.4%, and platelet count 230,000/μL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Regardless of hypocomplementemia (C3 72 mg/dL, C4 9 mg/dL, and CH50 18.6 U/mL), the tests for serum antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Althoughthe IgG antibody was not examined, a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody (index 7.97) indicated a recent infection of the virus []. Since microbiological tests for other viruses, such as measles and rubella, were negative, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was finally made. Because her symptoms deteriorated despite the use of acetaminophen, oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was alternatively started immediately after the diagnosis (). The symptoms, including facial erythema, polyarthralgia, and the swelling of her fingers, rapidly disappeared within 12 hours after the initiation of the drug. No recurrence of the symptoms or signs was noted afterwards, indicating the complete remission of the disease. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "problem": "<Context> A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Nephrology, Kansai Electric Power Hospital on January 14, 2014, for proteinuria. He had been followed up for hypertension and dyslipidemia in a local clinic since the age of 50. He had experienced several vascular events, such as total occlusion in the common iliac artery at the age of 63 and two histories of cerebral infarction at the ages of 70 and 77. He had 30 years of smoking history but no alcohol habit. He had no family history of kidney disease except for one cousin showing end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology. During his initial admission to our hospital, his urine protein level was 5.4 g/g Cr, and serum albumin was 3.2 g/dL; he was discharged because his condition was stable. Ten months later, edema of his lower limbs worsened, and renal biopsy was performed on his second admission.\nOn the second hospitalization, physical examination showed the following: height of 169 cm, weight of 70 kg, body mass index of 24.5, and blood pressure of 180/88 mmHg. Laboratory findings revealed a nephrotic range of urine protein, 9.15 g/g Cr accompanying microscopic hematuria of dysmorphic 10 – 19 RBC/HPF, and total serum protein and albumin of 4.8 and 1.8 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine was 0.95 mg/dL, AST was 29 IU/L, ALT was 14 IU/L, and ALP was 188 IU/L. Serological examination revealed serum IgG, IgA, and IgM of 875, 344, and 52 mg/dL, respectively. Antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.\nLipid analysis revealed elevated total cholesterol (259 mg/dL), triglyceride (376 mg/dL), and LDL cholesterol (167 mg/dL) levels, and a low HDL cholesterol level (45 mg/dL). The serum ApoE level was 13.6 mg/dL (normal range: 2.8 – 4.6 mg/dL). An oral glucose tolerance test showed no abnormality, and his hemoglobin A1c was 5.7%. Although hypertriglyceridemia was marked, systemic abnormalities characteristic of hyperlipidemia, such as corneal opacities, xanthoma, and Achilles tendon hypertrophy, were not found. Moreover, the patient had no family history of hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus.\nLight microscopy (LM) revealed that the specimens contained 27 glomeruli, 8 of which showed global sclerosis (29.6%). Most glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis, infiltration of foam cells containing lipid deposits in capillary lumen (a). In periodic methenamine silver (PAM)-stained sections, spike formation and bubbling were detected on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (c, d). Mild to severe arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were also seen. Fibrosis was observed in ~ 20% of the whole interstitial area. Intriguingly, Sudan III staining was strongly positive not only in the mesangial and infiltrating foam cells but also in the focal capillary lumen in the glomerulus (b). Immunofluorescence (IF) studies demonstrated subtle granular staining for IgG along the capillary wall; however, C3 was not detected (data not shown). Electron microscopic (EM) findings analysis showed electron-dense deposits (EDDs) with a variety of densities and distributions. Highly-dense deposits accompanied by spike formation identical to MN were seen in the subepithelial area (a, b). In the subendothelial area, highly dense EDDs were detected but in higher magnification, and microbubbles were contained (a, b). Effacement of foot process was also accompanied with these depositions. In addition, EM findings demonstrated that the capillary lumina was filled with lipid deposits that did not show lamellar formation similar to “lipid thrombi” in LPG.\nPlasma ApoE phenotypes were analyzed by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis as previously reported [, ]. The patient’s sample showed the position of ApoE2/2 (a, Lane 1).\nThe APOE genotype was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis as described previously [, ]. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme HhaI. Genotype ε2/2 in the patient was identified by 91- and 83-bp fragments (b, Lane 1). The ApoE Toyonaka (Ser197Cys) as shown in d was also confirmed by RFLP analysis digested with SacI (c). Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers, sense 5′-CGTGCGGGCCGCCACTGTGAGCT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCGCATGGCTGCAGGCTTCGGCGTTC-3′. The 335-bp fragment after cleavage by SacI suggested normal c.644C of ApoE in codon 197 (Lane 3). The 358- and 335-bp fragments after cleavage by SacI showed a heterozygous novel mutation of ApoE Toyonaka (Lane 2). Direct sequencing of APOE DNA was performed as described previously []. Based on the results, we identified a homozygous polymorphism at codon 158 (e2/2: c.526 C>T: Arg158Cys) (data not shown) and a heterozygous missense mutation (C to G) in exon 4 leading to an amino acid substitution Cys (TGC) for Ser (TCC) at codon 197 (c.644 C>G: p.S215C: Ser197Cys) (d). All these findings were the same as that of a previous case of ApoE2/2 and ApoE Toyonaka showing MN-like glomerular histology [6].\nFor hypertriglyceridemia, fibrate 400 mg/day was started. Obtaining the results of the IF and EM studies, which did not deny immune-related MN like lesions, PSL 10 mg/day and cyclosporine (CyA) 75 mg/day for NS were started. These treatments brought about a substantial improvement of hypertriglyceridemia and complete remission of NS by 300 days after admission. During maintenance therapy with oral PSL 5 mg and CyA 75 mg/day, he had cerebral infarction and aspiration pneumonia. After withdrawal of CyA, his NS relapsed with an increase of proteinuria more than 1 g/day. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Postoperatively, S-I (a novel oral compound of tegafur, gimestat, and otastat potassium at a ratio of 1:0.4:1 that is aimed at the biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil, was administered at a dose of 40 mg. Since peritoneal dissemination was progressive, irinotecan hydrochloride was then administered at a dose of 80 mg every two weeks from February 2005. In May 2005, tumor dissemination showed progression, and tumor marker levels also increased. Abdominal CT scanning revealed ascites and disseminated peritoneal metastases (). Therefore, he was hospitalized for treatment.\nOn admission, the patient was 165.5 cm tall and weighed 53.0 kg. His conjunctivae were slightly pale. An abdominal tumor was palpable to the right of the umbilicus and intestinal peristalsis was slightly increased.\nThe laboratory findings on admission were as follows: a white blood cell count of 5.3 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 18.6 × 104, total protein of 5.8 g/dL, AST of 10 IU/L, ALT of 2 IU/L, T-Bil of 0.38 mg/dL, urea nitrogen of 29.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 6.49 mg/dL, CEA of 27.8 ng/mL, and CA19-9 of 633.0 U/mL.\nThe patient was treated with reference to the modified FOLFOX6 protocol (mFOLFOX6).10 L-OHP (40 mg/m2 for a total dose of 63 mg) and 1-LV (200 mg/m2: a total dose of 314 mg) were administered simultaneously over 120 min via the side and the main tubes of a Y-tube, respectively. Then 5-fluorouraci (5-FU) (400 mg/m2: a total dose of 628 mg) was administered rapidly via the side tube, followed by 5-FU (2,000 mg/m2: a total dose of 3,140 mg) via the main tube over 46 hours. The dose of L-OHP was set at 40 mg/m,2 because its area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) was reported to increase two-fold when the creatinine clearance was 60 mL/min or less . Hemodialysis was performed 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), and was started 30 min after completing the administration of L-OHP. The free platinum level in plasma ultrafiltrate was measured immediately after the administration of L-OHP, at 15 min afterward, before hemodialysis, immediately after starting hemodialysis, at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after starting hemodialysis, and after the completion of hemodialysis. To measure the platinum level after administration of L-OHP, blood samples were collected from the dialyzer before and after each hemodialysis session to examine platinum clearance by hemodialysis. Each blood sample was centrifuged immediately after collection, and 1 mL of plasma was subjected to ultrafiltration using an Amicon® filter with a molecular cut-off of 30,000 Da. Then assay of platinum was performed as reported by Gilmour et al. .\nHemodialysis was performed for 3 hours at a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min using a TR-2001N dialysis membrane and a BG-1.8U dialyzer (Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the administration of L-OHP and measurement of blood drug levels. Adverse reactions were classified according to Commom Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 .\nTo avoid accumulation of L-OHP, it was scheduled to be administered at 3–week intervals. Administration was done on schedule during the second course, but the third course was delayed by 1 week. As adverse events, the neuropathy did not appear in all courses.(Grade 0) and anorexia (Grade 2) and fatigue (Grade 2) developed at 1 week after administration of L-OHP during the first course of therapy. During the second course, anorexia (Grade 3), constipation (Grade 2), and fatigue (Grade 3) occurred, leading to delay of the third course. There was no tumor regression (). On September 26, the patient died due to progression of his cancer. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

She was treated with spironolactone (100 mg/day), magnesium lactate (1.2 g/day), potassium chloride (5.4 g/day) and indometacin (25 mg/day).\nThe patient was recently admitted to our Nephrology Department with oliguria and progressive facial and lower limb oedema 15 days in duration. Her blood analyses showed urea 60 mg/dL, creatinine 0.93 mg/dL, Na 138 mmol/L, K 3.3 mmol/L, Cl 98 mmol/L, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, Ca 8.2 mg/dL (ionic 1.08), P 3.1 mg/dL, total proteins 4.5 g/dL, albumin 1.7 g/dL, bicarbonate 30.1 mmol/L, cholesterol 441 mg/dL, triglycerides 151 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 101 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 339 mg/dL.

    "Lower Limit": "0.327",
    "Upper Limit": "0.361",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 30.1 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 30.1 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 30.1 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 30.1 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 30.1 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 30.1 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 30.1 mEq/L) = 9.9 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 9.9 mEq/L. Plugging in 9.9 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 9.9 - 12 = -2.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -2.1 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -2.1 mEq/L / -6.100000000000001 mEq/L = 0.344. The patient's delta ratio is 0.344.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 46-year-old man who served as a government official first visited our hospital with complaints of 8-month history of involuntary movements during sleep time, and 3- month history of slow response and walking unsteady. He had begun feeling depressed without a known cause 8 months ago. At almost the same time, he had started to engage in involuntary movement such as kicks and grasps during nighttime sleep, with snoring and sleep apnea. He took diazepam tablets, but it did not work. Afterwards, he noticed excessive sweating and felt hot and cold waves. His maximum body temperature was 37.2°C; after he used nimesulide, the temperature dropped to 35.0°C and was subsequently increased, with difficulty. Moreover, he got terrible constipation at that point. He visited mental health centers and was diagnosed with “mild depression” without auxiliary examinations or treatment 4 months ago. About 3 months ago, his family noticed that he had lost approximately 20 kg in weight, choked when drinking, and exhibited slow response, visual hallucinations, and walking unsteady. He got frequent drops from bed during sleeping due to his substantial actions; meanwhile, gasping breath and sleep apnea fragmented his sleep. Eventually, he spoke seldom and seemed to be blunt with shuffling gait.\nThe patient did not have any relevant medical history. He denied having history of trauma, prior blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, and alcohol abuse (Table ).\nThe patient was the fourth individual in his large family to exhibit the same clinical manifestations. The other 3 members all died within a year after onset (Fig. , pedigree chart).\nEight months after the onset, he was taken to our hospital by his families. We did series of tests at that time.\nThe middle-aged man appeared dull. During check-up, he fell into “sleep” easily and soon was awakened in horror by his involuntary sleep movements or snoring. The skin and general examination were normal. Temperature: 36.5°C, respiratory rate 20/min, Blood pressure (lying): 165/109, Pulse: 115. Blood pressure (standing): 150/100 mm Hg, Pulse: 110. Weight: 77 kg. Height: 178 cm.\nHe exhibited severe cognitive impairments, particularly with respect to orientation, attention, calculation power, delayed memory, and visuospatial dysfunction (his Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 15/30 and 9/30, respectively).\nHe had slurred speech and dysarthria\nCranial nerves (CNs) I-VIII and XI-XII revealed no deficits. CN IX and X showed slowness of bilateral gag reflex, and limited symmetrical elevation of soft palate to phonation.\nMuscle tone was normal. Muscle strength was 5/5 for all groups tested. Spontaneous and evoked myoclonus was evident.\nBilateral biceps reflex and bilateral triceps reflex were 3/4, and bilateral patellar reflex and bilateral Achilles reflex were 4/4. Hoffman sign and Babinski sign were absent. Frontal lobe signs palmomental and grasp were not elicited.\nTouch, pin, vibratory, and proprioception sensations were normal. Romberg test was negative.\nCoordination was inaccurate for finger/nose testing and heel/knee/shin testing; rapid alternating movements were clumsy.\nArm swing was absent. There was bradykinesia and postural instability. Rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia (dysarthria and gait instability), and myoclonus were typical signs in prion diseases.\nTemperature monitoring revealed that the patient's body temperature fluctuated from 36.0°C to 37.8°C, and the loss of circadian rhythm was observed. Blood pressure monitoring indicated a steady high blood pressure of approximately 150/100 mm Hg and the loss of dipper-type blood pressure rhythm, with a heart rate that fluctuated approximately 100 beats per minute. A dynamic electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with the incidental discovery of multifocal ventricular premature beat.\nBlood examinations such as blood routine, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, myocardial enzyme, blood ammonia, homocysteine, folic acid, VitB12, microelement (calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, lead, thallium, zinc), thyroid function and antibodies, rheumatism biomarker, infection-related antibodies (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV), and tumor marker showed normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (intracranial pressure was 200 mmH2O, cell number 1, glucose, chloride, protein, acetic acid, IgA, IgM, IgG, Oligoclonal bands, PCR for JC virus, EB virus, HSV-I virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) appeared normal and 14–3–3 protein was negative. Autoimmune encephalopathy related antibodies (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, contactin-associated protein 2, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 1 receptor, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 2 receptor, leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1, gamma-aminobutyric acid B), and paraneoplastic syndrome related antibodies (CV2/CRMP5, PNMA2, RI, Yo, Hu, Amphiphysin) in blood and CSF were all detected, but none of them indicates abnormity. Routine urinalysis and fecal analysis were normal. Hormone secretion detection demonstrated the abnormal secrete rhythmicity of prolactin and growth hormone.\nExtensive θ activity and scattered slow waves are recorded in an electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the frontal and temporal. Polysomnogram (PSG) demonstrated the patient's obvious deprivation of total sleep time; neither spindle nor slow wave sleep was detected during his “fragmented sleep,” even when he showed snoring, mentalis relaxation, sleep apnea, and hyoxemia (Fig. ).\nThe nucleotides from 12742 to 13318 (GenBank accessionnumber U2918) of exon I in PRNP were amplified; then, polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. The results were analyzed using DNA Sequencing Analysis Software version 3.4.1 (Gene Codes Corp, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Genetic analysis found that the patient harbored a D178N/129M haplotype mutation in PRNP (a GAC→AAC homozygous mutation at codon 178 and a methionine polymorphism at codon 129).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with FFI and received treatment with drugs to improve brain metabolism, such as idebenone, ganglioside, and coenzyme Q10. During the follow-up by telephone, his wife told us that he got once improvement in his responsiveness soon after discharge; however, sudden death occurred 3 months later. The total disease course was 11 months.\nThe patient information involved in our manuscript has been obtained and informed consent was obtained from his legal representatives.

He had experienced similar pain a month earlier, 2 h after his evening meal. Blood examination, chest radiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), and computed tomography (CT) showed no specific abnormalities, and he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. A 12-lead ECG at our facility showed T-wave inversion in leads V1 through V3. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe hypokinesis from the antero-septal wall to the mid-apex. He was admitted to our hospital to undergo CAG for suspected myocardial ischemia. The patient had a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, sudden deafness, and smoking. He had no history of dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or alcohol consumption, and there was no history of ischemic heart disease in his family. Although he was diagnosed with IgG4-RD 1 year prior, he had not received any treatment for that condition. At that time, pathological examination of a submaxillary gland showed an infiltration of small lymphocytes, acidophilic leukocytes (acidocytes), and plasma cells, particularly IgG4+ plasma cells. The IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cell ratio was >40%. Four months previously, he had also been diagnosed with IgG4-related nephritis on the basis of a renal biopsy.\nHis physical examination showed a blood pressure of 138/74 mmHg, a pulse of 48 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. No cardiac murmurs or abnormal respiratory sounds in the lungs were detected with auscultation. Blood examination revealed elevated levels of creatinine (1.12 mg/dL; normal: 0.65–1.09 mg/dL), triglycerides (163 mg/dL; normal: 35–150 mg/dL), and brain natriuretic peptide (53.4 pg/mL; normal: 0.0–18.4 pg/mL), and a normal level of β2 (1.9 mg/dL; normal: 0.8–2.0 mg/dL). Immunological examination showed elevated levels of IgG (1896 mg/dL; normal: 739–1649 mg/dL), IgG4 (527 mg/dL; normal: 4–108 mg/dL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R; 751 U/mL; normal: 220–530 U/mL) and low levels of C3 (82 mg/dL; normal: 86–160 mg/dL) and IgM (29 mg/dL; normal: 46–260 mg/dL).\nCAG showed a 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery (). The stenosis looked smoother than those seen in arteriosclerotic stenosis. No other lesions were detected. After a guide wire crossed the lesion, IVUS (View It; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) catheter was inserted to visualize the characteristics of the LAD lesions. IVUS demonstrated a thickened black layer beneath the intima at the lesion and nearly normal vessel wall at the proximal and distal LAD (). Compared to proximal and distal arteries, stenosis of the lesion consisted of thickened intima-media, especially black layer beneath the intima. The LAD lesion was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a drug-eluting stent. PCI was successful with no complications, and the patient’s exertional chest pain resolved after treatment. Two months later, the patient was started on corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of sudden deafness.

Physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally and mild generalized edema in his lower extremities. The patient had oliguria (~170 mL over 24 hours). Outside medical records indicated that he was diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis (testing methodology not stated) 2 weeks before admission and was prescribed penicillin.

An arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following values: pH 7.29, pO2 58 mm Hg, pCO2 43 mm Hg (). Creatinine was 1.78 mg/dL with a blood urea nitrogen level of 52 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and hematuria with multiple dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine sediment. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibodies were elevated at 1270 IU/mL, suggesting recent infection with group A streptococcus. C3 (9 mg/dL) and C4 (8.9 mg/dL) were also measured.\nA chest X-ray () noted bilateral airspace consolidation. An outside chest computed tomography scan showed diffuse centralized alveolar densities in both lungs suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage. Due to hemoptysis, a bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed a bloody lavage and erythematous mucosa in the main stem bronchi and subsegments. The bronchoalveolar lavage consisted predominantly of neutrophils with a few mononuclear cells. The culture had no growth. The patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day) and plasmapheresis.\nThe patient’s renal function worsened in the first 3 days and was restored after 4 sessions of plasmapheresis during the first week (). The ASO levels showed progressive decline with each session of serum exchange (). Immunoassays including antinuclear antibody, anti–double stranded DNA, antiphospholipid, antiglomerular basement, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Infectious process was ruled out by testing including chest X-ray, urinalysis, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures. The patient was in critical condition, and in the setting of the patient’s rapid improvement with the treatment, the likelihood of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) was high. Therefore, lung and kidney biopsies were not performed as the risks outweighed the benefits at the time. Given the patient’s history of pharyngitis, clinical presentation, laboratory analyses, and response to immunosuppressive regimen, he was diagnosed with PRS secondary to streptococcal pharyngitis.\nThe patient’s pulmonary function gradually improved, and he was extubated on day 8. His edema cleared and the majority of his laboratory findings normalized by 11 days postadmission. He noted poor adherence to penicillin treatment after streptococcal pharyngitis.

Proteinuria (1+) had been first identified during a medical checkup 3 years prior and was ignored until increasing to 3+ in 2011. Her parents and brothers suffered from dyslipidemia but had no history of renal disease.\nOn admission, her height and weight were 161 cm and 49 kg, respectively, and her blood pressure was 137/94 mm Hg. On physical examination, slight pitting edema was observed; however, there were no xanthomas. Urinary protein excretion was 4.12 g/g Cre, and the serum triglyceride level was high. She did not exhibit nephrotic syndrome. The other laboratory findings are shown in Table . A computed tomography scan showed neither atrophy nor enlargement of the kidneys.\nA renal biopsy specimen was processed in August 2011 using standard methods, and in the sections for light microscopy, the renal cortex was found to contain 11 glomeruli, 2 of which showed sclerosis. The remaining glomeruli were enlarged by distinct dilatation of the capillary lumina, which were filled with thrombus-like substances that stained slightly with periodic acid-Schiff. Some glomeruli exhibited moderate mesangial cell proliferation and increased mesangial matrix, and double contours of the capillary wall were partially observed. No crescents or adhesion in glomeruli were found (Fig. –c). A direct immunofluorescence showed no deposition of IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, C3, or fibrinogen in glomeruli. Staining with Oil red O showed lipid droplets in the capillary lumina, which were stained positive for apoE (Fig. , e). Electron microscopic findings showed capillary dilation and occlusion with numerous lamellated lipid granules. Thin basement membranes with swollen endothelial cells were also observed. The histological findings and the results of apoE analysis (described below) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for LPG [].\nTreatment with fenofibrate and irbesartan was initiated.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 34-year-old Japanese man, whose family history included a father with hypertension, and a mother that suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but which did not include either a consanguineous marriage or any incidence of renal cysts. At the age of 31, the patient presented with mild albuminuria, and a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 2.98 mg/dL. At the age of 34, the patient was admitted to hospital with a creatinine level of 8.2 mg/dL.\nUpon admission, the patient's height, weight, and blood pressure were 179 cm, 58 kg, and 126/80 mm Hg, respectively. The patient exhibited anemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL), azotemia (Cr 8.38 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism; thus, he was diagnosed with ESRD. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed that, although the size of both kidneys appeared to be normal, the patient's renal parenchyma showed increased brightness. We performed a percutaneous renal biopsy; histologically, six of 16 glomeruli displayed global sclerosis, along with mild cellular infiltration, conspicuous interstitial fibrosis, renal tubular atrophy, and cystoid irregular dilation (Figure ), suggesting an NPHP diagnosis. We performed targeted sequencing using a next-generation sequencer, with the approval by the research ethics committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the patient's written informed consent. A homozygous full gene deletion of NPHP1 (NM_000272.3:g110879716-110962709) was resultantly identified, as well as heterozygous substitutions in PKD1 (NM_0001009944.2:c.6395T>G(p.Phe2132Cys)) (Figure ), BBS1 (NM_024649.4:c.908T>C(p.Val303Ala)), and INPP5E (NM_019892.4:c.1652C>T(p.Thr551Met)). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 34 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 8.2 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 179.0 cm, which is 179.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.79 m. The patient's weight is 58.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 58.0 kg / (1.79 m * 1.79 m) = 18.102 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.1, indicating they are underweight. Because the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 58.0 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 34) * 58.0 * 1) / (8.2 * 72) = 10.413 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 10.413 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and weight loss of 8 kg over the previous two months. The patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 57 kg. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse was 110 beats/min. She was on no diuretics or other medications. She did not have a medical history or diarrhea upon presentation. On admission, she had weakness in both limbs (Medical Research Council Grade 2), but her deep-tendon reflexes were intact. Babinski’s sign and ankle clonus were absent.\nUpon initial laboratory analysis, her sodium was 142.8 mEq/L; potassium, 2.3 mEq/L; chloride, 125.5 mEq/L; calcium, 7.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; magnesium, 2.6 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 17.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and albumin, 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, suggesting renal loss. Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO2 of 67.8 mmHg, HCO3 of 7.6 mEq/L, SpO2 of 90.2%, and a serum anion gap of 9.7, suggesting normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1.\nDue to the patient’s hypotension and altered mental status, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. She required mechanical ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen due to lethargy, somnolence, and respiratory failure (PCO2 45.3 mmHg). She was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and an oral potassium chloride tablet via nasogastric tube.\nIn addition to ventilatory support, she also required treatment for her severe acidemia with sodium bicarbonate. Her desired bicarbonate level was 24 mEq, and her bicarbonate deficit was calculated to be 365 mEq from the following formula: bicarbonate deficit = (0.5 × lean body weight) × (24- serum bicarbonate) []. Her lean body weight was calculated to be 44.5 kg from the following formula: lean body weight [kg] = 9270 × body weight [kg]/6680 + (216 x BMI [kg/m2]). We treated her with an overdose of 480 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose and water solution because her mental status and severe metabolic acidosis did not improve. The next day, her potassium was corrected to normal levels (4.2 mEq/L). However, we found acute hypernatremia with her sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. We began treating her with half-normal saline and 5% dextrose in water, and her serum sodium level gradually decreased from 172.8 mEq/L to 148.0 mEq/L over the course of six days (Figure ). As her hypernatremia was corrected, she became more alert and her weakness was greatly improved.\nSix days after the development of hypernatremia, several other symptoms became evident including dysarthria, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis. Because of these symptoms, we suspected ODS associated with acute hypernatremia. Consistent with our clinical suspicion, a brain MRI revealed symmetric, high-intensity signal in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting CPM (Figure ). Soon after this diagnostic confirmation of CPM, two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions for two days were started with a total of 4394 mL plasma exchanged with albumin 5%, crystalloids, and fresh frozen plasma. The day following the plasma exchange, she regained speech and became oriented. Her neurological symptoms, which included dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis, were markedly improved, but mild diplopia was present.\nAfter the patient was stabilized, we were able to work her up to explore the primary cause of her presenting symptoms. We suspected distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to the normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, a serum bicarbonate level < 10, hypokalemia, and urine pH of 6.5 (> 5.5), and due to the presence of a calyceal stone in her left kidney. We performed a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) loading test to confirm distal RTA []. In NaHCO3 loading test, 8.4% NaHCO3 solution was infused intravenously at a rate of 57 mEq/hour (1 mEq/kg/hour). Urine and blood samples were taken at 1-hour intervals and urine and blood PCO2 were measured using a blood gas analyzer. When the urine pH was raised to 7.6, urine PCO2, blood PCO2, urine HCO3, blood HCO3, urine creatinine and serum creatinine were 44.5 mmHg, 34.8 mmHg, 40.1 mEq/L, 25.8 mEq/L, 64.5 mg/dL, and 0.7 mg/dL, respectively. The results of NaHCO3 loading test revealed a fractionated excretion of HCO3 of 1.68% and the urine-to-blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B PCO2) of 9.7, suggesting distal RTA. In addition to the distal RTA, we also found that she had Sjögren’s syndrome after the results of Schirmer’s test and after she screened positive for anti-Lo and anti-Ra, which was confirmed by a salivary scan and lower lip biopsy. She was discharged and treated at an outpatient clinic with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. After one year of follow-up, her neurological symptoms were improved, but mild diplopia remained. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-2.94",
    "Upper Limit": "-2.66",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 142.8 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 125.5 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 7.6 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 142.8 mEq/L - (125.5 mEq/L + 7.6 mEq/L) = 9.7 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 9.7 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 9.7 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2 (in g/dL)) = 9.2 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 9.2 mEq/L. Plugging in 9.2 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 9.2 - 12 = -2.8 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -2.8 mEq/L.",

The operation was limited to the area below the knee. The patient had received spinal anesthesia without premedication. A lumbar puncture was performed at the L3-4 level using a 25-gauge Quincke needle with the patient in the right lateral position, and 3 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was administered. Loss of sensation to cold occurred below the T8 sensory dermatome. A complete inability to raise the legs straight (Bromage grade 3) was confirmed. Dexmedetomidine was administered for sedation—75 μg of dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously at the antecubital fossa for 10 min, followed by continuous infusion at a constant rate (1.0 μg/kg/h) using an infusion pump. The infusion was stopped 30 min before the end of the surgery. The operation proceeded uneventfully and lasted 225 min. The patient was then transferred to the general ward after observation in the postoperative care unit for 30 min. Approximately 7 h later, after hyperbaric bupivacaine administration, the patient involuntarily lifted the left lower leg (Figure ). Every two minutes, the patient’s left lower extremity involuntarily raised with hip flexion (Video).

The patient was on antihypertensive treatment for 15 years due to essential hypertension and he also used acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day. The patient did not have any a recent head or spinal trauma and surgical treatment, and he did not smoke.\nHe experienced sudden-onset severe neck pain and occipital headache on the third day of ACS treatment and felt muscle weakness and numbness in bilateral upper and lower extremities about 24 h after the onset of pain. On his physical examination, the patient was alert, orientated, and afebrile with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. The muscle strength of upper extremities was 2/5 proximally and 1/5 distally, while that of the lower extremities was 0/5 proximally and distally. There was anesthesia below the C4 dermatome. Also, no deep tendon reflex could be elicited. The rectal examination revealed reduced anal sphincter tone and anesthesia in the perineal region. Routine laboratory and coagulation parameters (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, and the international normalized ratio) were within normal limits. Neurology and neurosurgery consultations were requested, and urgent spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The MRI showed a space occupying formation extending from the level of C4 to T1 in the cervical spine which did not cause abnormal signal changes in the spinal cord and which was isointense in the T1-weighted images and heterogeneous signal intensity in the T2-weighted images. Spinal cord injury was assessed as Grade A complete injury according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale. The patient underwent emergency decompressive laminectomy and hematoma evacuation with the diagnosis of SSEH approximately 40 h after the onset of symptoms.

Twenty years earlier she was diagnosed with breast cancer, subjected to mastectomy and then treated with several chemotherapy lines, including the inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A Bevacizumab, hormonal therapy and local radiotherapy. About 5 months before the admission, she developed seizures and sudden cognitive impairment, with loss of contact: a MRI revealed cranial and cerebral metastasis. An antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam was started as well panencephalic radiotherapy was given for five days. Chemotherapy was also administered with resolution of symptoms and regression of metastasis. One month before the hospitalization, she developed lower limb deep vein thrombosis, so she started fondaparinux as anticoagulation therapy. The patient continued its oncological follow-up schedule of a stage IV breast cancer, with multiple liver, pleural, pulmonary and bone metastasis, treated with Palbociclib, anti-CDK4 and 6 antagonist and Fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor antagonist. At two follow-up visits during the 4 weeks prior to admission to the Emergency Department because of low circulating serum magnesium levels, magnesium and potassium salts supplementation was reported and then suspended due to the appearance of abdominal pain. She was sent to the Emergency department by the oncologist because of abdominalgia associated to nausea and vomiting. She has been treated with a proton pump inhibitor for at least 6 months because of heartburn, regurgitation, and symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease. An abdominal ultrasound highlighted abundant ascites. She was vigilant and collaborating, without alteration on neurological exam.

    "problem": "<Context> A 23-year-old male presented to our cardiovascular department with progressive exertional chest distress and fatigue for over one year. One month before the admission, the patient experienced novo occasional precordial pain in addition to the presenting symptoms. On admission, physical examinations revealed heart rate of 96 beats/minute with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure of 130/55 mmHg, high myopia, 190.5 cm of height and a diastolic murmur at the aortic valve area. Laboratory examinations for systemic vasculitis and infectious diseases were unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a giant aortic root aneurysm, an enlarged left ventricle (LV; 99 mm in end-diastolic dimension) and severe aortic regurgitation combined with extremely poor ejection fraction (EF; 18%). No mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation were observed. Enhanced thoracic CT scan performed with a 16-detector row confirmed the extensive dilated aortic root aneurysm, bulging against the sternum (Fig. a and b, asterisks; 125.1 mm in short-axis), while the morphology of the distal of ascending aorta and descending aorta were normal (30 mm in short-axis). Three-dimensional enhanced CT scan revealed that the aortic root aneurysm is like a “bulging balloon” (Fig. c, asterisk). According to the patient’s self-statement, both of his grandpa and father died from aortic dissection caused by MFS, and he was identified with FBN1 mutations when he was a child. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow up owing to his poor compliance. Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with MFS based on the Revised Ghent Criteria [].\nThe cardiac dysfunction of this patient was improved after receiving cardiotonic and diuretic therapy. After multidisciplinary discussion, surgical intervention, instead of continuously medical therapy, was accepted as reasonable and life-saving, in consideration of the risk of rupture/dissection of the aortic root aneurysm and deteriorating cardiac function. The specific surgical approaches should be decided based on the intraoperative exploration results. Elective femoral arteriovenous cardiopulmonary bypass was performed to avoid unexpected rupture of the giant aneurysm during median sternotomy. Following pericardiotomy, the aneurysm almost completely filled the pericardial cavity and compressed the right atrial and the pulmonary artery (Fig. a, asterisk). After clamping the aorta and opening the aneurysm sac, we observed a tricuspid aortic valve with multiple fenestrations occurring towards the commissures, a torn leaflet and a dilated aortic annulus which was measured over 38 mm. Further exploration verified the morphology of mitral valve was normal. Considering the patient’s poor cardiac function with bad aortic valvular condition and he may not be able to tolerate time-consuming procedures, we decided to perform Bentall procedure with a 28-mm conduit composite a 25-mm mechanical aortic valve (Fig. b). Postoperative three-dimensional enhanced CT scan revealed a normal sized reconstructed aortic root (Fig. c) and pre-discharge TEE examination confirmed the patient’s EF was improved to 40% and the LV end-diastolic dimension was reduced to 59 mm. The patient received anticoagulation therapy and he was discharged uneventfully 7 days later. Regular follow up was required to reduce the risk of anticoagulation-related complications. Moreover, enhanced thoracic CT scan and echocardiography examination were required at least once per year to monitor the morphology of valved conduit and the cardiac function and valvular condition of this patient. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 2-month old boy was admitted to our primary clinic because of poor weight gain, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Initially, he was thought to have electrolyte abnormalities caused by dehydration and discharged without an exact diagnosis. When he was 6 years old, he manifested voice change, acne, testicular enlargement, and premature pubarche. His height and weight were 124 cm (2.31 SDS) and 27 kg (2.63 SDS), respectively. The volume of each testis was 7 mL, the stretched penile length was 7 cm, and his bone age was 13 years by Greulich and Pyle's method, which was remarkably advanced for his chronological age. His serum 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OHP) and testosterone levels were elevated to 480 ng/mL (normal range: 0.32-3 ng/mL) and 2.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0.03-0.1 ng/mL), respectively. He was diagnosed with precocious puberty caused by CAH. He was treated with hydrocortisone (15 mg/m2/day) and 9α-fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day). However, he did not take medicine after 11 months of treatment. At age 17 years, he visited our outpatient clinic because of bilateral testicular enlargement and short stature. He was scheduled to be treated by surgical resection of testicular tumors because testicular biopsy demonstrated large, polygonal, and eosinophilic cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli, which are consistent findings with Leydig cell tumors (). His height and weight were 155.1 cm (-2.90 SDS) and 68 kg (0.49 SDS), respectively, and body mass index (BMI) was 30.2 (>97th percentile). He was normotensive (110/70 mmHg). His right and left testicles measured 10×6 cm, 7.5×4.5 cm, respectively (), with both being of firm consistency. His pubic hair Tanner stage was grade V. Gynecomastia and skin hyperpigmentation were noted. Radiography of left hand and wrist showed a closed epiphyseal plate. His serum 17-OHP concentration was 506.20 ng/mL (normal range: 0.32-3 ng/mL), ACTH level was 187.6 pg/mL (normal range: 2-49 pg/mL), plasma renin activity was 20.0 ng/mL/h (normal range: 0.4-8.8 ng/mL/h), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level was 270.6 µg/dL (normal range: 30-555 µg/dL). He had an androstenedione level of 18.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0.57-1.5 ng/mL), a luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration of 0.23 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.54-7.0 mIU/mL), a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 1.6 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.54-7.0 mIU/mL) and a testosterone level of 6.13 ng/mL (normal range: 3.5-9.7 ng/mL). His serum sodium and potassium concentrations were 141 mmol/L and 4.1 mmol/L, respectively, and serum α-fetoprotein and β-hCG levels were 1.4 ng/mL (normal range <20 ng/mL) and 1.0 mIU/mL (normal range <5 mIU/mL), respectively. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a 1.5 cm-sized adrenal adenoma on the left side and focal adrenal hyperplasia on the right side. Mutation analysis of CYP21A2 revealed a compound heterozygote, c.293-13A>G and c.1066C>T (p.R356W). To reduce the size of his tumors and to improve his hormonal profile, he was prescribed ACTH suppressive therapy with dexamethasone (0.25 mg tid). After 3 weeks, the tumors markedly regressed. The volume of each testis estimated using a Prader orchidometer was 25 mL (). His serum 17-OHP and ACTH concentrations had decreased to 1.0 ng/mL and 9.4 pg/mL, respectively, and serum testosterone concentration was reduced to 0.05 ng/mL (normal range: 3.5-9.7 ng/mL). He was switched from dexamethasone to prednisolone (5 mg twice a day) for maintenance, which had no effect on the volume of his testes. Following the switch, 17-OHP concentration was 19.8 ng/mL, ACTH concentration was 45.3 pg/mL, plasma renin activity was 20.0 ng/mL/h, and testosterone level was 3.0 ng/mL. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 17 years old. The patient's is a Male. The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 68.0 * (141.0/140 - 1) = 0.291 L. The patient's free body water deficit is 0.291 L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 43-year-old man (weight, 60.0 kg; height, 171.0 cm; body mass index, 20.5 kg/m2) was admitted to our hepatopancreatobiliary surgery department, an asymptomatic 14.0-cm mass in the right liver was diagnosed by ultrasound. The patient was infected by chronic HBV 20 years proir. The α-FP level was 1,000.00 ng/mL and the liver function was normal (Child-pugh A). CT scan showed that the liver was cirrhotic with a huge lesion in the right liver, which was considered as hepatocellular carcinoma, and a small lesion in the left liver was a typical hemangioma (). The FLR volume was calculated to be 356.0 cm3 (29.1% of 1,223.3 cm3 of the stander liver volume) based on the preoperative CT scan. It is reported that an FLR >30% of the stander liver volume is considered as a safe scope for hepatoectomy []. However, our criteria is FLR >45% of the stander liver volume for patients with cirrhosis. Given the high risk of postoperative liver failure for the patient, a 2-stage surgery should be adopted to increase the FLR. Although compared with portal vein embolization, ALPPS provides a better chance of complete resection for patients with primarily unresectable liver tumor, the morbidity from ALPPS was very high []. Thus, we decided to perform an AMAPS (a modified ALPPS) for this patient.\nIn the first stage of operation, abdominal laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. After abdominal exploration and cholecystectomy, the right hepatic pedicle was dissected carefully, and the right hepatic artery was isolated and tagged with the homemade rubber strip, which also reduced adhesion around the right hepatic artery by the large flat area. Then, the right portal vein was freed and ligated (). After the falciform ligament was divided, the future transection plane was marked with ultrasound guiding. The microwave antenna, which was guided by ultrasound, was inserted into the liver parenchyma on the right future transection plane, setting a 4-minute and 70 watts output cycle (). This manner was repeated step by step every 2.5 cm to create an avascular groove along the future transection plane.\nThe duration of the first-stage operation was 210 minutes with a blood loss of 100 mL with no need for blood transfusion or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The postoperative FLR was re-evaluated by CT scan weekly. The FLR was estimated at 430.6 cm3 (35.2% of the stander liver volume) after 1 week, and was increased to 500.3 cm3 (40.9% of the stander liver volume) after 2 weeks. On postoperative day 20, the volume of left hepatic was increased to 626.3 cm3 (51.2% of the stander liver volume; FLR increase 75.9%; daily FLR increase 13.5 cm3/day), without any metastatic tumors ().\nThe second-stage operation was performed 21 days after the first-stage operation. Little adhesion was found during the laparotomy. The right hepatic artery was easily identified and divided through the homemade rubber tag. The right portal vein was found below the right hepatic artery and was divided. Then, a bloodless blunt liver resection was performed along the future transaction plane with an anterior approach (). The right biliary duct was indentified and sutured during the parenchymal transection. The median and right hepatic veins were divided and sutured last.\nThe duration of the second-stage operation was 100 minutes with a blood loss of 200 mL, and there was no need for blood transfusion or ICU admission. The result of pathology demonstrated a hepatocellular carcinoma with poor differentiation, and the resection margin was tumor-free (R0). The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged on postoperative day 7. No tumor relapse or metastasis was detected (), and the α-fetoprotein level was normal at three months after the surgery. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

    "problem": "<Context> An 80-year-old woman (46 kg, 154 cm) was transported to our intensive care unit intubated and ventilated with recovery of spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary arrest (no-flow 15 minutes, low-flow 10 minutes). She reported dyspnea and syncope in her toilets following a pushing effort. She had no previous history of respiratory or cardiac disease. She is followed for giant cell arteritis and myelodysplasia without other medical history.\nInitial evolution was rapidly favorable, and the patient regained consciousness without sequelae. Etiologic assessment carried out initially did not explain this episode of cardiopulmonary arrest. CT-chest performed initially when the patient was intubated found a megaesophagus but no tracheal compression ().\nA week later, the patient presented an episode of acute respiratory distress with bradycardia during a meal. Faced by suspicion of inhalation pneumopathy, a bronchoscopy was performed but not finding of foreign bodies. In view of the presence of a pulmonary focus on chest X-ray (), diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was retained. The patient improved and returned home after few weeks.\nThree months later, the patient was rehospitalized in a state of acute respiratory distress, once again after a meal. At this time, new CT-chest without intubation found megaesophagus, this time with tracheal compression (). Bronchoscopy performed at this time revealed a TM with complete expiratory collapse and 80% inspiratory collapse associated with an inflammatory mucosa ().\nIn view of all these elements, we have retained the diagnosis of acute airway obstruction and cardiopulmonary arrest due to TM caused by megaesophagus compression secondary to achalasia. Achalasia was subsequently confirmed by esophageal manometry. No other cause of TM, in particular, no arguments for systemic infection or collagen vascular disease, was highlighted on various examinations. Please note that the patient's giant cell arteritis was perfectly controlled during these respiratory episodes.\nOn therapeutic plan, in front of patient advanced age and history of myelodysplasia with severe pancytopenia, surgery was not proposed. We proposed intraesophageal botulinum toxin injections under endoscopy to try to treat achalasia. The best treatment for TM is that of the cause. Following this treatment, the patient has not presented any cardiopulmonary arrest but she continued to have repeated lung infections. Unfortunately, she died two years later from a complicated lung infection. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 16-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of growth retardation and delayed puberty. He was born at full term to healthy and non-consanguineous Korean parents, with a birth weight and length of 3.0 kg (−0.30 standard deviation score [SDS]) and 50 cm (0.06 SDS), respectively. The heights of his father and mother were 174 cm (−0.08 SDS) and 170 cm (1.74 SDS). At the first visit, his height was 152.8 cm (−3.49 SDS) and weight was 42.7 kg (−2.82 SDS). There were no postnatal problems, such as microphallus and cryptorchidism, except bilateral ptosis. He underwent surgery for the correction of ptosis at the age of 4 years. He had no previous history of trauma or chronic illness. He complained of mild hypotonia when he exercised or did hard work. He felt frequent tiredness and muscle weakness in ordinary life. According to his mother, he worked alone at 15 months-old and his language development was also delayed when he was a young child. According to the results of his cognitive and intellectual function in the department of psychiatry at 18 years old, the full scale intelligence quotient was 75 according to the results of Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV administered at the age of 18. However, the social age for estimating social adaptation function was social quotient 84, and considering the stable subtest performance level, his intellectual ability was estimated to be at the lower average level (80–89). In the comprehensive attention test, a decrease in the function of interference in selective attention and divided attention was observed.\nFrom school age, he gradually showed a decrease in height velocity, and there has been no pubertal development in adolescence. He had two younger brothers who grew up normally without any growth and developmental issues and had no family history of genetic disorders. The blood pressure was 109/73 mmHg. His pubertal stage was assessed as Tanner 2 for the external genitalia development (testes volume 4 mL). He had dysmorphic craniofacial features, including an inverted triangular-shaped forehead, exaggerated Cupid's bow, arched eyebrows, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pterygium in the left eye with corneal opacity, mild ptosis and poorly expressive face (). He presented with mild hypotonia without other neurological symptoms and signs such as headache or visual disturbance. Laboratory tests for chemistry and thyroid hormone showed normal levels. The serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF binding protein-3 levels were 155.3 ng/mL (normal range: 360.0–885.0 ng/mL) and 1,698 ng/mL (normal range: 1,574–4,260 ng/mL), respectively. The bone age was over 2 years delayed. Two different provocative growth hormone (GH) testing, glucagon stimulation test and L-dopa stimulation test, revealed complete GHD as the result of low peak GH levels (0.34 and 1.99 ng/mL, respectively). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation testing showed early stage of puberty (peak luteinizing hormone 8.93 mlU/mL and peak follicle stimulating hormone 12.10 mIU/mL). Testosterone level was 0.23 ng/mL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a flattened pituitary gland and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space herniated into the sella turcica, which indicated ESS (). The other pituitary hormones showed normal levels. To identify the underlying genetic cause, we performed karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis, which showed unremarkable results. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed and a heterozygous novel nonsense variant, c.4185del; p.(Met1396Ter), in ZNF462 was identified, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (). This variant resulted from the deletion of nucleotides “C” in exon 3 of ZNF462, making stop codon in the protein-coding sequence, which was expected to produce truncated protein. This variant in ZNF462 has not been reported in a large population database as well as in the Genome Aggregation Database (). The patient's phenotype matched the typical phenotypes of previously reported individuals with WSKA. Segregation analysis using Sanger sequencing showed no ZNF462 variant in his mother. Although his father and two younger brothers could not undergo genetic tests for detecting the ZNF462 variant, there were no clinically affected family members. Therefore, this variant was categorized as pathogenic according to the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. There were no additional congenital anomalies such as congenital heart defects, optic nerve hypoplasia, papilledema and hearing impairment. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy was started at the dose of 0.23 mg/kg/week administered as daily subcutaneous injections and the dose of rhGH has been gradually increased up to 0.3 mg/kg/week until 18 years old. An improvement in height velocity (8 cm/year) was observed and his current height is 168.2cm (−1.15 SDS). Gradual pubertal progress (Tanner stage 2 for the external genitalia development, testes volume 6 mL at 18 years old) was also observed (). Now, he is 18 years 11 months-old and his bone age was estimated at 15 years. He continues rhGH replacement therapy and we consulted a urologist to evaluate and manage sexual maturity and fertility.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Inha University Hospital (No. 2020-08-014).

A week before, he had undergone a mitral valvuloplasty and Maze operation for severe mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. The patient had a history of hypertension and bronchial asthma. A follow-up ECG after the open heart surgery showed a sinus rhythm with a normal QTc interval (). Postoperative follow-up echocardiography showed mild mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 49%. Laboratory studies returned normal findings except for a prothrombin time of 2.20 international normalized ratio (INR) due to warfarin therapy. Electrolytes including potassium (4.2 mmol/L), magnesium (1.9 mg/dl) and ionized calcium (0.95 mmol/L) were within normal limits. No preoperative antibiotics were given.\nFor the emergency appendectomy, the patient was not premedicated. Monitoring included non-invasive blood pressure determination, ECG (lead II), pulse oximetry, and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO2) measurement. The vital signs included a blood pressure (BP) of 125/75 mmHg, a regular sinus rhythm heart rate (HR) of 85 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. Anesthesia was induced using mask administration of 100% oxygen. Etomidate (12 mg) and rocuronium (40 mg) were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated using an 8.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube.\nAnesthesia was maintained using 1 L/min O2, 1 L/min N2O, and 1.5-2.0 vol% sevoflurane. Ventilation was mechanically performed at a tidal volume of 600 ml and a rate of 12 breath/min. The ETCO2 was maintained between 31-35 mmHg. At the commencement of surgery, the patient had a BP of 100/65 mmHg, a regular sinus rhythm HR of 95 beats/min and 100% SpO2. The operation took approximately 1 hour, and proceeded unremarkably. The neuromuscular blocker was then reversed using 15 mg pyridostigmine and 0.4 mg glycopyrrolate. Extubation was performed without complications. At that time, the patient had a BP of 140/100 mmHg, 100% SpO2, and the ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a HR of 160 beats/min. As the patient recovered from anesthesia completely including alert mentation, spontaneous breathing, reversal of muscle tone, he was transferred to the PACU.\nWhile applying the monitoring instrument immediately after entering the PACU, the patient lost consciousness, ceased spontaneous breathing and a carotid pulse could not be palpated. BP was unmeasurable, the SpO2 was 36% and the ECG showed ventricular fibrillation. Mask ventilation was promptly initiated using an ambu-bag, chest compression was performed, and a direct current of 360 J was applied 3 times using a monophasic defibrillator. The ECG showed resolution of the ventricular fibrillation and appearance of a sinus rhythm. However, shortly thereafter TdP-type polymorphic ventricular tachycardia developed (). Defibrillation was performed 3 times, and 1 mg epinephrine and 110 mg lidocaine were intravenously administered. Additionally, magnesium sulfate 2 g was given intravenously over 10 min. The sinus rhythm returned with a HR of 80 beats/min, the BP increased to 166/80 mmHg and the SpO2 to 95%. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) with endotracheal intubation in a stable condition. The BP was 110/67 mmHg, the SpO2 was 98%, and an ECG showed QTc interval prolongation (617 ms) and a HR of 111 beats/min on arrival at the ICU. Norepinephrine (0.04 µg/kg/min), isosorbide dinitrate (1 µg/kg/min) and magnesium sulfate (2 g) were administered intravenously. The vital signs stabilized and norepinephrine infusion was ceased at 3 hours after ICU arrival. There was no necessity for supplement of electrolytes during ICU care, because all electrolytes were within normal limits including potassium (4.1 mmol/L), magnesium (2.2 mg/dl) and ionized calcium (0.9 mmol/L). In addition, no other drugs known to prolong QTc interval were administered. The patient was moved to the general ward on the 3rd postoperative day without relapse of TdP.\nWe retrospectively investigated the QTc interval and Tpeak-Tend interval (Tpe interval) identified on the ECG data ().

Episodes of palpitations every 3-4 weeks disappeared typically after 1-2 hours after taking flecainide. Systolic function was normal in an echocardiography one year before the actual admission. She was otherwise fit and without any other known cardiovascular disease.\nShe presented one evening to the Emergency Department of a referring hospital with persisting palpitations. The symptoms had started the evening before, and the usual 200 mg flecainide had been ineffective.\nClinical examination showed a fast, irregular heartbeat and was otherwise unremarkable. Blood pressure (BP) was 136/87 mmHg and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 98% in room air. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachyarrhythmic AF with 158 bpm ().\nThe next day 300 mg flecainide p.o. (the recommended dose for patients with >70 kg) was given, and one hour later, the patient reported malaise and dyspnea, which rapidly worsened and she became tachypneic and severely hypotonic. Echocardiography revealed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient was started on i.v. catecholamines and nasal oxygen and was urgently transferred to our center.\nUpon arrival, the patient was dyspneic, SpO2 96% with 2 l/min nasal oxygen, responsive and conscious, and BP was 100/48 mmHg under catecholamine support. ECG showed AF (120 bpm). Echocardiography revealed a severely reduced LVEF of only 18%. Chest X-ray showed pleural effusion and increased cardiothoracic ratio ().\nAs electrical cardioversion was unsuccessful, she was started on amiodarone. Bisoprolol was continued at 5 mg/day. Coronary angiography was unremarkable.\nHeart rate decreased to around 100 bpm, and over the following 7 hours, catecholamines were fully weaned. Cardiac MRI on the fifth day after admission showed LVEF of 41%, without signs of inflammation or myocardial fibrosis. One day later, she converted into SR. An elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was scheduled, and the patient was discharged with a full cardiovascular recovery ().

He had a history of failed intubation and emergent tracheostomy at birth due to severe micrognathia and glossoptosis. Granular tissue removal at the tracheostomy site was performed due to subglottic fibrosis four months after tracheostomy. Micrognathia and repaired cleft palate were identified by physical examination.\nWe decided to use 3D printed airway modeling, because there was a possibility of difficult intubation and it was difficult to predict the appropriate endotracheal tube size. The open-source program InVersalius (InVersalius 3.0, Renato Archer Information Technology Center, Brazil) was used for 3D printed airway modeling and for the generation of .stl files, and the 3D airway model was printed using CreatBot (CreatBot F430, Henan Suwei Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., China). The 3D printed airway model did not reveal airway narrowing (), and simulation of endotracheal intubation was successful with an internal diameter (ID) 5.5 sized cuffed endotracheal tube (Hi-contour oral cuffed tracheal tube, Covidien, USA) ().\nThe patient had a small chin and his range of movement from ear to orbit was estimated to be over 120 degrees (). General anesthesia induction and intubation were planned with reference to the difficult airway algorithm described in the 2013 American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines []. Before the induction of anesthesia, ID 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes were secured, and pre-emptive preparations were made for laryngeal mask airway, video laryngoscope (KoMAC video laryngoscope, KoMAC Co., Ltd., Korea), stylet, nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal airway, and fiberoptic bronchoscope. Mask ventilation was possible after the administration of intravenous thiopental 75 mg, followed by rocuronium 10 mg. Successful endotracheal intubation was performed via video laryngoscopy with a #2 blade, a stylet, and an ID 5.5 cuffed endotracheal tube. Ventilation was performed after confirming the suitability of the endotracheal tube using a leakage test.

Examination of other systems was normal.\nAdmission electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed new T wave inversions in the lead II, III, AVF and QS complexes and T wave Inversions in V1-V6 as seen in the previous EKG (Fig. ). Admission chest X-ray showed normal cardiac silhouette with presence of pacemaker leads, normal lung fields and mediastinum.\nHer initial set of cardiac enzymes, complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP) and urine analysis were normal. She was admitted with diagnosis of unstable angina. Treatment with heparin, eptifibatide and nitroglycerine was begun. Her repeat EKG on 09/07/09 showed ST depressions in the inferior leads, repeat cardiac enzymes were normal, however her chest pain continued to persist. 2D Echocardiogram (ECHO) on 09/07/09 revealed ejection fraction (EF) of 65%, without any pericardial effusion. Chest pain continued to persist, became hypotensive and oliguric, blood pressure medications were with held. Repeat CBC and BMP revealed elevated WBC 15,800/μl and hemoglobin of 9.4 gm/dl.

    "problem": "<Context> A 54-year-old Haitian male with a past medical history of multiple myeloma diagnosed one year prior was admitted to Broward Health Medical Center due to septic shock and acute renal injury. He had his last chemotherapy session for the multiple myeloma over 3 months ago and was lost to follow-up since that time period. Symptomatically, he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 3 days after returning from a trip to Haiti.\nInitial vital signs included temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 86/40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. Labs showed a white blood cell count of 2.85 × 103/μL, hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit 25.5%, platelets 43 × 103/μL, segmented neutrophils 76%, bands 8%, and lymphocytes 12%. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed sodium 144 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 119 mmol/L, bicarbonate 12 mmol/L, BUN 31 mg/dL, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase 55 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 65 units/L, and albumin 2 g/dL. Initial X-ray and CT of the chest did not indicate any acute infiltrates. A CT of the abdomen showed mild circumferential wall thickening of the colon extending from the cecum to the rectum indicative of colitis. Aggressive IV fluid hydration was initiated and he was empirically started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Initial blood cultures preliminarily grew gram negative rods, at which time levofloxacin was added to his regimen.\nWithin 48 hours of admission he began to experience worsening respiratory distress and severe tachypnea, with ABG indices showing a pH of 7.26, pCO2 of 43, pO2 of 64, base excess of (−8), and O2 saturation of 91%. Patient was switched to a nonrebreather. He was found to be fluid overloaded with a significant positive fluid balance. The patient had to be placed on BiPap and diuresed with bumetanide. Repeat chest X-ray indicated new right upper lobe infiltrates. After being stabilized he was weaned back to 4 L of O2 via nasal cannula.\nBlood culture identification showed growth of Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139. Based on identification and susceptibility studies, antibiotic treatment was deescalated to intravenous levofloxacin. The bacterial strain was isolated and identified by the Florida Department of Health in Jacksonville, FL.\nHowever, the patient's clinical status once again deteriorated. He began to develop episodes of copious hemoptysis and worsening thrombocytopenia. Intermittent platelet transfusions and a trial of desmopressin were started; however no significant increase in platelet count was seen. Patient's respiratory status continued to worsen through his course progressing to respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation. He continued to have bloody secretions suctioned from the endotracheal tube. Chest X-rays indicated worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates. In the setting of continued bloody secretions it was felt that the radiological findings may correlate with pulmonary hemorrhage.\nPatient was sent to the operating room for tracheostomy placement and oral packing by the otolaryngologist. Secondary to the extensive amount of oropharyngeal bleeding, vaginal pads were required. The patient was also started on aminocaproic acid, a fibrinolytic inhibitor without any significant improvement. He continued to require full ventilator support and was too hemodynamically unstable to attempt weaning from the ventilator. As his clinical status deteriorated further, he became less responsive and comatose. A CT of the brain revealed a 2 cm hemorrhage in the left cerebellum with mild surrounding edema. He later underwent cardiac arrest and was unable to be revived, ultimately succumbing to his illness. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 119.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 119.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 119.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 119.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 119.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 119.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 12.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 12.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 12.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 12.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 12.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 12.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (119.0 mEq/L + 12.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 2.0 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 13.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.0 (in g/dL)) = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 18.0 mEq/L.",

The patient’s height and body weight were 167 cm and 53 kg, respectively. Upon arrival, his consciousness was slightly decreased, blood pressure was 72/32 mmHg, and pulse was 74/min. The oxygen saturation was 92% after providing 3 L of oxygen. Physical examination showed a painful pulsatile abdominal mass. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed AAA measuring 61×61 mm and a large hematoma at its right side (). However, we did not recognize the anomaly of the IVC on arrival. Laboratory examination showed: red blood cells, 363×104/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; hematocrit, 32.4%; and white blood cells, 197.9×102/µL. As our hospital did not stock stent-grafts for AAA and it could take more than 2 h to obtain the grafts, we planned open repair for the ruptured AAA in a hemodynamically unstable condition. In a supine position, firstly, a touch-up balloon for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was percutaneously inserted via a 16Fr. sheath from the right common femoral artery to control the bleeding. Secondly, AAA was carefully exposed using an abdominal middle incision. However, AAA was covered with a large hematoma, and an expanded vein was in contact with its left side. It was not until we were unable to locate the IVC on the right side of AAA that we recognized the IVC anomaly. Moreover, although the neck of AAA was nearly 3 cm in length, it was not easy to expose the neck due to an about 2-cm-long expanded left renal vein running just above it. Although we reviewed CT data, we were confused regarding whether the case was a duplicated or left-sided IVC. Thus, we decided to preserve the left renal vein to join the left-sided IVC (). The left renal vein was fully exposed and taping of the vein was performed. Division of the testicular and lumbar veins as well as the adrenal vein allowed retraction of the left renal vein. After the systemic administration of heparin, the just infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped while pulling the vein caudally and bilateral common iliac arteries were clamped. While pulling the vein cranially, proximal anastomosis was performed. Subsequently, a 20×10-mm bifurcated vascular prosthesis (Gelsoft Plus, TERUMO Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was implanted (). The operative time was 313 min, and total blood loss was 2,532 mL. Postoperative enhanced CT showed the duplicated IVC ().

Five months previously, an invasive ductal breast carcinoma (pT2, pTis, pN0, cM0 and R0) had been diagnosed, and the patient underwent breast-conserving tumour resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. On admission, the patient appeared to be in a good general condition (weight 53 kg, height 168 cm and BMI 19 kg/m2) and seemed only slightly affected. Vital signs were normal (blood pressure 130/60 mmHg and heart rate 80 bpm), and physical examination was unremarkable. The patient’s medication included letrozole, calcium and vitamin D3. Previous administration of alendronate had been stopped before admission. Laboratory testing showed impaired renal function with a creatinine of 297 μmol/L and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 14 mL/min/1.73 m2. Serum calcium level was significantly elevated (3.6 mmol/L) in the presence of slightly lowered serum albumin (31 g/dL). A blood count showed normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 11,5 g/dL), leucocytopaenia (2840/μL) and a normal platelet count; a differential blood count revealed significant lymphocytopaenia (227/μL). Further biochemical tests demonstrated hyperphosphataemia (2.4 mmol/L) but normal values for parathyroid hormone and C-reactive protein. Urinalysis showed signs of prevailing tubulointerstitial nephritis with minor leucocyturia, predominant tubular proteinuria and mild haematuria.\nA diagnostic work-up was performed to establish the cause of hypercalcaemia and bicytopaenia and to identify the underlying renal disease. A skeletal scintigraphy ruled out bone metastatic disease, and abdominal ultrasound did not show any isolated metastases or a tumour mass. Renal ultrasound demonstrated kidneys of normal size with hyperechoic parenchyma and hypoechoic pyramids as well as signs of nephrocalcinosis. Computed tomography of the chest revealed two new very small nodular lesions in both upper lobes; however, there was no notion of enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes. Spirometric testing was within the normal range (FEV1 85%, VCin 99%, FEV1/VCin 90% and pO2 84 mHg). Subsequent bronchoscopy showed a macroscopically normal bronchial system, and bronchoalveolar lavage did not reveal suspicious cells or any infectious pathogen but a lymphocytic cell profile with an elevated T4/T8 ratio of 5.5. A renal biopsy was performed: histopathology displayed a few moderate epithelioid cell granulomas with interstitial nephritis, slight nephrocalcinosis and moderate focal tubular atrophy, suggesting sarcoid nephropathy (A and B). Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated impaired haematopoiesis with slight siderosis, moderate plasmocytosis and surprisingly also an epithelioid cell granuloma (C), consistent—although non-specific—with manifestation of sarcoidosis. Immunophenotyping of the bone marrow revealed CD138/CD19-positive plasma cells, but no light chains or any other B- or T-cell clonal disease. Revision of a lymph node biopsy, previously performed for staging of the breast cancer, also revealed an epithelioid cell granuloma (D). Further laboratory testing was negative for immunological antibodies, including antinuclear antibodies and c- and p-ANCAs, but showed elevated serum levels for angiotensin-converting enzyme (137 U/L, normal < 52). Echocardiography demonstrated moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function and slight diastolic dysfunction.\nAltogether, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis with renal, pulmonary, bone marrow and lymph node involvement was made, while cardiac manifestation was suspected. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in significantly improved renal function within several days, normalized calcium and phosphate values, and led to a haemoglobin and leucocyte count within the normal range.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL). The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 31.0 g/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 3.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 3.6 mmol. To convert 3.6 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.6 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.16 g Calcium. To convert 0.16 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.16 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 160.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 160.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 16.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 3.6 mmol Calcium/L converts to 16.0 mg Calcium/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 31.0 g/dL)) + 16.0 mg/dL = -5.6 mg/dL. The patient's corrected calcium concentration -5.6 mg/dL.",

Her hypertension was uncontrolled before cerebral infarction, but it became controlled after taking the medication for hypertension. The patient never smoked and had no history of autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions.\nCerebral angiography revealed a small SCA aneurysm with a broad neck, with a maximum diameter of 2.62 mm and a neck diameter of 2.73 mm. In addition, there was narrowing of both anterior cerebral arteries (ACA), which could lead to extensive cerebral infarction. Because the unruptured SCA aneurysm was small and unlikely to rupture, it was determined to be followed with periodic brain imaging. A dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) was used because of severe stenosis of the ACA.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea that started 3 days prior. She complained of anorexia, nausea, dyspnea on exertion, and chest pain. There was no complaint of cough, sputum, rhinorrhea, or chills.

The patient presented the following vital signs: blood pressure, 136/66 mmHg; heart rate, 78 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.7 °C. The results of arterial blood gas analysis were the following: pH, 7.422; PaCO2, 38.3 mmHg; PaO2, 57 mmHg; SaO2, 88.1% (2 L/min of oxygen with a nasal prong). Laboratory test results were: hemoglobin, 11.5 g/dL; white blood cell count, 7410 cells/μL (neutrophils, 65.1%; lymphocytes, 24.3%; monocytes, 9.0%; eosinophils, 0.9%; and basophils, 0.7%); platelet count, 327,000 cells/μL; and C-reactive protein, 1.6mg/dL. The following serum biochemistry results were within normal limits: aspartate aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 5 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.7 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 59 IU/L; total protein, 7.0 g/dL; albumin, 3.5 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 7 mg/dL; and creatinine, 0.57 mg/dL. Forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity were 1.02 L (predicted, 75%) and 1.07 L (predicted, 52%), respectively, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was 2.6 mL/mmHg/min (predicted, 19%). Congestive heart failure was excluded because of normal ultrasound cardiography results and a normal level of serum brain natriuretic peptide.\nEmpirical antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours plus levofloxacin 75 mg every 24 hours) were administered because bacterial pneumonia was not ruled out based on chest radiography findings. Enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) revealed symmetric peribronchial ground-glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, and consolidation in both lungs ( and ).\nThe patient had fever (37.8 °C) on the second day of hospitalization. In addition, oxygen saturation could not be maintained at 5 L/min via nasal prong, and oxygen was administered via a high-flow nasal cannula (30 L/min; FiO2, 35%). On day 4, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to rule out diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and atypical pneumonia. Bacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral PCR, Cytomegalovirus PCR, Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR, fungal culture, and acid-fast bacilli smear were performed in BAL samples. BAL samples revealed a clear color fluid, and no microorganisms were detected from any of the examinations. Nonetheless, patient’s clinical symptoms continued to deteriorate.\nOne day 5, and clopidogrel-associated ILD was suspected after ruling out all other possible causes of her symptoms. We changed dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel to aspirin and initiated intravenous treatment with 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone. Clinical signs and chest X-ray improved after clopidogrel withdrawal and steroid treatment (). The patient was discharged with oral prednisolone (25 mg/day) on day 21 of hospitalization. The steroid dose was tapered over 6 months in the outpatient setting. A follow-up chest radiograph at 6 months after discontinuation of steroid treatment showed no recurrence, and the patient’s health status was good (). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "1.95",
    "Upper Limit": "2.156",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L. The patient's concentration of AST is 19.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of ALT is 5.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of platelets is 327000.0 count/µL. To convert 327000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 327000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 327000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 327000000000.0/(10^9) = 327.0 billion platelet counts per liter. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (79 * 19.0)/(327.0 * sqrt(5.0)) = 2.053. Hence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 2.053.",

Her previous medical history was unremarkable. The routine monitors including an electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oxymetry were used. General anesthesia was induced with intravenous 1% lidocaine 40 mg, propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 50 mg via a preexisting 18-gauge IV catheter in the vein on the left antecubital area without difficulty. The trachea was intubated, and ventilation was controlled. General anesthesia was maintained with 6 vol% desflurane and 50% N2O in oxygen. A right radial artery catheter was inserted successfully to allow continuous monitoring of the arterial blood pressure. A 16-gauge catheter was also placed in a large vein on the dorsal surface of the left foot. It was confirmed that both intravenous catheters functioned well. The patient was then placed in the prone position on the operating table. The patient's arm was tucked at her sides with her palms facing inward against the lateral thighs under the draw sheet.\nTo prevent a risk of chest compression, two chest rolls were placed under the both lateral chest walls. The placement of chest rolls was checked to confirm that they had been placed correctly under the medial wall of the axilla. No surgical bolster or padding was applied under the axilla because her arms had been tucked to her side. The NIBP was measured using an automated oscillatory blood pressure cuff on the left upper arm every 20 minutes and a pulse oximeter probe was placed on the right thumb. All medication was injected through the IV catheter on the left foot, not into the left arm. The patient received 700 ml of a crystalloid solution through the left arm IV catheter. Nothing unusual was noted intraoperatively. However, the area of the left arm covered with drapes was unavailable for a direct inspection. The operation lasted for 4 hours.\nAfter undraping at the end of surgery, the left forearm and hand of the patient were found to be quite swollen with many blisters (). The left upper extremity was very cool and cyanotic, and the radial pulses were not palpable well. The pulse oximeter did not detect any waveforms on the left hand. Digital capillary refill was found to be delayed compared to the contralateral extremity. The NIBP cuff and left antecubital catheter were removed. A hand surgeon was rapidly consulted and a fasciotomy was performed on the forearm and dorsal surface of the hand to reduce the increased pressure of the compartments. A large amount of fluid, which was likely to be an extravasated crystalloid solution, was drained when the surgeon squeezed the patient's arm during the fasciotomy.\nThe patient was extubated in the operating room. In the post anesthesia care unit, a physical examination revealed palpable radial arterial pulses and normal capillary refilling. The pulse oximeter probe successfully detected a waveform and an arterial saturation appeared to be 100%. In the intensive care unit, edema of the forearm and hand gradually subsided over several days. She was discharged with full function of her left arm. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 39-year-old apparently healthy woman complained of fever and productive cough, in March, 2017. Her medical history did not reveal any specific illness, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, collagen disease, and congenital immunodeficiency. She neither smoked nor consumed alcohol. Three days after onset (clinical day 3), she was admitted to a local general hospital, owing to progressive fever, malaise, and anorexia. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.2 °C; blood pressure, 106/64 mmHg; pulse, 80 beats/min with a regular rhythm; SpO2, 97% in an air-conditioned room; and respiratory rate, 16 breaths/min. Cyanosis, cardiac murmur, and abnormal breath sounds were absent. The patient’s liver, spleen and lymph nodes were not palpable. Her white blood cell count was 5600/μL, with a shift to the left (81.2% neutrophils). Her aspartate aminotransferase level was 23 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 206 IU/L; and C-reactive protein, 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 0–0.3 mg/dL). Moreover, the patient’s chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) images revealed subsegmental consolidation in her right lower lobe (Figs. a, f). After admission, administration of ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT), at 6 g/day, was initiated under a clinical diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia. Azithromycin (AZM) was also given at 2 g/day p.o. stat on clinical day 3 (Fig. ). Her indirect hemagglutination titer for MP was negative (1:40) on clinical day 4. After admission (clinical day 7), her fever had not subsided, and the pulmonary lesions had extended to the entire right lower lobe as well as to the left lower lobe (Figs. b, g). Thus, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a transbronchial biopsy of the right lower lobe were performed. These examinations revealed nonspecific inflammation with neutrophil infiltration, but no pathogen was identified on pathological or microbiological examination. Contrary to the extremely rapid progression of the pulmonary lesions, her general condition had not significantly deteriorated, which was not compatible with severe bacterial infection. Owing to the unique clinical presentation, organizing pneumonia was considered. Therefore, treatment with prednisolone (PSL) was initiated at 40 mg/day from clinical day 7, and steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day) was given on clinical days 10–12. However, neither her symptoms nor her pulmonary lesion improved (Figs. c, h). Rather, her respiratory failure had worsened significantly, after steroid pulse therapy (clinical day 14), as she required oxygen inhalation at 15 L/min on her motion; therefore, she was transferred to our hospital (Hokkaido University hospital) for further examination and treatment. Considering the existence of lower respiratory tract infection due to any rare pathogens, ABPC/SBT was changed to meropenem (MEPM) on clinical day 14, and levofloxacin (LVFX) and minocycline (MINO) were also initiated concurrently. On admission (clinical day 14), her indirect hemagglutination titer for MP had elevated to 1:2560, which was more than that identified on clinical day 4 at the referring hospital. Moreover, BAL fluid (BALF) examination, which was performed on the day of admission to our hospital, using Ribotest™ Mycoplasma (Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation, Japan), yielded positive results for the mycoplasma antigen. No other pathogen was identified on microbiological examination of the BALF. Based on these clinical findings, we confirmed our case as severe life-threatening MP pneumonia. Thereafter, we continued empirical antibiotic therapy with LVFX, MINO and MEPM, and corticosteroid therapy with PSL at 40 mg/day. Two days later (clinical day 16), her fever, malaise, and hypoxia had resolved, and her pulmonary lesions had significantly improved (Fig. d). Therefore, we replaced the antibiotics with garenoxacin (GRNX) as monotherapy, at 400 mg/day, and reduced the dosage of PSL from clinical day 18. The patient was discharged on day 24, and administration of GRNX and corticosteroid therapy were continued until clinical day 30 (Fig. ). Subsequently, she had an uneventful recovery with no recurrence of fever or pneumonia.\nDue to the rarity of our patient’s clinical course, we performed further molecular identification using DNA extracted from her BALF. DNA of MP was identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Mp181-F and Mp181-R primer pairs and an Mp181-P probe []. A previously described RFLP analysis of point mutation in domain V of MP 23SrRNA gene [] was used to identify mutations known to confer macrolide resistance (2063, 2064, and 2617 in the MP 23S rRNA gene domain V region). The result of the molecular analysis was positive for A2063G mutation, which was, at that time, a common macrolide-resistant mutant of MP in Japan. Based on these results and the clinical course, we confirmed our case as severe MP pneumonia due to a macrolide-resistant strain. </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "3",
    "Upper Limit": "3",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 39.2 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 80.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 5600.0 count/µL. To convert 5600.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 5600.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 5600000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3.

He also developed fever and experienced back pain for approximately 1 week. Earlier, he had been walking with the assistance of a walker. He reported a history of aortic valve replacement surgery, mitral valvuloplasty, and tricuspid valvuloplasty, in addition to a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, obstructive arteriosclerosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, spinal canal stenosis, and dementia. Therefore, his general health condition was deemed poor. He was taking aspirin, apixaban, furosemide, spironolactone, and insulin. Echocardiography showed poor wall motion with an ejection fraction of 41% and pulmonary hypertension (65/13 mmHg).\nWe were unable to obtain detailed information regarding neurological symptoms such as sensory disturbance and movement disorder because of the severe dementia. He could not flex his right knee, although he could briefly flex his left knee in the supine position. He also complained of severe back pain (face rating scale [FRS] = 4) at rest, which increased with body movement (FRS = 5). Except for an elevated temperature (38.0 °C), his vital signs were stable. Blood examination revealed a slight increase in C-reactive protein (3.64 mg/dl) and white blood cell count (10,300/μl).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive fluid retention in the spinal epidural space (Th6 to L3) and compression of the spinal cord (Th6/7, Th11/12, L2/3) (Fig. ). The latter suggested paraplegia due to an epidural abscess. We performed emergency drainage using fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous puncture. The patient was placed in the prone position and received local anesthesia, following which any abscess near Th6/7, Th11/12, and L2/3 was punctured using a 14 G Tuohy needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Approximately 3 ml of purulent discharge was drained from the Th6/7 and L2/3 levels, and approximately 4 ml of a clear, light-yellow colored discharge was drained from the Th11/12 level. For involved areas near Th6/7, two needles were placed at the Th6/7 and Th8/9 levels, respectively. A 5-Fr catheter was placed under fluoroscopic guidance using a guide wire, followed by perfusion with saline until apparent removal of the corpuscles. MRI performed 1 day later showed relief from the compression due to the abscess. Three weeks later, the abscess had completely disappeared (Fig. ).\nAt the time of admission, provisional treatment with meropenem, clindamycin, and vancomycin was initiated and continued for 3 days. The prescription was de-escalated to cefazolin and clindamycin after group G streptococcus was detected in the abscess, and the treatment was continued for 28 days. Blood cultures were negative. Pain on movement (FRS = 2) reduced after the drainage procedure, while pain at rest also improved (FRS = 1) after 3 days. The muscle weakness gradually resolved, and he could walk to a portable toilet without assistance 20 days after the procedure. He was discharged to a nursing home for the elderly on the 57th day. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

She had been experiencing these symptoms for two weeks, with the neck swelling becoming progressively worse. On physical exam the patient appeared ill with a heart rate of 139, blood pressure of 87/36 and temperature 101.1, indicating septic shock. Physical exam revealed a large fluctuant mass over the left lateral neck. The center of this mass exhibited blackish discoloration and skin necrosis.

    "Lower Limit": "-0.11",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.0997",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 125.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 125.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 5.0 mEq/L) = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 10.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 10.0 - 12 = -2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -2.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -2.0 mEq/L / 19.0 mEq/L = -0.105. The patient's delta ratio is -0.105.",

She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques.

Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis.

Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme.

Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "8.55",
    "Upper Limit": "9.45",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 3.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 19.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.2 (in g/dL)) = 21.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 21.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 21.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 21.0 - 12 = 9.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 9.0 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 63-year-old male with hypertension and seizure disorder presented to the renal clinic with a blood pressure of 220/110 mmHg, headache and neck pain and was sent to the emergency department. His review of systems showed that he had a 2-month history of bilateral ankle pain, anasarca, progressive renal impairment, weakness and fatigue, associated with a history of loss of appetite for this period of time. A renal workup revealed nephrotic-range proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, with urinalysis showing red cells and protein. CBC showed a hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, white cell count of 7.7 K/uL and a platelet count of 146 K/uL. Blood chemistry showed sodium of 146 mmol/L. potassium of 4.5 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, chloride of 113 mmol/L, BUN of 61 mg/dL and a creatinine of 4.08 mg/dL. Serology was negative for antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, lupus anticoagulant, cryoglobulins and viral markers (HBV, HCV and HIV). Complement levels were normal. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were negative for a monoclonal protein. Although he had slightly low haptoglobin, his ADAMTS13 level was within normal limits. A renal core biopsy showed predominantly medulla and a small cortical sample, containing up to 12 glomeruli of which one glomerulus was globally sclerosed. All patent glomeruli showed segmental or global occlusion of capillary loops by PAS-positive eosinophilic pseudothrombi which were non-argyrophilic and stained magenta red on trichrome (Fig. a-c); some of the glomeruli had a membranoproliferative pattern associated with mild mesangial hypercellularity and segmental double contours (Fig. b, PAS stain). A single artery sampled showed moderate arteriosclerosis but no thrombi. The interstitium was unremarkable except for patchy fibrosis. On immunofluorescence microscopy (IF), the pseudothrombi stained for IgA, kappa and lambda (Fig. d-f) and were negative for the other immunoreactants; some pseudothrombi also showed intensely staining bright foci that were more numerous in kappa than in lambda (arrow). Electron microscopy (EM) of 2 glomeruli showed several capillary loops lined by swollen endothelial cells, with occluding intra-luminal electron-dense crystals; all the crystals showed a lattice-like substructure with parallel linear arrays. No conventional immune complex-type electron-dense deposits or fibrin tactoids were seen within the glomeruli (Fig. a-c). Crystals were also not seen within proximal tubular epithelial cells. Occasional loops showed mild subendothelial widening along with rare cell interposition. A diagnosis of crystalglobulin-associated nephropathy (CAN) with possible kappa restriction was favored. Paraffin-IF with pronase digestion could not be performed as no glomeruli remained in the paraffin block. Subsequent testing with immunogold EM showed preferential association of kappa particles for the crystals, confirming kappa restriction of the crystals (Fig. d-f). A repeat serum electrophoresis 3 months later showed IgA kappa and trace amount of IgG lambda while urinary protein electrophoresis remained negative; a free light chain assay showed a kappa/lambda ratio of 3.9. Bone marrow and peripheral blood flow cytometry at this time showed a small clonal B-cell population (0.19 K/uL) with kappa restriction and a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) phenotype, co-expressing CD5 and CD23 and being negative for CD10 and CD103. No organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was present in the patient. A diagnosis of CAN presenting as MGRS in the background of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) was confirmed in the patient. Since the diagnosis, the patient has been dialysis-dependent. A hemato-oncology referral was sought in view of the patient’s MGRS finding but because of the low clonal B-cell count coupled with extreme frailty and recurrent episodes of C.difficile diarrhea in the patient, no specific hematologic treatment was decided to be initiated by the clinical team till the patient became clinically more stable. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

He had experienced a 2-kg weight loss over the last few days. His usual medications included aspirin 100 mg q24 h, atorvastatin 40 mg q24 h, and metformin 850 mg q8 h, which had been switched to dapagliflozin 20 days before, due to poor glycemic control, with HbA1c 12% (108 mmol/mol).

The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. Because of the right bundle branch block was not previously known, a new troponin test was performed six hours later with a peak value of 4.28 ng/mL. Treatment with crystalloids, continuous infusion of intravenous insulin, and administration of potassium and sodium bicarbonate were begun in the emergency room (ER). Due to a poor response over the first two hours, with the persistence of lactic acidosis, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where more aggressive rehydration with crystalloids was started, without further modifications of the original therapeutic plan.\nTwo days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the endocrinology ward. Because of his coronary risk factors and the elevated troponin on admission, a coronary angiography was performed, showing triple-vessel disease.

The liver biopsy showed changes consistent with chronic persistent hepatitis, the inflammatory and fibrotic changes were both graded 1 according to the scoring method []. Together with additional biochemical and immunological studies, other causes of persistent abnormal liver function tests were excluded. In view of her vitiligo, hepatitis C and biochemical disturbance, the Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test (AST), also known as the Cosyntropin or Short Synacthen test, was performed which revealed the presence of subclinical adrenal insufficiency (AI), additional file . Further investigations for the causes of AI revealed positive adrenal cell antibody (ACA) serology. Computerised tomographic scan showed small adrenal glands bilaterally with normal anatomy and appearance.\nThe patient underwent routine combination treatment of Interferon-α2β (IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks for her genotype 1 HCV infection. The patient's subclinical adrenal disease was also followed closely using salivary as well as serum cortisol levels to assess the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) every 12 weeks, starting at baseline, during treatment, 6 and 12 month follow-ups. The results suggested a progressive decline of her adrenal function during the treatment phase. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was seriously considered but with apprehension due to possible exacerbation of the hepatitis.

Her abdominal pain was managed with immediate-release oxycodone, which was a chronic home medication. Additionally, she was given pantoprazole for prophylaxis against reactive gastropathy, since she was receiving stress-dose hydrocortisone after having recently been hospitalized for adrenal insufficiency secondary to withdrawal of steroids.\nOn physical examination she was in no acute distress with stable vital signs including temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 75 bpm, blood pressure 103/55 mm Hg and respiratory rate 18/min. Her weight was 50.8 kg (31st percentile), height 158.5 cm (25th percentile) and BMI 19.9 (38th percentile). She did not have any oral ulcerations or rash, and her abdomen was soft, non-tender and had active bowel sounds.\nFurther investigation was conducted since initial medical management failed to produce clinical improvement. It was feared that she had developed graft-versus-host disease. Laboratory data revealed no dyselectrolytemia, alanine transaminase 33 U/l (normal 13–69 U/l), aspartate transaminase 47 U/l (normal 15–46 U/l), alkaline phosphatase 69 U/l (normal 38–126 U/l), total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl and albumin 3.9 g/dl. Blood cell counts showed white blood cells 9,000/μl (normal 4,000–104,000/μl), platelets 158,000/μl (normal 150,000–350,000/μl), hemoglobin 11 g/dl (normal 11.7–15 g/dl), hematocrit 31% (normal 35–44%), mean corpuscular volume 90 fl (normal 81–96 fl), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 35 g/dl (normal 32–36 g/dl) and red blood cell distribution width 17% (normal 11.5–14%). Infectious studies including a respiratory viral panel, blood culture and stool testing for Clostridium difficile were negative. Routine surveillance testing was negative for Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and BK virus.\nPediatric gastroenterology was consulted for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the patient's nausea, emesis and abdominal pain. An upper endoscopy was performed with a gastroscope GIF 190. A large gastric phytobezoar consisting of undigested vegetables was discovered (fig. ). Cold forceps, in closed position, were used to probe the mass. One liter of saline was used for irrigation. Part of the phytobezoar was fragmented and removed with a Roth Net standard retriever and a Platinum retriever (US Endoscopy). However, the bezoar could not be fully extracted, so 3 l of Coca-Cola were administered through a nasogastric tube over 12 h to dissolve the remaining fragments. Pantoprazole was discontinued to allow gastric acidity to aid in fiber digestion. She was advised to limit her intake of fiber in order to prevent recurrence. Lastly, polyethylene glycol with electrolytes was given to assist with motility and removal of the phytobezoar remnants. Gastric biopsy obtained to evaluate for Helicobacter pylori was ultimately negative. A swallow study obtained after treatment with Coca-Cola did not show any filling defects within the stomach or duodenum. She was seen for follow-up 1 and 5 weeks after discharge. Her abdominal pain and emesis had resolved and her nausea was significantly improved. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

There was no history of trauma or bisphosphonate use for osteoporosis and the pain was activity-related and relieved partially by rest or elevation. In the past medical history, no special diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular diseases were present and she was a non-smoker and a non-drinker. The physical examination showed mild localized tenderness in the medial aspect of the ankle and no swelling. The range of motion of the ankle was full, and stability was intact. She was 157 cm in height, had a body weight of 58 kg, and her body mass index was 23.5 kg/m2. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured utilizing peripheral quantitative computed tomography (P-QCT; Somatom sensation 16, Simens, Erlangen, Germany). On assessment of the results, severe osteoporosis was considered because the BMD and T-score of the lumbar vertebrae (L1-4) were 40.4 mg/cm3 and -4.31 (). At the time of visiting, a plain radiograph of the left ankle showed a fracture that was not clearly depicted but showed as a faint vertical sclerotic line in the medial malleolus of the ankle joint (). She was treated with restriction of activity and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). After 3 weeks of treatment, she still had pain in the left ankle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The MRI of the left ankle revealed an irregular vertical low signal line with surrounding marrow edema at the junction of the medial malleolus and the tibial plafond which did not extend to the medial malleolar cortex of the tibia (). We diagnosed a medial malleolar insufficiency fracture of the ankle.\nAn operation was performed because of progressive pain and difficulty of ambulation during the follow-up, leading to early recovery and normal activities. The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia. The fracture was internally fixated with a percutaneous cannulated screw under c-arm guidance () and at the same time an arthroscopic procedure was performed. The arthroscopic examination revealed no displacement of the medial fracture line within the joint but synovitis was observed. Arthroscopic debridement was performed. After surgery, she was kept in a non-weight bearing cast for 5 weeks. At the fifth week, she was allowed to perform ankle range of motion exercises and partial weight-bearing walking. As of the 4-month follow-up, there was bony union and she had recovered to full activity with the treatment including osteoporosis medications ().

She did not have any other contributory past medical, surgical, social, or family history. On physical examination, she was in mild distress secondary to her myalgias. Vital signs showed a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure of 175/105 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, and pulse oxymetry at 100% on room air. Pulmonary, cardiac, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable on admission. Notably, the neurologic examination was also unremarkable on admission.\nThe patients’ initial labs revealed a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sodium of 129 mmol/L (normal range: 135-145 mmol/L), potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3.4-4.7 mmol/L), glucose of 337 mg/dL (normal range: 70-99 mg/dL), and calcium of 9.3 mg/dL (normal range: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL). Other labs showed C-reactive protein of 0.14 mg/dL, D-dimer of 0.67, creatinine kinase of 28, and hemoglobin A1C of 10.9%. The chest X-ray of the patient was unremarkable, but computed tomography (CT) of the chest did reveal ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower bilateral lung fields consistent with a COVID-19 presentation (Figure ).\nThe patient was placed on observation status secondary to her SARS-CoV-2 infection. Her hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and elevated blood pressure resolved on follow-up. On day two, the patient had a complaint of “dry eye” on the left. Examination of the face revealed asymmetric forehead folds, inability to raise the left eyebrow, and left facial droop. There was no bilateral component. The remainder of the neurologic examination was within normal limits. Therefore, a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy was made and the patient was started on empiric steroids (prednisone 20 mg daily for five days), valacyclovir (1 g TID for seven days), and doxycycline (100 mg BID). The doxycycline was discontinued once the Lyme disease titers returned negative and the patient finished her course of empiric valacyclovir and steroids.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 129.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 337.0 mg/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (337.0 - 100) = 134.688 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 134.688 mEq/L.",

The symptoms were associated with some episodes of nausea, vomiting, and loose semisolid stools. The patient reported shortness of breath that had progressed to rest over the past weeks. He denied any fever but reported some chills. He denied any chest pain, palpitations, lower extremity swelling, abdominal pain, or other complaints. The patient has routine weekly labs which showed hyponatremia (sodium = 122 mmol/dL, baseline 130 mmol/dL) so he was sent for evaluation to the emergency room by his cardiologist. The patient has a past medical history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed at age 16. A transthoracic echocardiogram done about 9 months prior showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20% and severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient had an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) placement 8 years prior for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The patient had been on a chronic milrinone infusion delivered through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for the past 3 years. This was initiated as a bridge to transplant. However, during transplant evaluation, he was noted to have secondary pulmonary hypertension and would need a combined heart and lung transplant, and no transplant center in the state would accept his insurance for a combined transplant. Besides cardiomyopathy, he also has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, congenital hydrocephalus with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (since the age of 2), and spinal stenosis. Of note, the patient was taking apixaban, bumetanide, magnesium oxide, allopurinol, digoxin, metolazone, eplerenone, and carvedilol.\nOn exam, the patient had a red, swollen left upper extremity at the site of his PICC and white nail beds on the left hand and cool extremities, but no lower extremity edema. The patient was afebrile, had an elevated heart rate of 109 beats per minute (bpm), an elevated respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and SpO2 was 96% on 2 L nasal cannula. All other vitals were within normal limits.\nLabs on admission are as follows: WBC: 10.9 × 103/mcL; sodium: 123 mmol/L; potassium: 4.7 mmol/L; chloride: 90 mmol/L; bicarbonate: 22; BUN: 27 mg/dL; creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL; glucose: 102 mg/dL; INR: 1.56; total bilirubin: 4.12 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase: 166 units/L; AST: 44 units/L; and ALT: 27 units/L. The patient was initially diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and his symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea resolved within 2 days. As the team was preparing to discharge the patient, 2 sets of blood cultures taken at admission came back positive for Candida dubliniensis. The patient's WBC count increased from 11.0 to 15.2 with continued stability in his vital signs other than an increase in his heart rate to 120 s bpm. A chest X-ray on admission showed no acute abnormalities, stable cardiomegaly, and an AICD in place. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial flutter. CT scan of the head showed a left VP shunt with mild ventriculomegaly of the lateral and third ventricles unchanged since 2017. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage was found. A lumbar puncture obtained clear CSF that was sent to microbiology. The CSF cultures had no growth. The patient was started on empiric micafungin 100 mg IV daily and vancomycin.\nA blood culture of the PICC line and a culture of the catheter tip was positive for Candida dubliniensis as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for antifungals are listed in .\nThe PICC line was removed and a right-sided internal jugular vein (IJV) central line was placed. Vancomycin was discontinued after one day once the culture grew yeast. A negative blood culture of C. dubliniensis was drawn 4 weeks after the first positive culture. Micafungin was continued for a total of 6 weeks after the initial positive culture.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) () showed a new finding of echogenicity of one of the three leads consistent with lead vegetation. Consistent with a TEE done 8 months ago, there was minimal thickening of the aortic valve, mild thickening of the mitral valve with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. One of the leads had a mobile echodensity measuring 0.4 × 1.3 cm, consistent with lead vegetation. No valvular vegetations were identified on TEE. The findings of the TEE were consistent with AICD fungal septicemia. An AICD lead extraction was done one week after admission at an outside facility with a temporary transcutaneous pacer placed, after which the patient returned to our inpatient facility for placement of a replacement AICD two weeks later. Blood cultures done at the outside facility were negative. Blood cultures from the right and left arms done at our facility after AICD implantation returned Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets sensitive to cefazolin, oxacillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The right-side IJV central line was removed and a left-side IJV central line was placed with negative blood cultures after placement. The micafungin was recommended to be continued for four weeks after new AICD placement and cefazolin was started for two weeks due to the right-sided IJV central line MSSA infection. A vascular surgeon was consulted for optimal line access with the least infectious risk. The vascular surgeon recommended a PICC line. A replacement PICC line was placed three weeks later and the patient was discharged the next day with a PICC line for milrinone, cefazolin, and micafungin infusion. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-1.05",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.95",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 123.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 123.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 123.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 123.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 123.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 123.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 90.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 90.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 123.0 mEq/L - (90.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 11.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 11.0 - 12 = -1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -1.0 mEq/L.",

His wife called an ambulance and had him brought to our ED as she noticed he was short of breath for the prior 12 hours. He did not have any symptoms suggestive of a recent upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis. He denied exposure to sick contacts, recent immunizations, or consumption of canned foods or beverages. He did have a past medical history significant for esophageal stricture (diagnosed 2 years before) for which he had been undergoing routine endoscopic balloon dilation (last attempt was 3 months before). He lived in a rural upstate New York county and had retired as a meat-cutter 15 years before. His only medications at the time were ferrous sulfate (324 mg daily), pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), and a multivitamin. He did not have a history of tobacco smoking. He consumed approximately two standard drinks in a week. He had no known allergies. While in our ED, his vital signs were: temperature, 37 ºC (98.6 ºF); heart rate, 100–110 beats per minute; blood pressure, 141/82 mmHg; and oxygen saturation 82% on room air and requiring 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) via facemask to maintain saturations above 96%. On physical examination, he was in marked respiratory distress but not toxic-appearing. He was awake but drowsy, oriented only to self. His pupils were equal and symmetrical with appropriate response to light. His extra-ocular movements were intact. There was no facial droop; there was no deviation of tongue or uvula. His gag reflex was impaired. He could move all four extremities spontaneously and on command. However, motor strength appeared to be symmetrically and mildly diminished in all extremities and accompanied by decreased tone. Diminished knee and ankle reflexes were noted bilaterally. He had a diminished flexor plantar response bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact in his face, trunk, and extremities. Coordination was impaired in upper and lower extremities with dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was not assessed. He had no visible involuntary movements. His neck was supple without signs of meningismus. A cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and equal symmetrical pulses in bilateral extremities. His abdominal, musculoskeletal, and skin examinations were unremarkable. Although he was hemodynamically stable, he became lethargic with stridor and progressive hypoxia. Given concern for airway protection, he was emergently intubated with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube on first attempt and placed on mechanical ventilatory support. For intubation, he was administered 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine and 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate intravenously. Maintenance fluids (normal saline at 125 cc/hour) and empiric intravenous administration of ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g every 24 hours (to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia) was initiated. He was transferred to our intensive care unit for further management. A nasopharyngolaryngoscopy revealed bilateral true vocal cord paralysis. After stabilization on a ventilator, he underwent a tracheostomy on day 3 of admission and was transitioned successfully to a tracheostomy collar. Following extubation, he had consistent and gradual recovery of mental status. This was not, however, accompanied by any progressive improvement in motor function. He continued to have vocal cord immobility and flaccid weakness of his extremities.\nOn presentation, laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,800 cells/μL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dl; platelet count, 235,000 cells/μL; sodium, of 143 mmol/L; potassium, 4.2 mmol/L; chloride, 105 mmol/L; glucose, 176 mg/dL; bicarbonate, 27 mmol/L; creatinine, 0.53 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 15 mg/dL; and calcium, 8.0 mg/dL. A hepatic function panel revealed a total protein level, 5.2 g/dL; serum albumin, 3.5 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 18 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 21 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.08; creatine kinase, 127 U/L; and troponin I less than 0.015 ng/mL. Urine analysis demonstrated cloudy urine with specific gravity 1.018, pH 4.8, with 116 red blood cells (RBCs) and 4 white blood cells (WBCs), negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable. A urine drug screen and serum alcohol levels were negative. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cortisol levels were within normal limits. Thiamine, vitamin B6, and B12 levels were normal. Serological tests were negative for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Blood and urine cultures obtained at presentation showed no growth. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of his head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain were normal except for mild ventriculomegaly (Fig. ). CT angiography of his head and neck revealed patent intracranial vasculature. A repetitive nerve stimulation electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated patchy, moderate to severe, peripheral motor nerve denervation consistent with AIDP. A lumbar puncture was performed and analysis of the obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed albuminocytologic dissociation with less than 3 nucleated cells per mL of fluid, elevated CSF protein of 62 mg/dl, and normal glucose levels (88 mg/dl). CSF cultures did not demonstrate any growth. Anti-GQ1B antibody and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels were negative.\nA subacute presentation with ataxia, stridor with respiratory distress, and areflexia with weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremity offers a challenging differential (Table ).\nIt is prudent to first rule out an acute vascular cause such as stroke, especially involving the cerebellum and brainstem; for example, for example, an absence of any lateralizing neurological signs and disturbed consciousness would rule out stroke, especially one with brainstem involvement. Next, metabolic abnormalities due to alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, or electrolyte deficiencies would be evident on a metabolic panel and on serum vitamin and ethyl alcohol levels. An absence of a suggestive history of exposure to Clostridium botulinum, such as consumption of canned or tinned foods, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin injection, or intravenous drug use, significantly lowers the possibility of botulism. An absence of fever and meningeal signs, and analysis of CSF obtained on lumbar puncture, can rule out meningitis and encephalitis. Spinal cord trauma and spinal shock in the initial stages would result in flaccid paralysis of extremities aside from obvious signs of trauma. Also, concomitant bulbar paralysis is highly unlikely. Overlapping autoimmune demyelinating syndromes such as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis (BBE) must be considered. GBS is more likely to have a characteristic pattern of ascending paralysis. BBE is considered to lie on the same spectrum as MFS as it may present with ataxia and ophthalmoplegia and can have positive anti-GQ1b antibodies. However, BBE is characterized more by hyperreflexia and somnolence. New-onset MG can be suspected but, in our patient, motor involvement was patchy, the anti-AChR antibody test result was negative, and EMG was not suggestive of MG.\nBased on the above, a diagnosis of MFS involving the bulbar muscles was made and our patient was started on a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin at a daily dose of 0.4 mg/kg body weight per day. Following completion of this course, he showed clinical improvement in phonation, overall muscle strength, as well as tone. Although he initially did require overnight ventilatory support through his tracheostomy, the need for this gradually diminished and he was weaned off the ventilator altogether.\nSubsequent follow-up laryngoscopies after 1, 2, and 4 weeks showed improvement in vocal cord abduction. His overall respiratory status also improved with decreasing oxygen requirement and decreased need for tracheostomy suctioning. He continued to have moderate pharyngeal dysphagia and required placement of a jejunostomy tube for feeding. His hospitalization was also complicated with development of aspiration pneumonia. He was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility on a tracheostomy collar and jejunostomy tube after a total of 6 weeks of hospitalization and subsequently discharged home after making suitable progress in physical rehabilitation. He continued to follow-up with the physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) out-patient clinic and remained tracheostomy-dependent at 6 months following hospitalization. He was able to ambulate with a walker at that time. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "286.078",
    "Upper Limit": "316.192",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 143.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 15.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 176.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 143.0 + (15.0 / 2.8) + (15.0 / 18) = 301.135 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 301.135 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 57-year-old male with a known past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx T2N0 on radiation therapy, chronic alcohol abuse, ulcerative colitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to the emergency department with 3 episodes of syncope and decreased oral intake over the week prior to presentation. He also reported difficulty swallowing solid foods over the past month. His last alcohol intake was 2 days prior to admission. On initial evaluation, vitals were significant for heart rate of 122 beats/min, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20/min, and temperature of 37°C. Physical examination revealed a dry oral mucosa and decreased skin turgor. Laboratory studies were remarkable for sodium level of 126 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 86 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28 mEq/L, BUN of 33 mg/dL, and creatinine of 4.2 mEq/L with a baseline of 0.6 mEq/L, platelets of 124,000/mm3, AST of 83 IU/L, ALT of 62 IU/L, ALP of 129 IU/L, and bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Ammonia and albumin levels were noted to be within the normal range. Initial computerized tomography (CT) of the head was negative for acute intracranial process. The patient was started on IV fluids and admitted for further management.\nOver the next few days, the patient's hydration status improved and his appetite increased. His creatinine trended down and his sodium level increased to 130 mEq/L. On fourth day of admission, the patient was noted to be combative towards the medical staff. He also started showing signs of alcohol withdrawal with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremors, anxiety, and confusion. Examination revealed progressively worsening abdominal distention. Sodium levels rose steadily to 140 mEq/L over the next four days. On the eighth day of admission, intravenous (IV) fluids were changed to D5W in light of the increasing sodium level. A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained for the increasing abdominal distention, which revealed dilatation of the small bowel (see ) extending from the proximal jejunum to the distal ileum as well as marked dilatation of the cecum extending to the proximal descending colon, suggestive of adynamic ileus. Cirrhosis of the liver and recto sigmoid diverticula were also noted. A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed and put to wall suction. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed but the scope had to be withdrawn prematurely due to the risk of perforation of diverticuli. He continued to be agitated and confused, requiring frequent doses of lorazepam to control his symptoms. On days 9 and 10, patient's sodium level increased steeply from 142 mEq/L to 151 and 159 mEq/L, respectively. On day 12, the patient had decreased response to verbal and physical stimuli. It was noted at this time that the patient was no longer on lorazepam. Ongoing free water losses from diarrhea, NG suction, and extensive third spacing into the bowel delayed the rapid reversal of hypernatremia despite aggressive IV fluid hydration. He became increasingly lethargic and developed worsening dysarthria and dysphagia. Neurological exam revealed disconjugate gaze with exotropia, flaccid quadriparesis, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (see Figures and ) demonstrated increased T2 and flair signals in the central basis pontis consistent with central pontine myelinolysis.\nOn the 13th day of the hospital course, the patient started developing respiratory distress with tachypnea into the 30 s; examination revealed rapid shallow breathing and use of accessory muscles. CT scan of the chest showed significant debris in the right main stem bronchus along with collapse of the right lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonitis (see ).

The patient also reported the presence of low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss of 24 pounds, and decreased appetite for 3 months. During the period of subacute symptoms, the patient presented to the health-care system several times. The patient denied the presence of any night sweats, chills, skin rash, viral symptoms, or hemoptysis. Past medical history was positive for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, whereas the patient had surgical history of mitral valve replacement due to severe mitral valve regurgitation, coronary artery bypass grafting, carotid endarterectomy, aortic valve repair, and placement of a surgical mesh after urinary bladder surgery. Medications at the time of admission included warfarin, amiodarone, and metoprolol. The patient was vitally stable; however, physical examination revealed a 4/6 diastolic murmur on the apical area along with significant tenderness on the left upper chest wall which radiated toward the back. The patient. had no Janeway lesions and had no exposure to tame animals.\nBlood workup showed pancytopenia and elevated creatinine of 5.9 mg/L, potassium of 6.1 mEq/L, C-reactive protein of 61 mg/dL, and International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 4.78. Urine analysis showed hematuria with mild proteinuria and mixed cellular cast. Light microscopic study of urine, liver function tests, serology for viral hepatitis, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and cryoglobulin were within the normal range. Bacterial isolates were recovered from four of four blood cultures within 14–28 h of collection using the standard automated instrumentation (BacT-Alert System, FA Plus and FN Plus bottles, BioMeriuex, Durham, NC, USA). Following subculture to sheep blood agar, isolated colonies of Gram-positive cocci were evaluated in duplicate from each of the four cultures using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Vitek MS, BioMeriuex), with all giving uniformly high probability scores (99.9%) for the identity of E. durans.[] Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on a representative isolate from each bacteremia episode using an automated phenotypic method (Vitek 2, GP75, BioMeriuex) or standard disc diffusion and gradient diffusion (E-test, BioMeriuex) []. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed vegetation of 0.8 cm × 0.3 cm on the medial aspect of the annulus of the mechanical mitral valve []. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed splenomegaly with splenic infarction. After the initial assessment, the patient was admitted to the medicine ward, and multidisciplinary teams, including nephrology, infectious disease, radiology, and cardiac surgery, were consulted.\nAt admission, the patient was placed on intravenous fluids as conservative management for kidney injury and empiric antibiotic therapy consisting of daptomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated, whereas warfarin was halted due to supra-therapeutic INR levels. Daptomycin was eventually switched to combination ampicillin and ciprofloxacin when blood cultures revealed E. durans sensitive to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin. Gentamicin was avoided due to kidney injury. Blood cultures after 72 h of antibiotics therapy were sterile. The patient improved significantly, and on the 10th day of hospitalization, the patient was discharged home with the recommendation to complete a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics. Meanwhile, warfarin was resumed as INR stabilized at 2.33 mg/dL. In the 5th week of therapy, the patient developed peripheral eosinophilia; therefore, ampicillin was switched to daptomycin.\nThree months after the completion of antibiotic therapy, the patient presented to the emergency department with hemiplegia, left-sided facial palsy, and aphasia. Laboratory studies showed creatinine of 7.27 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 79, and INR of 7.2. CT scan of the brain showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subarachnoid extension and a 3-mm leftward midline shift. Repeated CT scan showed a progression of hemorrhage; therefore, the patient underwent right decompressive craniotomy. Four sets of blood cultures were drawn and through above-mentioned modality, they were positive for E. durans []. Transesophageal echocardiography was negative for any vegetation []. Combination antibiotic therapy was initiated, and follow-up blood culture after 48 h was sterile. The patient remained intubated and underwent continuous renal replacement therapy. Despite the definitive management, the patient developed multiple organ failure. A discussion with the family was arranged where they decided to move patient to the inpatient hospice for comfort measures where she eventually died on the 26th day of admission. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 56 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 7.27 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (7.27/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**56 * 1.012 = 6.116. Hence, the GFR value is 6.116 ml/min/1.73 m².",

She was presumed to have gastroenteritis and was prescribed oral rehydration solution at a pediatrician’s office. Subsequently, she vomited six more times, and in two episodes the vomitus contained spherical, green, gelatinous toys that were about 3 mm in size. No choking or swallowing of the toys was witnessed. However, the girl’s mother believed that they were water beads and that some likely remained in the girl’s body given the disappearance of several beads at home.\nThe initial vital signs at the emergency department included blood pressure 90/70 mmHg, heart rate 140 beats/min, respiratory rate 32 breaths/min, and temperature 37.0°C. Her weight and height were 11.0 kg (90th to 95th percentile) and 75.3 cm (50th to 75th percentile), respectively. She had a stable and mildly anxious appearance without respiratory distress or dehydration. The abdomen was soft, non-distended, and non-tender without a palpable mass.\nNo intestinal obstruction or radiopaque foreign bodies were found on a plain abdominal radiograph (). However, considering the mother’s concern for residual foreign bodies, abdominal POCUS was performed using an HM70A ultrasound system (Samsung Medison, Seongnam, South Korea) to detect water beads. A 7-MHz curvilinear transducer was placed midline on the epigastrium with the patient supine and the indicator on her right side.\nPOCUS showed the stomach as a fluid-filled sac, indicating gastric distention due to distal intestinal obstruction or retention of rehydration solution. Moreover, seven well-demarcated, round hypoechoic items approximately 10 to 15 mm in diameter were observed in the stomach and a similar, 20 mm item in the first portion of the duodenum (, ). No other foreign bodies, masses, dilated loops of bowel, or other signs of obstruction, such as intussusception, were observed on the examination. The POCUS findings indicated duodenal obstruction by ingested water beads. Of note, this examination was completed within several minutes without sedation, use of a linear transducer, or application of extra pressure on the abdomen.\nSubsequently, a pediatric gastroenterologist was able to retrieve the water beads endoscopically (). A total of 11 water beads were removed from the stomach using a retrieval net. The bead in the duodenum was first broken down by endoscopic crushing.

He had stage 4 chronic kidney disease due to nephrosclerosis, renal anemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and sleep apnea syndrome. He had been taking the following medications: amlodipine 10 mg/day, rosuvastatin 2.5 mg/day, and febuxostat 20 mg/day. He drank alcohol occasionally and had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years when he quit 15 years ago. He did not have any food or drug allergies. His family and social histories were not remarkable. His environmental history revealed no abnormalities. He was a retired company director. From January 2015, he experienced persistent early morning hypoglycemia (< 50 mg/dl) with daytime hyperglycemia. Despite reduction of BIAsp 30 dosage, early morning hypoglycemia concomitant with disturbance of consciousness continued to occur. Therefore, he was admitted to our hospital in February 2015.\nOn examination, the patient’s temperature was 36.3 °C, pulse 64 beats/min, blood pressure 126/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to time and place on admission. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, normal limb power and sensation, and absence of cerebellar signs. No changes in sensorium or psychotic features were noted. Other physical examinations revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory findings on admission were as follows: fasting plasma glucose, 82 mg/dl; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 7.0%; and glycoalbumin, 21.4%. More laboratory test results are shown in Table . Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, showed no significant change.\nAlthough BIAsp 30 was discontinued after admission, early morning hypoglycemia with daytime hyperglycemia continued even after eating small frequent meals (a four or six meals per day eating pattern). Fasting blood samples revealed a plasma glucose level of 28 mg/dl, immunoreactive insulin > 2000 μIU/ml, C-peptide 3.03 ng/ml, and high titers of insulin antibody (IA) (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate was at a high level (86.3%). Scatchard analysis showed an affinity contact (K1) of 0.00256 × 108 M− 1 and a binding capacity (B1) of 99.7 × 10− 8 M against human insulin for the high-affinity sites, indicating that the patient’s IA bound to insulin with low affinity and high binding capacity. He had no history of medication involving SH residues or supplements containing α-lipoic acid. Moreover, workup for endocrinological abnormality and autoimmune disease did not reveal any significant findings (Table ). HLA-DRB1*04:06 was undetectable, and imaging studies of the head and abdomen showed no evidence of abnormalities.\nThe patient’s serum creatinine level was 2.17 mg/dl, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 23.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. His arterial pH at 5:00 a.m. was 7.277, bicarbonate was 15.1 mEq/L, and base excess was − 10.7. After he was given a gradually increasing dose up to 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (split four times per day) for the purpose of correcting metabolic acidosis, his early morning glucose level was improved, concurrently bringing pH up to 7.4 (Fig. ). Early morning hypoglycemia disappeared after he took 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate and three meals plus snacks at night daily (1400 kcal/day) without any oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. The patient was discharged in late March 2015 and continued on the same treatment.\nAfter 9 months of follow-up with these treatments, the patient’s plasma glucose level at 5:00 a.m. was 96 mg/dl, and his arterial pH was 7.376. His immunoreactive insulin level had significantly decreased to 11.4 μIU/ml, even though the titer of IA remained high (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate decreased to 42.1%. According to the Scatchard analysis, his IA shifted to higher affinity (K1 = 0.142 × 108 M− 1) and lower capacity (B1 = 0.969 × 10− 8 M) than his previous IA.

Physical examination on admission revealed a height of 156 cm, weight of 49 kg, temperature of 40.2°C, heart rate of 120 beats/min, and blood pressure of 116/62 mmHg. No obvious abnormalities of the chest or abdomen were found with the exception of slight right flank pain. Neurological examination also showed normal findings; her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was maximal at 15 (E4V5M6). She was ambulatory; no symptoms suggesting agnosia, agraphia, or any other higher brain dysfunction were observed on admission. In addition, finger perimetry showed no obvious visual field deficits. Laboratory findings showed a high WBC count (20,200/mm3), platelet count (40.4 × 104/mm3), and CRP level (10.02 mg/dl). Chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray, and electrocardiographic findings were normal. Urinalysis revealed pyuria with markedly increased WBCs and gram-negative bacilli, suggesting a urinary tract infection. Intravenous administration of ampicillin (6 g/day) was begun immediately after admission. On day 4, her body temperature remained higher than 38°C despite improvement in the WBC count (18,300/mm3) and CRP level (3.91 mg/dl). On the same day, E. coli was revealed in urine and blood culture specimens taken on admission. Although the E. coli was sensitive to ampicillin, we substituted ceftriaxone (2 g/day) for ampicillin on day 4 based on the results of the antibiotic sensitivity test.\nOn day 5, her body temperature dropped to 37.5°C. However, she began to drop her spoon frequently during meals and complain of difficulty in donning her shirt. On day 6, she complained of difficulty in seeing. Although she did not exhibit severe palsy or ataxia, she could no longer eat a meal, change her clothes, or walk by herself without nursing care. She was considerably confused, and it was difficult to evaluate her neurological function precisely. Her level of consciousness sharply deteriorated thereafter, and her GCS score dropped to 9 (E2V3M4). Her WBC count and CRP level on day 6 were 15,600/mm3 and 3.63 mg/dl, respectively. Electrolyte, thyroid hormone, and blood glucose levels were normal. Plain brain CT on day 6 showed debris in the right lateral ventricle and a tumor-like lesion in the left posterior lobe (Figure A). Contrast-enhanced MRI on day 6 revealed a tumor-like lesion in the left posterior lobe with ring-like enhancement on T1-weighted imaging (Figure B). On diffusion-weighted imaging, this lesion also showed homogenous high intensity, which seemed to be connected with the left lateral ventricle, and obvious debris was present in both lateral ventriculi (Figure C). Based on these findings, we considered that ventricular rupture of a brain abscess was the most probable cause of her deterioration. The size of the abscess was 1.6 × 1.8 cm. Subsequent abdominal contrast-enhanced CT on day 6 showed a unilocular right renal cyst with heterogeneous and high-density content, suggesting a renal cyst infection (Figure A). Abdominal ultrasonographic findings were inconclusive for a cyst infection. Contrast-enhanced chest CT showed no remarkable findings. Further laboratory and transthoracic echocardiographic diagnostics excluded potential risk factors for brain abscess, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, fungal infection, endocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension. We immediately consulted with neurosurgeons and decided to manage the right occipital lesion with intravenous meropenem administration (6 g/day). Her consciousness gradually improved thereafter; her GCS score recovered to 12 (E3V4M5) on day 9. She was slightly confused and showed impaired orientation, but her ability to converse with us had improved. Brain MRI on day 9 revealed no remarkable changes in the size of the abscess. No signs of high intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus were present either clinically or radiographically. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on day 9 revealed a slight increase in leukocytes (64/mm3), including 23/mm3 (36%) lymphocytes and 41/mm3 (64%) neutrophils with no atypical cells, as well as high total protein (517 mg/dl) and low glucose (21 mg/dl) levels. Microscopy of CSF smear samples with methylene blue staining, India ink capsule staining, and Gram’s staining detected no bacteria or fungi. The CSF culture was sterile. On day 12, her body temperature remained below 37.5°C, but her WBC count (14,900/mm3) and CRP level (4.01 mg/dl) remained high. Additionally, her right flank pain persisted despite antibiotic therapy. MRI on day 12 showed no deterioration of the brain abscess. Based on these findings, we concluded that CT-guided drainage was needed to manage the renal cyst infection. The drainage procedure was performed on day 13, and E. coli from the aspirated pus showed the same sensitivity to antibiotics as did the E. coli from the blood and urine on admission. The patient showed good progress thereafter. The drainage catheter was removed on day 20. Her GCS score recovered to 15 on day 22. On day 30, she showed almost normal activities of daily life, although she still experienced difficulty in seeing. Her WBC count and CRP level normalized, and enhanced brain MRI showed a dramatic decrease in the abscess size (Figure D). Moreover, abdominal enhanced CT on day 35 showed that the right renal cyst had decreased in size (Figure B). Formal perimetry was performed by an ophthalmologist on day 35 and showed obvious right inferior quadrantic hemianopsia. Moreover, transesophageal echocardiography using contrast medium on day 35 showed no cryptic abnormalities, including intracardiac right-to-left shunting or small vegetations. Intravenous administration of meropenem was terminated on day 42, and no deterioration was observed even in the absence of oral antibiotics. Following rehabilitation, she was discharged from the hospital on day 60 with right inferior quadrantic hemianopsia as an aftereffect. She has been followed up for 6 months since discharge, and no recurrence of the brain abscess or renal cyst infection has been observed. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is not reported to be the #1 diagnosis and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. The patient's heart rate is 120.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 1.5. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 1.5. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 1.5. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 1.5.

The diagnosis of CDH was made prenatally, and 46, XY, der(21)t(1;21)(q42.3;q22.2) was diagnosed via examination using the amniotic fluid. Fetal ultrasonic testing showed a lung thorax transverse area (LT) ratio of 0.10. He was born at full term, 38 weeks and 2 days, through vaginal delivery in the delivery room. The birth weight was 2105 g. After birth, intubation (uncuffed endotracheal tube, 3.5 mm, Smiths Medical, USA) was performed immediately. After admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the piston HFOV (calliope-alpha, Metran, Japan) was started as the initial ventilation. At the initial settings, the MAP was 14 cmH2O, the stroke volume (SV) 20 ml, and the frequency 12 Hz. Inhaled nitric monoxide (iNO) was used at 20 ppm because of the persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (Fig. ). Fourteen hours after birth, PPHN increased and Lipo-prostaglandin E1 (Lipo-PGE1) was administered to keep the arterial duct open and maintain blood flow to the pulmonary artery. After administration of Lipo-PGE1, the level of saturation was increased both pre-ductally and post-ductally, and the saturation was kept around 95% for the next 30 h. The level of saturation decreased, and the dissociation of pre-ductal and post-ductal saturation re-occurred 44 h after birth. Increasing the iNO concentration and MAP was ineffective. Blood gas analysis revealed an alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2) of 500 Torr, and oxygenation index (OI) of 20. The PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio was 58.8 (Fig. a–c), which required considering the introduction of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to save the patient’s life. Before introducing the ECMO, we inspected the pulmonary function tests results. The static pulmonary function was measured by occlusion method using ARFEL III (Aivision, Japan), which adapted a Fleischer type of pneumotachograph. Because under HFOV, pulmonary function tests cannot be performed accurately, we changed ventilator mode from HFOV to CMV, and used muscle relaxant to rule out the effects of spontaneous breathing just before running the test. The occlusion valve operation was measured with 4–5 breaths to confirm reproducibility. The respiratory-system compliance (Crs) level was 0.29 ml/cmH2O/kg and the respiratory-system resistance (Rrs) level was 515 cmH2O·kg/L/s. Because the Rrs level was elevated, we made the decision to shift the ventilator mode from HFOV to CMV at the ventilator settings of PIP 20 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and ventilator rate of 40/min. After switching to CMV, the patient’s heart rate rose from 159 bpm to 169 bpm, and saturation rose from 89 to 96% immediately. Thirty minutes after switching to CMV, blood gas tests revealed that the AaDO2 dropped to 275 and the OI to 7.3, while the P/F ratio increased (Fig. a–c). At 55 h after birth, the operation for repairing the diaphragm was performed. The patient was then discharged from our hospital at 1 month of age with an uneventful course of treatment. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Regarding his history, the patient was delivered at the 39th gestational week of a 23-year-old mother by cesarean section due to the failure of progression, weighing 2.4 kg, and was reported to have developed respiratory distress upon birth. Regarding the mother, she is medically free and was on multivitamins while there were no reports of any radiation or teratogenic exposure that was reported during her pregnancy. After birth, the patient was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for six months due to his abnormal respiration. There is no family history of any genetic disorders, consanguinity, or congenital anomalies.\nInitially, the patient was suffering from developmental delay and extensor muscle weakness of the upper and lower limbs. Moreover, an epiglottopexy procedure was performed due to choanal atresia and a high arched palate. Afterward, he was breathing on room air through a nasal cannula. Ever since the epiglottopexy, the patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with no attempt to wean him off the ventilation due to poor response. Even though the patient did not present any gastrointestinal abnormalities, there was a difficulty in feeding, which led to nasogastric tube insertion for oral nutrition and supplementation. The patient also developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was confirmed by testing; an abnormal facial shape, which was a dysmorphic triangular face; coloboma; and bilateral low-set ears. A shallow acetabular roof, micropenis, small bilateral kidney, high arched palate, and hypo-plastic left thumb was also noted (Figure ). Regarding the cardiovascular system, the patient had a moderate to large ventricular septal defect (VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, and mild pulmonary stenosis.

However, his gastrointestinal system showed no abnormalities.\nRegarding the investigation, his blood work was within normal limits except for a low serum creatinine of 13 µmol/L (normal range: 71-133 µmol/L) and hyponatremia of 130 mEq/L. Meanwhile, his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild periventricular leukomalacia, benign external hydrocephalus, with the suggestion of Blake's pouch cyst (Figure ). The genetic investigation was performed for the patient, and he was found to have chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), c.2572C˃T p(Arg858), and the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome was confirmed based on the physical examination and the gene sequencing report. The patient is in hospital and is followed up by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiologist, neurologist, nephrologist, general pediatrician, gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, and physiotherapist with a plan to try and increase and improve his life expectancy and quality of life moving forward. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L. </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "-0.108",
    "Upper Limit": "-0.0978",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L. The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. This means that the patient is 1 year and 3 oldThe patient's is a Male. The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6. The patient's weight is 2.4 kg. The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 2.4 * (130.0/140 - 1) = -0.103 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.103 L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 55-year-old, 167 cm, 70 kg male suffering from alcoholic end-stage liver cirrhosis with a 'model for end stage liver disease' score of 15 points, and Child-Pugh class C, was scheduled for deceased-donor liver transplantation. He had a history of hepatic encephalopathy, refractory ascites, and undergoing a repetitive paracentesis over the previous 6 months. When he first arrived at our hospital 3 months earlier, he had suffered from hepatic hydrothorax, which waxed and waned. Pleural fluid analysis revealed transudative fluid. The preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (46 mmHg) without coexisting cardiopulmonary disease. The preoperative chest computed tomography showed massive pleural effusion and related passive atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobe (). On the day of surgery, he was in mild respiratory distress and a plain chest radiograph revealed massive pleural effusion of the right lung and associated lung collapse (). An 8.5-French percutaneous pigtail catheter was placed in the right pleural space 3 h before surgery and 600 ml of transudative pleural fluid were drained naturally.\nAnesthesia was induced with fentanyl (100 µg), midazolam (3 mg), thiopental sodium (250 mg), and rocuronium (40 mg). Anesthesia was maintained with a 50% oxygen/air mixture and sevoflurane. Neuromuscular block was maintained with cisatracurium. Hemodynamic monitoring included the right radial and femoral arterial, central venous, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and cardiac output measurements (Vigilance monitoring, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) using pulmonary artery catheter (CCOmbo V; 7.5 French, Edwards Lifesciences).\nThe prehepatic and anhepatic phase was uneventful and during that period, 500 ml of transudate were drained through the pigtail catheter. After reperfusion of a graft, he required a bolus of epinephrine (10 µg), dobutamine infusion (5-10 µg/kg/min) and norepinephrine infusion (0.05-0.1 µg/kg/min) to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. At this time, his ventilation was well controlled and the results of arterial blood gas analysis were unremarkable, as shown in . However, 30 min after reperfusion, we found a straw-colored fluid emanating from the ET tube. The trachea was intermittently suctioned and total volume suctioned via ET tube was over 500 ml in 30 min. The characteristics of the regurgitated fluid were similar to those of fluid drained through the pigtail catheter, which decreased visibly at that time. Hypoxemia did not occur with a FIO2 of 0.5, as indicated by the stable SpO2 during the entire intraoperative period. Thus, we suspected the presence of a connection between the airway and pleural space on the affected side and that the pleural fluid on the right side was regurgitated towards the ET tube. We changed a standard ET tube to a 37-French double-lumen tube (DLT; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) to provide differential lung ventilation. A regurgitated fluid was obtained continuously from the right bronchus, but not from the left bronchus. After a discussion with the operating surgeons and a thoracic surgeon, we decided to open the diaphragm to check for the presence of APF. Air leakage via a 1.0 cm defect on the right lung surface during positive-pressure ventilation was detected through a 1.5 cm incision of the right side of the diaphragm ( and ). The APF and incised diaphragm was repaired with a suture with a minimal residual APF. The remaining surgical procedure was otherwise uneventful. At the end of surgery, the chest tube was inserted in the right pleural cavity. During the 550-min anesthesia, 7,400 ml of crystalloid, 200 ml of 20% albumin, 12 units of leukocyte depleted red blood cell, and 10 units of fresh frozen plasma were infused. Urine output was 880 ml and the estimated blood loss was about 10,000 ml.\nFollowing the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with the placement of a DLT. An immediate postoperative chest radiograph suggested a decreased pleural effusion and mild bilateral pulmonary edema (). As the amount of regurgitated fluid decreased, the DLT was replaced with a standard ET tube on the day after the operation. On the second postoperative day, pneumothorax developed on the right side (), which resolved 2 days later. The ET tube was removed on the fourth postoperative day. In total, 500-1,000 ml of drainage were obtained daily via the chest tube during 2 weeks with ongoing ascites. Drainage decreased slowly thereafter, and the chest tube was removed on postoperative day 21 (). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "problem": "<Context> A 51-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with massive hematochezia, hypotension, and abdominal pain. The patient reported intermittent hematochezia for 3 days. His medical history was remarkable for hypertension only. There was no history of radiation therapy or recent abdominal surgery.\nOn initial clinical observation, the patient was hemodynamically unstable. The systolic blood pressure was 90 mmHg, heart rate was 110/min, and temperature was 36.8 °C. His abdomen was soft and flat, but there was tenderness in the left upper quadrant. Because initial hemoglobin value in the emergency room was 7.3 g/dl (normal range, 13.5–17), immediate transfusion and emergency endoscopy were performed to identify bleeding sites and perform hemostasis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no upper gastrointestinal pathology to account for bleeding, and colonoscopy revealed hematic residues but no detected lesion (Fig. ). As soon as endoscopy was completed, abdominal pelvic computed tomography (AP-CT) scan was performed with IV contrast. AP-CT scan showed that the distal jejunum and its mesentery were tortuous and the end of the mesentery was ring-shaped suggesting an intra-abdominal intussusception (Fig. ).\nBecause of unresponsive transfusion for low blood pressure and continuous hematochezia, an emergency laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative laparoscopic findings showed typical intussusception in which one small bowel infiltrated the other small bowel (Fig. ).\nGross and histopathologic examination after resection confirmed GIST to be the leading point causative of the intussusception. Grossly, the mass was within the small bowel wall, covered with epithelial mucosa, and measuring 3.7 × 2.5 × 2.5 cm. A centrally located and depressed ulcerative lesion was identified overlying the tumor (Fig. ). On cut section, a relatively well-demarcated, firm and fibrotic, and light gray, lobulated mass was identified. The mass involved the entire small bowel wall, extending from the mucosa to the subserosa without penetrating the serosal surface. Overall, monotonous and multifocal hemorrhagic foci were identified, with no dominant focus of bleeding (Fig. ).\nOn light microscopic examination, hypercellular and hypocellular areas were identified with mostly hypercellular component showing nodular appearance under low magnification. Under high magnification, spindle cells showed elongated nuclei with vesicular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli forming short fascicles (Fig. ). The ulcerative area showed neutrophilic inflammatory exudate and extravasated erythrocytes, confirming heavy bleeding within the ulcerative focus.\nImmunohistochemically, the tumor was strongly positive for c-kit (CD117), showing diffuse and cytoplasmic reactivity (Fig. ). DOG1 (also known as ANO1, anoctamin 1) stain was also positive in our case, which is sensitive and relatively specific for GIST, confirming the diagnosis. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are not reported and so we assume that this is missing from the patient, keeping the current total at 0. Whether Pulmonary Embolism is the #1 diagonsis or is equally likely to being the #1 diagnosis is not reported and so we assume this statement is false, keeping the total unchanged at 0. The patient's heart rate is 110.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is more than 100 bpm, and so the score is increased by 1.5, making the total score, 0 + 1.5 = 1.5. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 1.5. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 1.5. Hemoptysis is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 1.5.

    "problem": "<Context> A 67-year-old man with a height of 183 cm and a weight of 105 kg was admitted for urgent resection of a left atrial mass. He presented with progressive heart failure that could not be alleviated by inotropic or vasodilating drugs and had been coughing for 10 days. The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.\nOn physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.\nThe preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54×27 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.\nAccording to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.\nIn the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%–93% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack–Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen® (sufentanil) 1 μg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60° Semi-Fowler’s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28–30 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%–93% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%–95%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 μg/h and sevoflurane 2%–2.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient’s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.\nAfter median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%–100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25°C and 28°C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .\nUnder direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15×2 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min and dopamine 5 μg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%–95%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was −2,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in .\nAfter CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min, dopamine 5 μg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid–base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%–97% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 105.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mEq/L.

The following initial settings were used: blood-pump\n150mL/min, dialysate (Prismasol 4®) 1000mL/hr, pre-filter\nreplacement solution (Prismasol 4®) 500mL/hr, post-filter\nreplacement solution (Prismasol 4®) 500mL/hr and fluid removal\n50mL/hr. During the first two days of therapy, the main problem with\nhemodiafiltration was easy coagulability of the hemofilter due to high levels of\nmyoglobin in circulation. To overcome this problem, higher pre-dilution flow rates\nwere used (maximum 1500mL/h). After 48 hours, she had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia\nof 2.7mg/dL that was corrected after adding phosphorous to the replacement\nsolutions. On day 5, intermittent hemodialysis was started, and three sessions on\nalternate days were performed. A calcium antagonist was prescribed on day six due to\nworsening hypertension.\nSigns and symptoms were controlled with medical treatment and renal replacement\ntherapy. Creatinine kinase and myoglobin returned to normal values in two weeks. Her\ndiuresis started to recover after the second day of therapy. At discharge, her renal\nfunction was recovering, and she had a glomerular filtration rate of\n88.9mL/min/1.73m2.\nRegarding the investigation of the underlying insult, an acylcarnitine analysis by\ntandem mass spectrometry of the patient's dried blood spot revealed a deficiency of\nvery long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). A genetic study revealed the\nfollowing mutations in compound heterozygosity of the VLCAD gene: p.P65Tfs*7 (c.\n187_192insA) and p.R336H (c.1097G > A).\nFrequent meals with carbohydrate-rich intake before exercise and restriction of\nlong-chain fatty acids intake along with medium-chain fatty acid supplementation\nwere recommended to prevent further attacks. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

The cat was depressed and indifferent and had convulsions after few minutes (). Cat was washed with a mild detergent and two endovenous catheters were placed at both cephalic veins. Micro-Hct and total protein were evaluated (). Ringer lactate solution infusion was started at 3 times the maintenance dose (6 ml/kg/h) for maintaining hydration and promote diuresis. Due to the severity of tremors, a single IV bolus of propofol (Proposure 10 mg/ml solution, Merial Italia, Milano- Italy) was given at 1 mg/kg. Then DXMDT (Dexdomitor 0.5 mg/ml solution for dogs and cats. Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland) was administered IV at 1 µg/kg. After administration cat was quieter and tremors were reduced. Oxygen was given via face mask and it was well tolerated. ILE (Intralipid 20% IV Fat Emulsion, Fresenius Kabi, Canada) bolus was administered using the second venous access at 2 ml/kg in 3 minutes, followed by a constant rate infusion at 4 ml/kg/h for one hour. After the first hour the cat was reassessed and, because of persisting twitching, ILE infusion continued again for 2 hours. Two hours later facial twitching reduced, respiratory rhythm slowed to 40 bpm and rectal temperature reduced to 37.9 °C. As the cat was not able to stand up, still unresponsive to surrounding stimulus, with mild tremors, ILE infusion was still continued for another 2 hours at 2 ml/kg/h, for a total time of 5 hours (). After this time neurological symptoms improved and temperature, heart rate, mucous membranes were within normal limit. Little facial twitching was still present and the animal was ataxic. On day 2 the cat still presented facial twitching, presented mild ataxia no tremors were observed and the animal was alert and eating without any problems.

The mass had been slowly enlarging over the preceding 3–4 months, was becoming increasingly tender and occasionally bled due to a superficial abrasion on the surface. The patient had a past medical history of Grave’s disease, atrial fibrillation and a perforated gastric ulcer.\nExamination revealed a 2 × 1.5cm mass over the distal pulp and hyponychium of the right middle finger. The swelling was mildly tender and there was an area of superficial ulceration centrally (). The digit was neurovascularly intact with normal range of motion and no evidence of local erythema, inflammation or discolouration. The working differential diagnosis following initial consultation included glomus tumour, ganglion cyst and haemangioma, thus the patient was booked for surgery without prior imaging.\nOne month following referral, the patient underwent excision biopsy of the lesion which was not found to be communicating with bone, nerve or tendon and the intra-operative impression was that of a ganglion cyst (). The initial histopathology examination reported a circumscribed multinodular predominantly solid tumour () ulcerating the overlying epidermis. There were focal papillary projections with tubular/ductal structures () where ducts were lined by a double layer of epithelium consisting of inner cuboidal cells and an outer myoepithelial layer (). There was also evidence of lymphovascular invasion (), focally high mitotic activity () and the tumour was shown to abut the margins. Immunohistochemistry was performed () confirming a myoepithelial cell population expressing smooth muscle actin, calponin, D2-40 () and p63 (). The tumour was classified as digital papillary adenocarcinoma. The histopathology sections were sent to an external institution for expert opinion and the diagnosis affirmed with recommendation of complete excision and close follow-up. This recommendation was echoed when the case was discussed at the local multi-disciplinary meeting.\nThe patient underwent partial amputation of the digit () and computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which showed no evidence of distant disease. The histology report on the wider excision specimen confirmed no invasion of underlying bone and margins free of tumour (residual tumour in wider specimen 0.5 mm).

He did not complain of fever, cough, and chronic diarrhea. He had a proton pump inhibitor for those symptoms from a doctor nearby, but no improvement was observed. On physical examination, his height and body weight were 153 cm and 42.0 kg, respectively. He had mild epigastric tenderness, but no masses were palpable on his whole abdomen. No peripheral edema was observed. His nails were intact, and no pigmentation was found in his whole skin or mucous membranes. Alopecia was not observed. He did not have any relatives with polyposis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Blood examination showed negative Helicobacter pylori antibody, antinuclear antibody, and normal serum IgG4 levels.\nChest and abdominal X-rays were normal. The patient underwent esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGDS), which revealed diffuse multiple sessile polypoid lesions in the whole stomach, but no polypoid lesions were seen in the esophagus or the duodenum (Fig. ). Colonoscopy showed similar multiple polypoid lesions in the terminal ileum, but no such polypoid lesions were observed in the whole colon (Fig. ). Pathology of the gastric polypoid lesions revealed hyperplastic mucosa, but focal dilated cystic glands were not seen (Fig. ). The tissue biopsy from the terminal ileum showed similar findings (Fig. ). He lacked chronic diarrhea and ectodermal abnormalities, which were seen in the typical CCS cases. No appropriate explanations of the diffuse gastrointestinal polyposis except for CCS were found, based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic and pathological findings. Therefore, we diagnosed him as having CCS.\nThe patient was treated with daily oral prednisolone, which was initially administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg with a proton pump inhibitor (vonoprazan fumarate: 20 mg daily), following tapered prednisolone and continued at a daily dose of 5 mg. After initiation of corticosteroids, he gradually recovered his appetite and gained weight up to 5 kg, accompanied by improved protein synthesis such as serum albumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol levels (Table ). EGDS 1 year after initiation of corticosteroid revealed that the size and the numbers of polypoid lesions had decreased, and the reddish lesions had changed to normal color (Fig. ).

    "problem": "<Context> A 36-year-old man (weight 81 kg, height 180 cm) symptomatic for fatigue and dyspnoea on mild exertion (New York Heart Association Class III) with past medical history of two aortic valve replacements (AVR) was referred to our institution because of a relapse of Staphylococcus warneri prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). He underwent the first AVR 2 years earlier for a steno-insufficient bicuspid aortic valve. After 8 months a redo AVR with annular reconstruction was needed due to PVE; S. warneri was isolated from the explanted valve. At time of referral the patient had completed the antibiotic therapy, the blood cultures were negative and the laboratory findings were within normal ranges. No risk factors for recurrent infections were identified. On physical examination, the main finding was a holodiastolic murmur over the aortic valve area. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a peri-prosthetic leak that determined a severe aortic insufficiency, good left ventricle’s (LV) contractility, and ejection fraction (EF = 60%). The transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography scan demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm at the level of the LV outflow tract (LVOT) extending towards the mitro-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (Video 1). Pre-operative coronary angiography (CA) showed normal coronary arteries ().\nA modified-Bentall technique with a composite mechanical valve conduit (St. Jude Medical Masters HP valved graft with Gelweave Valsalva conduit) was carried out. After transecting the ascending aorta, two buttons of aortic wall including the coronary ostia were isolated and mobilized. By implanting the valved conduit, the pseudoaneurysm was excluded and the LVOT was reconstructed. Then, the ostia were sutured to two corresponding openings in the Dacron graft with a continuous suture of 6-0 Prolene without using any foreign material and without the addition of glue. By using the Valsalva graft, tension-free anastomoses of the buttons were expected. No macroscopic technical problems were encountered.\nAt the time of weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the LV showed signs of failure. Intraoperative TOE evaluation in the transgastric short-axis view revealed a marked hypokinesis of the entire anterolateral wall and septum from the basal segments to the apex. Transoesophageal echocardiography findings in addition to the concomitant anterolateral ST-segment elevation on the 12-lead ECG suggested an acute impairment in blood supply thorough the proximal left coronary system. The origin of both coronary arteries was identified on TOE; kinking was excluded and Doppler evaluation showed the presence of blood flow through the ostia. The haemodynamic instability and difficulty in CPB weaning prompted an early strategy to re-establish coronary perfusion to the left coronary system. Surgical revascularization was performed with a saphenous vein graft anastomosed to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery and reimplanted on the aortic Dacron conduit. The second attempt of weaning from CPB was successful with normal ECG tracing and good whole myocardial contractility. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with stable haemodynamic. A control CA was performed after 48 h. The angiography showed a significant stenosis of the left main stem (LMS) due to a recently developed lesion consistent with haematoma of the coronary wall. The saphenous vein graft to mid-LAD anastomosis was patent and effectively supported the coronary flow downstream the lesion (). No percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed for the lesion. Hospital monitoring, medical treatment (aspirin 100 mg/day and warfarin with a target international normalized ratio range 2.0–3.0 due to the mechanical aortic valve), and angiographic follow-up were planned.\nThe post-operative course was further complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia successfully treated with IV antibiotics. The patient presented neither symptoms nor signs of angina and was discharged home on Day 28. At discharge the echocardiogram showed a good functioning prosthesis, mildly decreased LVEF (56%). The control CA was repeated after 6 months. It clearly revealed the resolution of the haematoma, a recovered LMS and LAD artery, while the vein graft was occluded ().

According to the medical records, the patient underwent two uneventful anesthesias using halothane combined with oxygen (O2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) for cleft lip revision at the age of 5 months and at the age of 4 years, respectively. The preoperative laboratory examinations were within normal values. Initial heart rate (95 bpm), blood pressure (145/80 mmHg), and peripheral oxygen saturation (96%) were unremarkable. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous application of 0.1 mg/kg piritramid, an initial bolus of 2.5 mg/kg propofol followed by an additional application of 1.5 mg/kg propofol, and 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. To secure patient's airways, a size 8,0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was inserted after direct laryngoscopy. Afterwards, anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane 1.5 vol% supplemented by O2/N2O and application of 0.05 mg/kg piritramid if needed. During the initial period of surgery, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were within normal limits with end-tidal carbon dioxide values between 38 and 39 mmHg. Suddenly, after 290 min a slightly increase of heart rate from 60 bpm to 80 bpm and a rise in systolic blood pressure from 120 mmHg to 135 mmHg were noticed. Furthermore, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration rapidly increased from 39 mmHg to 85 mmHg within 5 min after the onset of sinus tachycardia. Simultaneously, oxygen saturation decreased from 98% to 93%. Unfortunately, there was no monitoring of body temperature, but the attending anesthesiologist observed and documented warming of head and chest during this episode. After MH was suspected, the anesthesiologist immediately stopped sevoflurane and hyperventilated the patient with 100% oxygen (25 L/min). In addition, 240 mg dantrolene was applied twice and anesthesia was continued intravenously by infusion of 5 mg/kg/h propofol and repeated fentanyl applications. After these interventions, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were stabilized within 10 min.

At the age of 9 years, she had suspected high intestinal obstruction which was followed by surgery. The obstruction was not revealed during the surgery. In the postoperative period, signs of intestinal obstruction persisted, and they were managed conservatively. After the surgery, she developed meningeal signs, gaze paresis, double vision, and reduced vision. Electrocardiogram showed an incomplete type of blockade of the right branch of the bundle of His. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastric hypotony. Computed tomography scans of the head revealed moderate diffuse cortex atrophy. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear with 0.066. The patient was seen by a neurologist, ophthalmologist, infectious diseases specialist, and neurosurgeon. However, the diagnosis remained unclear. The following pathologies were excluded: neuro infections, intestinal infections, oncohematology, and endocrine pathologies. Further generalized pathology persisted.

After uremic symptoms, hemodialysis was started 3 days a week by transjugular catheter 5 months ago. Because of catheter malfunction, his catheter was replaced in the another medical center. Ten days after catheter malposition, his complaints started. On admission, the patient was good, conscious and orientated and his fever was: 38.5 °C, pulse: 104 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 26/min, blood pressure: 100/50 mmHg. During physical examination, distension, right flank pain and venous collateral development was observed in the patient’s abdomen.

In the axial contrast enhanced venous phase CT image, a hypodense thrombus was observed in which the distal end of the catheter is at the level of drainage of the hepatic veins into the vena cava inferior and that blocked hepatic vein drainage around the catheter. Additionally, mosaic contrast pattern and perihepatic fluid is seen on computed tomography (CT) (optima CT 540, GE, USA) image (Fig. ). Thrombus around the catheter was also confirmed by Doppler US (GE Logiq Pg medical System (GE, Healthcare,Chicago,IL,USA))examination.\nThe sagittal reformat, in which the distal tip of the catheter was inferior to the vena cava, was also observed in the CT image (Fig. ) The patient’s diagnosis was accepted Acute Budd Chiari syndrome developed as a result of catheter malposition. Heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (Vankomycin/meropenem) were administered for the patient immediately. The catheter was removed and a new catheter was inserted in the same session.

    "problem": "<Context> A 64-year-old Hispanic man with traumatic paraplegia presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI). He had a neurogenic bladder and a history of recurrent UTIs but no prior history of psychiatric diseases. On examination, he was noted to have a temperature of 100.7 °F (38.17 °C), blood pressure of 93/56 mm Hg, a pulse of 147 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. He had labored breathing, suprapubic tenderness, and frank pus in his urine when a urinary catheter was placed. He was emergently intubated and mechanically ventilated because his cardiorespiratory status deteriorated. At the time of admission, our patient’s white blood cell (WBC) count was 16,500/μL (neutrophils 75 %, lymphocyte 12.5 %, and bands 8.4 %). His biochemical parameters were within physiological limits except for his serum creatinine at 2.4 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 52 mg/dL. Two sets of blood culture and a urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae (a final report including the culture antibiotic sensitivity was reported on day 4 of his hospitalization). A renally adjusted dose of imipenem-cilastatin was initiated because of his prior history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella UTIs. Sedatives were discontinued, and our patient was successfully extubated after he demonstrated clinical improvement. Our patient was oriented to place, person, time, and situation after extubation; an assessment using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) did not demonstrate any delirium. His family noted that he looked better and was conversing normally. The dose of imipenem-cilastatin was readjusted (increased) on his third day of hospitalization owing to the recovery of his renal function. On the fourth day of hospitalization, he was restless and agitated by paranoid thoughts (Fig. ). He reported seeing and hearing people from his church planning to burn him at the stake.\nThe differential diagnoses entertained at this time were ICU delirium, encephalitis, endocrine dysfunction, structural neurological lesions (possibly stroke), or toxic ingestion. Our patient was oriented to place, person, and time with no new neurological deficits except for the visual and auditory hallucinations. Despite having an acute change in his baseline mental status (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score [RASS] 0 to 1+), he did not demonstrate any inattention (as demonstrated by picking ‘2’s) and, therefore, CAM-ICU was not diagnostic for ICU delirium. When our patient’s laboratory tests were repeated at the time of the psychotic symptoms, his WBC count was 9400/μL (neutrophils 74.2 %, lymphocyte 14.2 %). His biochemistry panel revealed serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (eGFR, 65 mL/min/1.73 m2), BUN of 15 mg/dL, serum sodium of 138 mEq/L, serum potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, serum chloride of 102 mEq/L, and serum bicarbonate of 22 mEq/L. His 8 a.m. cortisol level was 18 μg/dL and his thyroid function was within physiological limits (TSH 1.04 mIU/L, free T4 7.4 μg/dL, and free T3 83 ng/dL). Repeat urine and blood cultures performed while he was experiencing psychotic symptoms were later reported to have tested negative for any infection. Further neurological imaging or invasive neurological procedures were not performed because he did not have any new focal neurological deficits.\nBrief psychotic episode was diagnosed as per the fifth edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, and delirium was excluded because inattention could not be demonstrated. All reversible causes of psychosis were sought. The only change in the management of our patient was a change in the dose of imipenem-cilastatin; this was considered to be a possible etiology for psychosis. Objective evidence of a causal relationship between the drug and psychosis was assessed using the Naranjo Probability Scale. Our patient’s Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability scale score was calculated to be +7; imipenem-cilastatin was the probable culprit []. Imipenem-cilastatin was discontinued, and he was switched to ceftriaxone according to susceptibilities from the blood and urine culture. His mood and behavior improved; all visual and auditory hallucinations resolved by his sixth day of hospitalization. He experienced similar psychiatric symptoms 2 months later when imipenem-cilastatin was initiated empirically for complicated UTI. On this readmission, the Naranjo ADR probability scale score was +9, definite, when he was rechallenged with imipenem-cilastatin. His hallucinations resolved within 48 hours of discontinuing imipenem-cilastatin, as in the first instance. Unfortunately, on both occasions, the levels of imipenem or cilastatin were not estimated owing to laboratory and logistic issues. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta ratio? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 2.0 mEq/L / 2.0 mEq/L = 1.0. The patient's delta ratio is 1.0.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 55 year old woman was referred to our Endocrinology Department in June 2006 for further investigation of multiple severe hypoglycemic attacks. She complained of sweating, tachycardia, palpitations, weakness, confusion and described episodes of hypoglycemic coma occurring in the last two months. She had severely limited physical activity because of hypoglycemia-related symptoms at minimal efforts. She had gradually gained weight (12 kg in the last two months) because of increased food intake to correct hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been previously diagnosed and treated for high blood pressure.\nPhysical examination showed an overweight patient (BMI=29kg/m2). She had normal blood pressure (with antihypertensive treatment), normal pulse rate and body temperature. The abdomen was soft but with painless hepatomegaly. Physical examination of the cervical region revealed a mild goiter with normal consistency and no regional adenopathy.\nLaboratory tests showed the presence of hypoglycemia (30mg/dl) associated with an increased value of plasma insulin (16µU/ml). Normal insulin level for glycemia under 45mg/dl must be below 6µU/ml. The calculated ratio of glycemia/insulinemia in our patient was 1.87 instead of the normal value of less than 0.25.\nIn a patient without previous treatment with insulin and sulfonylurea, failure to suppress endogenous insulin secretion in the presence of hypoglycemia is the hallmark of an insulinoma.\nWe also found elevated liver enzymes (ALT=47iu/l, AST=72iu/l, GGT=133iu/l). Decreased serum albumin (2.8g/dl) and prolonged prothrombin time indicated hepatic failure.\nAbdominal CT revealed a 1.5cm mass localized at the head of pancreas and multiple tumors disseminated in both liver lobes (). Thoracic CT scan did not find any abnormal aspects suggestive of metastases. In order to establish the etiology of hepatic masses an ultrasound – guided liver biopsy was performed. Histological examination showed hepatic tissue with tumoral areas presenting an aspect of neuroendocrine carcinoma (). The immunohistochemistry study confirmed the neuroendocrine origin of the hepatic tumors (, , , ) showing tumoral cells with focal and diffuse expression for Chomogranin A, Synaptophysin and CD57; anti-Vimentin was positive in rare tumoral cells like Cytokeratin 18; anti-CD34 showed a denser vascular network; anti-Ki67 antibody displayed a nuclear expression in rare tumoral cells ( ~5%).\nThese findings established the diagnosis of malignant insulinoma with liver metastases.\nBiochemical evaluation also revealed a mild elevation of total calcium 10.4mg/dl (normal upper range of serum calcium:10.2 mg/dl), normal serum phosphorus level of 4mg/dl (normal range: 2.5-4.5mg/dl) and increased alkaline phosphatase 405iu/l (normal range: 80-285iu/l).\nIn order to investigate the source of hypercalcemia, more tests were performed. We measured the PTH that revealed a mild elevated level of 71.2pg/ml (normal range: 10-69pg/ml) and 24 hour urinary calcium which was 180mg/dl (normal range between 100-300mg/24h).\nHypercalcemia with high PTH suggested the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.\nAnterior neck ultrasound revealed a multinodular goiter with multiple nodules under 1cm, but did not give any information about parathyroid glands. A cervical CT was performed but it didn’t reveal any pathological parathyroid findings.\nThe coexistence of primary hyperparathyroidism and an enteropancreatic tumor (malignant insulinoma) suggested the presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). Because of the high frequency of pituitary adenomas, especially prolactin-secreting ones among MEN 1 patients, we measured serum prolactin but we found a normal level: PRL=11.7ng/ml (normal ranges: 3-18 ng/ml).\nIn order to evaluate the presence of a pituitary adenoma we performed a cerebral CT scan which didn’t reveal any pathological aspects for the pituitary gland. We also considered the normal aspect of both adrenal glands on the abdominal CT in order to exclude an adrenal tumor, possibly associated with MEN 1.\nWe started treatment and recommended a daily 250-300g of carbohydrate intake in eight meals (every 2-3 hours). In order to improve glycemic control, we administered verapamil 240 mg/day, but no result was obtained.\nThe patient was referred to the surgical department but because of the magnitude of liver tumors and coexistence of liver dysfunction, surgical intervention was not an option. Impaired liver function was also a contraindication for hepatic artery embolization.\nWe decided to start medical treatment with a somatostatin analog. Our first option was long-acting lanreotide, 30mg at two weeks, but without response in terms of glycemic values. Instead, octreotide acetate 0.15mg/day (0.05 mg subcutaneously every 8 hours) was more effective, reducing both the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes. We recommended that glucagon be available for the patient’s emergency use.\nBecause of the general condition of the patient and the absence of advanced features of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid surgery was not performed; we administered biphosphonate therapy as specific inhibitor agents of bone resorption (alendronate 70mg, once a week) associated with moderate dietary calcium restriction to 1000 mg/day and adequate hydration.\nAfter two months (in August 2006) the symptoms were more difficult to control even with double doses of Octreotide (0.30mg/day subcutaneously).\nLaboratory tests showed a worsening situation: glycemia=20mg/dl, insulinemia=190,7µU/ml; glycemia/insulinemia ratio=9,53, ALT=63iu/L, AST=117iu/L, GGT=272iu/L and a total level of calcium (11.1ng/dl).\nAbdominal CT revealed a progression of the pancreatic tumor (2.5cm) and increased number and dimension of liver metastases ().\nWe considered the disease as being progressive and a chemotherapeutical regimen with doxorubicin (100mg/day IV every 21 days) was instituted. After three months of chemotherapy no improvement was seen in biochemical or hormonal parameters. Moreover, CT exam showed a progression of hepatic masses and the presence of multiple sub pleural metastases. We decided to stop doxorubicin administration.\nThe patient died in December 2006 at home, probably in a hypoglycemic coma. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Hence, measurement of elevated concentrations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma by mass spectrometry [] was performed after birth; then, isovaleric acid CoA dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by assaying its enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts [].\nThe child was admitted to the local hospital two days ago because of new-onset upper abdominal pain. Although she was unable to describe the nature and character of the pain, it was not severe enough to require analgesics. One day prior to her admission to us, she developed vomiting that eventually became bilious.\nThe patient who had normal growth and development was on oral L-carnitine supplementation since infancy. Beside that, she was not receiving any other medications. Her family history was negative for pancreatitis. On admission to us, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. On physical examination, there was moderate upper abdominal tenderness without rebound, while she had normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Laboratory studies on admission revealed the following: leukocytes 10,110/μL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, platelets 169,000/μL, glucose 185 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL), urea 26 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.6 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, AST 34 U/L, ALT 22 U/L, LDH 426 U/L (normal < 280 U/L), albumin 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, γ-GT 16 U/L, triglycerides 80 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, and amylase 536 U/L (normal 40–140 U/L). Arterial blood gases showed the following: pH 7.55, pCO2 21 mmHg, pO2 133 mmHg, HCO3 23 mmol/L, and base deficit 3.8 mmol/L. The anion gap was estimated at 7. A coagulation profile and a urine analysis were normal.\nDue to the bilious nature of vomiting, an abdominal ultrasound () was obtained that showed a notably enlarged and edematous pancreas, along with the presence of peripancreatic exudates that were extending bilaterally towards the anterior paranephric spaces and towards the right colon. The wall of the duodenum was also diffusely edematous. No gallstones were seen, the bile duct was not distended, and there was no sludge in it, while the liver, spleen, and appendix were visualized without echomorphologic abnormalities.\nSince the goal of management of acute pancreatitis is to achieve analgesia, adequate rehydration, and organ rest, the child was managed with discontinuation of oral feedings, placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose with electrolytes, and administration of intravenous ranitidine and of L-carnitine, 500 mg every 8 hours, that is, approximately 100 mg/kg/day.\nThe patient's clinical course was uncomplicated. Serum amylase normalized (84 U/L) on the 4th hospital day. She was fed with a low-fat and protein diet on the 6th hospital day. On the same day, the intravenous fluids were discontinued. Two follow-up ultrasonographic examinations on the 3rd and 5th () hospital days showed progressive but rapid resolution of the pancreatic edema and of the peripancreatic exudates.

To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 23.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 23.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 23.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 23.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.

One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 7. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 7.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 7-year-old girl (Case 1) with short stature and early breast budding visited our clinic. She was born with a weight of 2.74 kg at 38 weeks of gestation (10–25th percentile, −1.45 standard deviation score, SDS). Her height at birth was 46 cm (−2.52 SDS). The heights of her father and mother were 167 cm (−1.1 SDS) and 143 cm (−3.8 SDS), respectively, and her mother had experienced her menarche at 11 years of age. The midparental height was estimated at 148.5 cm (−2.55 SDS). The girl had a height of 108.6 cm (−3.37 SDS), body weight of 21.5 kg (−0.38 SDS), head circumference of 50 cm (−0.37 SDS), and arm span of 109 cm. She did not have a goiter. She had Tanner-stage-II breasts, whereas her pubic hair was of Tanner stage I. She presented with macrocephaly, frontal bossing, a triangular face, prominent philtrum, full lips, a short neck, fifth-finger clinodactyly, and prominent heels (). Nevertheless, she had no developmental issues, except that her bone age (BA) was advanced to 8 years and 10 months (height for BA: −5.11 SDS). Skeletal survey revealed lumbar lordosis, brachydactyly, and a narrowed pelvic cavity (). Laboratory tests for chemistry and thyroid hormone showed normal levels. The serum IGF-1 and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels were 232.0 ng/mL (0.1 SDS) and 4670 ng/mL (3.5 SDS), respectively. GH provocation test showed normal peak GH levels (10.3 and 18.9 ng/mL), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test revealed a pubertal pattern (luteinizing hormone peak: 10.7 IU/L). Her karyotype was also normal.\nHer older sister (Case 2, 10 years and 9 months of age) visited our clinic with a concern of early menarche. She had experienced menarche when she was 9 years and 10 months old. She was born with a weight of 2.82 kg (50–75th percentile, −1.26 SDS) at 36 weeks of gestation. Her facial features resembled those of her younger sister, and the typical prominent heel form was observed (). Her height, weight, and head circumference at presentation were 137 cm (0.01 SDS), 44 kg (0.97 SDS), and 54.5 cm (2.58 SDS), respectively. Breasts and pubic hair were of Tanner stages IV and III, respectively. Her BA was advanced to 13 years and 6 months (height for BA: −3.03 SDS), and her predicted adult height was 142 cm (−4.04 SDS) as per the Greulich-Pyle criteria.\nTargeted exome sequencing was performed to assess for genetic abnormalities. Genetic testing revealed two heteroallelic mutations (transheterozygosity) in OBSL1 (NM_015311.2)—c.2135-3_2135-2del and c.3341G>A (p.Trp1114*) (). It should be noted that this is the first time these two mutations have been identified in patients with 3-M syndrome. The population allele frequencies of c.2135-3_2135-2del and c.3341G>A(p.Trp1114*) are reported as 0.0006 and 0.0001 in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, ), respectively.\nThe two sisters showed central precocious puberty, which occurred incidentally independent of 3-M syndrome. To date, no association between 3-M syndrome and precocious puberty has been reported. Despite the central precocious puberty, the sisters were treated with GH and a GnRH agonist for their pathological short stature and precocious puberty. Following 22 months of combination therapy with GH and GnRH (at 9 years and 8 months of age), the height gain of Case 1 was 12.6 cm (height: 121.2 cm, −2.3 SDS), and her BA was advanced to 10.5 years (height for BA: −2.91 SDS). Case 2, on the other hand, received 3 months of GH therapy alone, and then 6 months of the combination therapy with GH and GnRH agonist. Although the age of Case 2 was over the optimal age for GnRH-agonist therapy, we nevertheless subjected her to this therapy to delay the menarche and lengthen the GH treatment duration. After 9 months, her height gain was 4 cm (height: 141 cm), and her BA was advanced to 14 years (height for BA: −2.86 SDS). The doses of GH and GnRH agonist were 0.27 mg/kg/week and 11.75 mg/12 weeks, respectively.\nAfter the combination therapy, height SDS values for the BA of Case 1 and 2 improved from −5.11 and −3.03 to −2.91 and −2.86, respectively.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patients regarding the reporting and publication of this case report.

    "problem": "<Context> A 58-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department via EMS as a possible stroke. Per spouse, he woke up from sleep with left-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and left arm weakness. He had gone to sleep at approximately 10 pm and awoke with the left-sided complaints at approximately 4 am the morning of arrival. He had a past medical history of adrenal adenoma, chronic gastritis, and a vasectomy in 1993. The patient's medications prior to admission were alprazolam, esomeprazole, probiotics, and a daily multivitamin. The patient is aware of his left-sided weakness and complains of heaviness on his left side. He reports no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. The patient's spouse reported that he had been unwell for three months with unexplained weight loss, fever, chills, and loss of appetite. At the time of presentation, various specialists including gastroenterology failed to determine an underlying cause for the patient's complaints besides “anemia of chronic disease.” Furthermore, he was scheduled for an upper and lower endoscopy the day of presentation and was in the process of preparation (cathartics) for that. He has been on a gluten-free diet for elevated tissue transglutaminase and gliadin antibody titers by his endocrinologist. Upon arrival at patient's residence, EMS reported a positive stroke screen with a Cincinnati score of 2, positive for left arm weakness, and left-sided facial droop. Vital signs upon arrival to the Emergency Department were temperature 36.4 degrees Celsius by tympanic reading, pulse 105 beats per minute, blood pressure 116/56 mmHg, respirations 18 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air. His weight was recorded as 68 kilograms. He was not in any distress but appeared pale and cachectic. His neurologic exam was positive for a left facial droop with weakness of cranial nerves 3, 5, and 7. There was no uvular deviation, and pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally with intact extraocular movements. The upper extremities had symmetric sensation to fine touch with a left pronator drift and 3/5 strength in the proximal and distal muscle groups in comparison to the right. There was no dysmetria. The lower extremities had 5/5 strength bilaterally and absent Babinski reflexes. His NIH stroke scale score was 6. The rest of his physical exam was unremarkable.\nInitial labs included a metabolic panel with measured sodium of 131 mmol/L and blood glucose of 125 mg/dL but were otherwise normal. The complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.9%. The white blood cell count was 12.5 thou/cu mm with 78.8% neutrophils and no bands. Cardiac enzymes and urinalysis were both normal. The point-of-care INR was 1.5. Stroke alert protocol imaging included a CT angiogram of the head and neck with and without contrast and postprocedure multiplanar reconstructions. These revealed acute/subacute CVA in the right insula cortex and right basal ganglia () as well as significant narrowing of the proximal M1 branch of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) secondary to either embolus or atherosclerotic disease (). Perfusion images demonstrate elevated time to peak in the posterior right MCA distribution with normal capillary transit time and normal cerebral blood volume consistent with compensated collateral blood flow ().\nThe patient received 300 mg aspirin per rectum and IV fluids prior to admission to the neuro-ICU. The patient was deemed an unsuitable candidate for thrombolysis as onset was estimated approximately 6 hours prior to ED arrival. Neurosurgery was consulted and decided that the risks of endovascular therapy did not outweigh the benefits for the patient.\nFollowup the next day revealed that the patient had an echocardiogram that showed a mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mitral regurgitation. Following echocardiogram, the patient had an acute sudden deterioration in his mental status and displayed respiratory compromise. On examination, his pupils were “blown” (enlarged) bilaterally and he was emergently intubated for airway protection. His emergent noncontrast CT of the head () showed a subcortical hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and subfalcine herniation. Neurosurgery emergently brought the patient to the operating room with a postoperative diagnosis of right intracranial hemorrhage secondary to ruptured mycotic MCA aneurysm. On postoperative day one, the family decided to withdraw care and the patient expired. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

He did not have any remarkable life histories. Five months before admission, the man complained of headaches, fatigue, and a hearing abnormality. Then, he experienced nausea, diarrhea, and drowsiness for 6 days and subsequently sought evaluation at our hospital. The physical examination at the time of admission revealed that he was slow to respond (Japan Coma Scale 1-1). The following measurements were obtained: height, 161.2 cm; weight, 51.0 kg; BMI, 19.6 kg/m2; blood pressure, 119/78 mmHg; heart rate, 62 bpm; and body temperature, 37.4°C. The remainder of the examination findings were normal, without any signs of meningitis.\nThe initial laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 11700/μL, with 87.0% neutrophils (86% segmented and 1% band neutrophils), 2.0% lymphocytes, 10%monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 1% metamyelocytes, hemoglobin = 15.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 157,000/μL. The serum C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated (0.80 mg/dL). Although the serum sodium level was slightly decreased (130 mEq/L), the potassium (4.6 mEq/L), chloride (97 mEq/L), creatinine (0.59 mg/dL), fasting glucose (85 mEq/L), and HbA1c (5.1%) concentrations were normal.\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral adrenal enlargement (right, 10.0 × 20.0 mm; left, 29.0 × 29.0 mm). A retrospective analysis of the CT images revealed that the enlargement in the left adrenal gland developed 5 months before admission (), which coincided with the onset of fevers and headaches. Subsequently, the bilateral adrenal enlargement progressed (). The differential diagnosis of adrenal enlargement includes metastatic carcinoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, tuberculosis, and fungal infections. A whole-body examination failed to find a primary malignant lesion. The QuantiFERON-TB test and HIV antibody titer were negative.Although there were no signs of meningeal irritation, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid revealed an increased white blood cell count (240/μL), a normal protein level, a decreased glucose level (0.10 g/l), and a positive cryptococcal antigen titer. The pathologic specimen showed the presence of yeast-like organisms, such as Cryptococcus spp. on Alcian blue staining, which was subsequently determined to be Cryptococcus neoformans.\nAlthough the level of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was elevated (131.3 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3 pg/mL) at the time of the diagnosis of cryptococcosis (), cortisol release in response to ACTH (Cortrosyn), which was evaluated 1 day after prednisolone cessation, was increased (). Oral prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) was then resumed as treatment for the protein-losing gastroenteropathy. The other endocrinological data of adrenal gland ruled out the possibility of pheochromocytoma and aldosterone-secreting tumors in this patient ().\nAmphotericin B (250 mg/day) was initiated, followed by the addition of fluconazole (400 mg/day). The symptoms improved gradually after beginning antifungal treatment. Fluconazole alone was continued after discharge. After the initiation of antifungal treatment, the elevated ACTH levels were decreased and varied during the treatment (), suggesting a stressed condition with infection at the diagnosis and unstable absorption of prednisolone due to the protein-losing gastroenteropathy. Mild hyponatremia probably due to relative adrenal insufficiency was improved to the normal range (138 mEq/L) one month after the initiation of the antifungal treatment.\nAn abdominal CT, which was routinely obtained during follow-up, showed that the size of the adrenal glands decreased following antifungal therapy and became normal without any abnormal findings, including calcifications, 6 months after starting treatment (). </Context> <Question> What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? </Question>",

The concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 11.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 69.0 mg/dL.

She had been hypertensive for 5 years; she did not have a history of diabetes or ischemic heart disease. She was on treatment for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia with enalapril 5 mg daily and fenofibrate 200 mg daily. She did not have a history suggestive of renal disease, autoimmune disorder, or connective tissue disorder. She failed to recall any history of major trauma, dehydration, ingestion of drugs and/or toxins, or seizures within the last few weeks. She is a housewife and mother of two children. Similar to many Asian women, she did not consume alcohol and she did not smoke tobacco. She was married to a hospital clerk, and did not recall exposure to toxins. She was not living in an endemic area of chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities (CINAC).\nShe had a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg, with normal cardiovascular examination. She was not pale. She did not have any edema on examination. Her serum creatinine was 126 umol/L, with a blood urea of 3.2 mmol/L. Urine analysis revealed bland sediment with 100 mg/dL of protein, but no hemoglobin or myoglobin. A full blood count showed hemoglobin of 112 g/L, with a mean corpuscular volume of 98 fl. This raised the possibility of hypothyroidism. Further investigations showed a UPCR of 1.6, elevated serum lipids, TSH of > 100 U/L, and CK of 3980 U/L. Her liver profile showed alanine transferase (ALT) of 45 (reference range < 30), aspartate transferase (AST) of 56 (reference range < 30), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 122 (reference range < 245), slight derangement. An initial diagnosis of fenofibrate-induced rhabdomyolysis was made, and fenofibrate was withdrawn from the treatment. She was initiated on management of rhabdomyolysis with alkaline diuresis. An ultrasound scan of her abdomen revealed normal-looking kidneys and no lymphadenopathy. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, antinuclear factor, C3 level, and C4 level, were all within reference ranges. Urine myoglobin and urine hemosiderin deposits were negative. However, there was no change in her CK levels (3870 U/L) or creatinine (133 umol/L) levels after a lapse of 2 weeks, and we decided her elevated CK levels were unlikely to be due to fenofibrate-induced rhabdomyolysis. We assumed it was due to hypothyroidism and started an escalating dose of thyroxine at 25 μg/day, with increments of 25 μg each 2 weeks, up to 75 μg/day. A renal biopsy was not performed initially as rhabdomyolysis was not likely, and it was not performed later due to rapid resolution with thyroxine. An ultrasound plus duplex of her thyroid revealed a multinodular goiter with no prominent or vascular nodules. Her CK gradually dropped over the next 12 weeks, with her creatinine, to 93 umol/L. Her UPCR reduced to 0.6 after 6 months of treatment. At the end of 6 months of follow-up her renal function and thyroid functions normalized, and proteinuria was absent.\nIn both patients, thyroglobulin antibodies tests were not performed due to economic constraints.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 47 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 126.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 126.0 µmol. To convert 126.0 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 126.0 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000126 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000126 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.014 g Creatinine. To convert 0.014 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 126.0 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 1.4 mg Creatinine/dL.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 119.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 7.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 7.2 mmol. To convert 7.2 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.2 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.196 g bun. To convert 0.196 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.196 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 196.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 196.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 19.6 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 7.2 mmol bun/L converts to 19.6 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 40.62 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 40.62 mmol. To convert 40.62 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 40.62 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.041 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.041 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 7.387 g glucose. To convert 7.387 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 7.387 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 7387.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 7387.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 738.7 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 40.62 mmol glucose/L converts to 738.7 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 119.0 + (19.6 / 2.8) + (19.6 / 18) = 286.039 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 286.039 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 286.039 mOsm/kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with type 2 diabetes presented to our emergency department with a three-week history of generalized malaise, associated poor oral intake, and some diarrhea. Her enteric symptoms were vague and unquantifiable. She was obese and had a past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for 15 years, hypertension, asthma, and depression. Her regular medication comprised metformin 3g daily, modified-release gliclazide 60mg daily, aspirin 100mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily, ramipril 10mg daily, and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. Our patient was brought into hospital by ambulance; her pre-hospital observations were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale score, 15; blood sugar level, 2.8mmol/L; blood pressure, 90/40mmHg; pulse, 54 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and peripheral oxygen saturation, 98% on 8L oxygen via a variable oxygen delivery mask. On arrival to our emergency department, she was confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 out of 15 (E4V4M6), with the rest of her physiological parameters similar to her pre-hospital observations.\nHer initial investigations were as follows: serum sodium, 140mmol/L (normal range: 137 to 145mmol/L); serum potassium, 7.3mmol/L (normal range: 3.5 to 4.9mmol/L); serum chloride, 91mmol/L (normal range: 100 to 109mmol/L); serum bicarbonate, 1mmol/L (normal range: 22 to 32mmol/L); anion gap, 55mmol/L (normal range: 7 to 17mmol/L); serum glucose, 2.3mmol/L; urea, 30.8mmol/L (normal range: 2.7 to 8.0mmol/L); and serum creatinine, 768umol/L (normal range: 50 to 100umol/L). Results from liver function tests were normal. Her troponin level was 50ng/L (normal range: <30ng/L). Venous blood gas measurements revealed a profound metabolic acidemia: pH, 6.58; partial pressure of CO2, 38.6mmHg; HCO3, 3.6mmol/L; glucose, 2.0mmol/L; and lactate, 16.7mmol/L. Her initial resuscitation strategy included 2000mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate, 15 units insulin (Actrapid) in 50mL 50% dextrose, and 1mL/kg of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution.\nMinutes after these initial investigations, our patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was managed as per advanced life support protocol. She had a total downtime of 25 minutes. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation she was intubated and ventilated. Following return of spontaneous circulation, she required an infusion of adrenaline for blood pressure support. She had an unremarkable chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and toxicology screen.\nWith a presumed diagnosis of ischemic bowel based on vague abdominal features and profound lactatemia, our patient was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for preoperative optimization. In our ICU, she was sedated and ventilated on an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% and on modest ventilator paramters (peak inspiratory pressure <25cmH2O). To treat her severe circulatory shock, she was fluid-resuscitated with a total of 10,000mL crystalloid from a central venous pressure of 8cmH2O to 16cmH2O. In addition, she required very high doses of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was commenced at exchange rates of 50mL/kg/h using Hemosol B0 solution. She was empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam (Tazocin) as broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover.\nOur patient went to theater 26 hours post admission for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed no significant findings. We continued her broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover despite negative microbiological cultures. Renal replacement therapy continued and our patient’s acid-base balance slowly normalized over three days. Having excluded all causes of a high anion gap lactic acidosis, including negative red blood cell transketolase activity for thiamine deficiency, we presumed our patient to have had a severe MALA ‘triggered’ by an acute kidney injury from dehydration. This was supported by a serum metformin level of 4mg/L. Her renal function slowly improved with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and she slowly recovered with a total of 35 days stay in ICU. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of glucose is 2.3 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 2.3 mmol. To convert 2.3 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.3 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.36 g glucose. To convert 0.36 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.36 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 360.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 360.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 36.0 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 2.3 mmol glucose/L converts to 36.0 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging in these values into the formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (36.0 - 100) = 138.464 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 138.464 mEq/L.",

He was 170 centimeters tall, and his body weight was 53 kilograms. He was a car mechanic, and had no specific medical history or trauma history. At first, the pain started after taking a late-night snack. It was described as being severe squeezing in nature, which located on the right side of the periumbilical area that had persisted all day long. He did not have history of any sports activities. The pain intensity in visual analogue scale (VAS) was about 60-70 of 100. He had been on medication for gastrointestinal tract with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the other hospital for over two months. The medication had no effect at all. For further evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography (CT), contrast media study of small and large intestine, endoscopy, and colonoscopy were done. Laboratory tests and simple x-rays of chest, abdomen, and lumbar spine were also performed. The examinations showed no specific abnormal findings. The patient was examined in supine position, and the site of maximum tenderness was identified; then he was asked to fold his arms across the upper chest, and to sit half way up. He complained greater tenderness with continuous local palpation, which is called Carnett test positive. It implies that the pain originated from the abdominal wall []. For both diagnostic and therapeutic purpose, we decided to make an injection of local anesthetics at the area of rectus muscle where the entrapment of cutaneous nerve could occur. The patient was placed in supine position. We conducted Carnett test again to find the maximal tender point. The transducer (Linear probe 12-5 Hz, HDI 5000, Philips, USA) was positioned in the midline first, to get a short axis view (anatomic transverse view) so that the medial border of the rectus muscle and the linea alba are visulized. Then the transducer moved laterally to get a view of the lateral end of the rectus muscle and the linea semilunaris (). The abdominal cutaneous nerve generally exists between the rectus abdominis and linea semilunaris, approximately 0.5-1.0 cm medial to linea semilunaris. Using the transverse scan, 25G 38 mm needle (BD Precision Glide™ Needle, Becton Dickinson Medical, Singapore) was advanced with the short axis in plane technique to reach the target area (). We injected 10 ml of 1% of mepivacaine with 10 mg of triamcinolone. The pain intensity in VAS decreased to 30 of 100 with a single injection. With one week of interval, booster injection was done. After the second injection, the pain intensity in VAS decreased to 0-10 of 100.

    "problem": "<Context> A 44-year-old man was referred to the cardiology department because of an incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB) detected in the electrocardiogram (EKG). No epsilon or negative T waves were found on the EKG (). He had no history of familiar sudden cardiac death and he did not have any previous disease despite he was a carrier of C-hepatitis virus. No medication was needed for the treatment of that virus because transaminase enzymes in blood analysis were in normal range and abdominal echography showed normal liver morphology. He was only taking sertraline and bromazepam because of depressive syndrome. He remained completely asymptomatic, in NYHA functional class I/IV, and his physical examination did not show any abnormal finding. In order to begin the study of the IRBBB we first performed an echocardiogram in which a severe right ventricle (RV) dilatation () and a moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) appeared. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was preserved (55%) and mitral and aortic valves were normal, in function and morphology. The estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was normal and there was not any indirect sign of pulmonary hypertension. To better characterize the findings in the RV, a magnetic resonance (MR) was performed. It showed a diastolic diameter of the RV of 55 mm () and confirmed the functional cause of the TR (ring dilatation). There were not any dyskinesia or akinesia areas (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2, www.jocmr.org) or pathologic gadolinium enhancement, and RV ejection fraction was 57%. Abnormal venous drainage was also excluded with the MR. The transesophageal echocardiography did not find any interatrial () or interventricular septal defects. Holter monitoring did not find any arrhythmic event. Hemodynamic study showed normal pulmonary pressures (systolic pulmonary artery pressure/mean pulmonary artery pressure/diastolic pulmonary artery pressure of 24/14/7 mm Hg respectively) and normal pulmonary wedge pressure (12 mm Hg) which led us to exclude pulmonary hypertension as the cause of the RV dilatation. Cardiac ischemic disease was excluded by performing a coronary angiography. No atherosclerosis plaques in the coronary arteries were found. Pulmonary functions tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1): 117%; FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC): 84%), diffusion capacity (DLCO: 115%), artery gasometry and polysomnographic study were also normal. We lastly performed a pulmonary angiography, in which a chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease was also excluded. We decided not to start any medication due to the lack of symptoms of the patient and we also decided to keep a watchful waiting attitude. The patient was catalogued as an isolated form of right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy due to the finding of an RV dilatation, without any potential cause for it.

He underwent a renal transplantation 21 years prior to his current presentation due to renal failure secondary to diabetes and hypertension. The renal artery of the transplanted kidney arose from the right internal iliac artery. His renal function was marginal due to chronic rejection with creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values of around 4.0 mg/dL and 50 mg/dL, respectively. His AAA was repaired with a Zenith (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA) bifurcated stent graft. A 30 mm × 117 mm Zenith main body device was placed through the left common femoral artery with \"preclose technique\" using 7F Proglide (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA). An 18 mm × 71 mm limb extender was used as the ipsilateral extension. A 24 mm × 71 mm was used as contralateral extension. A type Ib endoleak arising from the right iliac artery was noted on the completion angiogram (). Another 24 mm × 54 mm limb extender was placed to overcome this type Ib endoleak. There was no endoleak with final angiogram (). There was no change in renal perfusion after EVAR according to the completion angiogram. A total of 30 mL of Visipaque (iodixanol) was used for this patient. The total fluoroscopic time was 90 minutes. The patient's renal function was slightly decreased after EVAR (creatinine and BUN of 4.1-4.4 mg/dL and 53-58 mg/dL, respectively). The hemodialysis was not needed after EVAR.

Due to the anonymity of cadaver donation, clinical history was unavailable. Cause of death was attributed to sepsis secondary to a grade 3 sacral bedsore with contributing causes of heart and renal failure. However, during initial dissection in our medical anatomy course, muscles in the shoulders and hips were found to be fat-replaced and a form of muscular dystrophy was suspected. From donor information and public records, it was learned that the donor had been in military service and developed an unspecified form of muscular dystrophy in his adult life. In an attempt to determine the specific genotype of MD in the donor, DNA was submitted for a comprehensive MD panel (Invitae, San Francisco CA), but was of insufficient quality to provide results.\nAccording to U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines, the present protocols do not require Institutional Review Board review or approval, given the nature of this study on a cadaveric (non-living) subject. Use of this cadaver for the present study conforms with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine as well as the donor-signed agreement with the University of West Virginia Human Gift Registry “[...] to donate remains for anatomical study in the advancement of scientific and medical education and research.”\nTo directly evaluate the phenotypic distribution of dystrophic muscles in this case, each skeletal muscle was identified by dissection, examined and assigned one of three scores based on its gross appearance: 1-no grossly-detectable fat replacement, 2-partial fat replacement, and 3-complete fat replacement. Complete fat replacement was apparent as the presence of yellow fat within the fascial envelope that had contained the muscle and lacked muscle fiber remnants. Partial fat replacement was indicated when muscle fibers were interspersed with yellow fat, or the muscle body exhibited a lighter color and spongier texture than normal. Another form of partial fat replacement occurred where intact muscle fascicles were interrupted by zones of complete fat replacement. Differences in distribution of these muscle categories were tested statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA; p<0.05). Examples of gross observations and scoring categories are depicted in (top) and the gross findings for all examined muscles are tabulated in .\nA head-to-foot summary of gross findings is as follows. Gross changes in the musculature of the head, neck, oral and extraocular muscles were not observed. Muscles of the back largely showed partial, patchy fat infiltrate noticeable among the muscle fibers; these included the Latissimus dorsi, Rhomboids, Levator scapulae, and Erector spinae group (but not the Transversospinal group). Muscles of the anterior chest wall were unaffected (Intercostals, Transversus thoracis) as were some of the anterior abdominal wall (Rectus abdominis, Transversus abdominis) while External and Internal abdominal oblique muscles showed partial fat infiltration. Muscles of the proximal upper extremity were strongly affected, with the Pectoralis major/minor group showing complete fat transformation while all the others were partially affected. All muscles of the upper arm were partially fat-infiltrated while mixed effects between partial and unaffected were observed in the forearm musculature. In contrast, none of the intrinsic muscles of the hand showed gross dystrophic changes. The muscles of the lower extremity seemed more susceptible, with many of them completely replaced by fat. Such completely dystrophic muscles included the Gluteus, Obturator and Gemellus groups, the Iliacus, Quadratus femoris and the Tensor fascia lata. Muscles of the thigh appeared less profoundly affected, but all showed fat infiltration among intact muscle fascicles. In the leg, only the Gastrocnemius, Soleus and Fibularis longus showed partial fat infiltration, with the remainder appearing to be unaffected, as were all the intrinsic muscles of the foot.\nThese observations are summarized graphically by the whole-body muscle depiction in . Pseudohypertophy of the Gastrocnemius muscles was observed, as is apparent from the CT-scan shown in .\nAlso observed in dissection: the heart was large, but did not meet criteria for cardiomegaly, and both a pacemaker and a defibrillator were found. The diaphragm appeared normal/uninfiltrated and lungs appeared normal. The spleen was small (6 cm x 3 cm). The kidneys also seemed small for body size (right 9 cm long; left 10.5 cm long), but revealed a normal cortex and pelvic structure. This cadaver had thin-walled and dilated large intestines and megacolon, but all other gastrointestinal organs (pancreas, stomach, duodenum, liver) appeared normal. Five cholesterol gallstones (~1 cm3) were found in the gallbladder. The central nervous system (brain, spinal cord) was also grossly examined and judged normal. The peripheral nervous system was found grossly intact with no signs of thinning or atrophy in the brachial or lumbosacral plexii.\nStatistical analyses (graphed in ) indicates that proximal muscles were significantly (ANOVA, p<0.001) more affected than distal muscles in both upper and lower extremity, while axial muscles were largely unaffected. When sorted for laterality, little difference was observed between sides (ANOVA, not significant), indicating symmetric bilateral involvement and only 4 muscles showed categorically more fat infiltrate on the left side than the right: Flexor carpi ulnaris, Flexor digitorum profundus, Adductor brevis, Adductor magnus. Conversely, only the Extensor carpi radialis showed more fat infiltrate on the right side than the left. Anterior-posterior biases in dystrophic muscle distribution were also compared, but were not found to be statistically significant.\nBiopsies were collected from selected skeletal muscles (n=19) and visceral organs (n=12) for standard histological assessment. Post-mortem biopsy specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4 µm and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Photomicrographic images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with an Olympus DP72 camera. Within each image, the percentage of fat replacement was quantified by measuring relative cross-sectional areas (fat to fascicle area) using the Image processing program; multiple images of each sample were evaluated to determine a mean value. Representative histopathology samples are depicted in (bottom) and comparison of gross categorization and histologically-determined fat-replacement scores showed a general correspondence among their assessments (R2=0.35). The Pectoralis muscles (which had gross score = 3; total fat replacement) showed highest values (>95%) of fat replacement at the microscopic level; Rhomboids, Deltoid and Infraspinatus (gross score=2; partial) revealed 39%, 45% and 41% fat replacement, respectively. Adductor pollicis brevis, Lumbricals and Extensor hallicus brevis (gross score=1; no fat replacement) each showed lowest values (<5%). However, on microscopic analysis, some muscles showed measurable amounts of fat infiltrate when they did not appear to contain fat infiltrate at the gross level (Masseter = 28%; Medial rectus = 13%; Lateral rectus = 11%). A biopsy sample from the diaphragm showed minimal (<5%) fat replacement. Similarly, no fat infiltration was observed histologically in cardiac or viscera biopsies taken at gastrointestinal levels from mouth to anus.\nPrior to dissection, a full-body CT scan was obtained in one helical acquisition using a Siemens (Munich, Germany) Somatom Definition Flash CT scanner. Slice thickness was 0.6 mm, kV 140, and mA 280. Axial, sagittal, and coronal images were reconstructed with 5.0 mm slice thickness. The frontal CT image () revealed dispersed replacement of skeletal muscle with fat-density tissue. An axial CT image at the mid-chest level shows profound muscle loss in the region of the pectoral muscles but partial sparing of the serratus anterior and paraspinal muscles. The axial CT image at mid-pelvic level reveals fat replacement of the gluteal muscles with partial sparing of the musculature of the abdominal wall. The axial CT image at mid-thigh level indicates fatty replacement of the musculature in all compartments (anterior, posterior, and medial). Finally, the axial CT image at the mid-calf level depicts the extensive replacement of the posterior compartment musculature but partial sparing of the anterior compartment. Overall, the CT images indicate the selective but pervasive replacement of skeletal muscle with fat-density tissue, most prominently in areas of the proximal appendicular skeleton of the pectoral and gluteal regions. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

She was diagnosed with uterine fibroid since the first month of her pregnancy, but the pregnancy had been uneventful. She had history of weight loss (10 kg), no change in bowel habits, no hematemesis or rectal bleeding, and no history of hematuria or passing stones. The patient was using iron tablets; otherwise her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, she looked ill, markedly dehydrated, and drowsy. Her blood pressure was 126/76 mmHg, pulse rate 94 min–1, respiratory rate 30 min–1, and temperature 36.6°C; she had no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly, and no edema. Abdominal examination showed a uterus size of 40 weeks and tender epigastric area. Neurological examination showed a drowsy and hypotonic lady with brisk deep tendon reflexes. There was no obvious focal neurological sign. Planter reflexes were down-going. Chest and cardiovascular systems were unremarkable.\nThe findings of initial investigations were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dl, WBCs 7000 μl–1, platelets 445 000 μl–1; and ESR 109 mm/h. Peripheral blood smear showed toxic granulation of WBCs. Blood chemistry: BUN 4.4 mmol/l, creatinine 59 μmol/l, HCO3 22 mmol/l, Na 138 mmol/l, Ca 4.8 mmol/l (normal: 2.1-2.6), uric acid 508 μmol/l, lactic acid 1.2 mmol/l, and phosphorous 0.8 mmol/l. HIV serology was negative. A retrospective measurement of calcium at 14 weeks’ gestation was obtained at 2.43 mmol/l. Liver function test: ALT 4 u/l, AST 11 u/l, ALP 150 u/l, total protein 72 g/l, and albumen 30 g/l. Lipid profile: cholesterol 4.05 mmol/l and triglyceride 3.59 mmol/l. Hormone study: PTH 3 pg/ml (normal:15-65), TSH 0.68 mIU/l (normal: 0.45-4.5), free thyroxin 16.6 pmol/l (normal: 9-20), cortisol 1849 nmol/l, and vitamin D 15 ng/ml (normal: 30-80). Serum protein electrophoresis as well as serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal.\nIn consultation with the internist, the patient was given normal saline infusion at 250 ml/h with close monitoring of her urine output plus intramuscular calcitonin, and she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.\nBased on these laboratory findings, the possible diagnosis was humoral hypercalcemia of benignancy (uterine fibroid). PTH-rP is the primary mediator that causes hypercalcemia. However, we did not check for the PTH-rP level because of lack of facilities.\nIn the intensive care unit, the patient developed rupture membrane, which entailed urgent cesarean section while calcium remained high. However, because of hypercalcemia and reduction in the urine output with a rise in serum creatinine, the nephrologist was consulted for urgent hemodialysis before the operation. The surgery was complicated by bleeding, leading to hypotension requiring blood transfusion despite the successful delivery of a baby girl weighing 2.9 kg and removal of uterine masses measuring in aggregate 30 × 25 × 15 cm, which were submitted to a histopathological examination and the histopathology report was consistent with leiomyoma with calcifications but no evidence of malignancy. The postoperative clinical course was further complicated by septicemia and septic shock, which required vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nPostoperative laboratory test results were as follows: serum calcium 2.34 mmol/l, phosphorus 1.1 mmol/l, BUN 6.2 mmol/l, Cr 75 mmol/l, Na 143 mmol/l, K 4.2 mmol/l, HCO3 16 mEq/l, chloride 113 mEq/l, albumin 21 g/l, serum lactate 5.19, serum PTH 155 pg/ml, serum amylase 88 u/l, serum lipase 73 u/l; Hb 5.8 g/dl, platelets 125 000 μl1. The CT scan of the chest and pelvis showed no evidence of mass lesion or organomegaly. MRI of the brain that was done because of the deterioration in the level of consciousness showed evidence of infarcts involving the right cerebellum, the lentiform nucleus on both sides, as well as the cortical regions in frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. MRA revealed evidence of vasospasm of the internal carotid, the middle and the anterior carotid arteries; the findings are suggestive of diffuse ischemic changes secondary to hypoxic insult. Subsequently, her condition began to improve but her neurological status required extensive physiotherapy for the generalized muscle weakness and stiffness. The patient was discharged home, with a final diagnosis of humoral hypercalcemia associated with a uterine fibroid. Serum calcium remained within the normal range over the subsequent 6 months []. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 143.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 143.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 143.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 143.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 113.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (113.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 21.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 21.0 g albumin/10.0 dL = 2.1 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 21.0 g albumin/L converts to 2.1 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 14.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.1 (in g/dL)) = 18.75 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 18.75 mEq/L.",

His initial laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin level, 8.2 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.8%; platelet count, 180,000/μL, blood urea nitrogen level, 35.0 mg/dL; creatinine level, 5.18 mg/dL; troponin I level, 1.42 ng/mL; prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, 1.45; activated prothrombin time, 44.9 seconds; and C-reactive protein level, 8.6 mg/dL.\nThe patient’s vital signs in the operating room were stable. Local anesthesia was administered using 2% lidocaine, and a 20-G arterial catheter was inserted into the right radial artery. General anesthesia was then induced. We used etomidate at 0.2 mg/kg for sedation, sufentanil at 0.02 μg/kg/min for analgesia, and rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg for neuromuscular blockade. The patient had no history of cervical surgery and had not recently undergone insertion of a catheter into the IJV.\nAfter intubation, the patient was positioned to facilitate insertion of the AVA catheter () into the right IJV. In an effort to expand the right IJV, the head was lowered approximately 5 degrees and the face was pointed toward the left. The skin was aseptically prepared, the IJV was punctured with a needle tip under static ultrasound guidance with marking of anatomical landmarks, blood was aspirated, and a guidewire was inserted. The guidewire was inserted until it reached approximately 25 cm from the end of the syringe and was advanced no further to avoid arrhythmia. The presence of the guidewire within the IJV was confirmed by ultrasonography (). After a slight incision was made using a scalpel, the AVA catheter combined with a vessel dilator was advanced along the guidewire. No resistance was felt during entry of the dilator along the guidewire into the IJV. When the dilator was considered to have passed the IJV, the sheath was pushed forward; however, the dilator and guidewire were unable to be pulled backward. We assumed that the guidewire tip had become stuck to the vessel wall; therefore, we gently moved the dilator and guidewire back and forth in an attempt to loosen them. Despite these efforts, the dilator and guidewire were not removed simultaneously; instead, the guidewire was removed first, followed by the dilator. Upon pulling the guidewire out, we found that its end was bent and curved ().\nWe considered that the catheter was in the appropriate position despite the fact that the guidewire tip was twisted upon removal. We attempted to irrigate the vessel lumen with saline to remove air and prevent blood clot formation, but the blood was not regurgitated. We assumed that the sheath was malpositioned and thus repeated the ultrasound examination, which revealed that the AVA catheter sheath was folded inside the right IJV ().\nWe gently withdrew the AVA catheter to avoid additional injury. The AVA catheter was pulled out with no resistance, and the IJV was manually compressed for 5 minutes. We observed traces of small pleats in the end of the AVA catheter sheath, and we considered that they had been caused by folding and stretching of the end of the sheath upon removal. After removing the AVA catheter, we attempted to gain access to the left IJV. Left IJV catheterization using a new AVA catheter and subsequent performance of the operation were uneventful. At 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, we observed no tenderness, swelling, or color change at the right IJV catheterization site, and no further examination was performed thereafter.\nEthical permission was obtained from the Chonnam National University Hospital Institutional Review Board (CNUH-EXP-2017-283).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 43 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 5.18 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 165.0 cm, which is 165.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.65 m. The patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg / (1.65 m * 1.65 m) = 20.202 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.2, indicating they are normal weight. Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 55.0 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 43) * 55.0 * 1) / (5.18 * 72) = 14.304 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 14.304 mL/min.",

Clinical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal JVP, bibasilar rales and a very faint mid-diastolic murmur heard at the apex of the heart without an opening snap. Her ECG was normal. Chest X-ray showed no cardiomegaly but there was pulmonary congestion. In view of recurrent pulmonary edema in the absence of obvious causes for pulmonary edema and a long waiting for cardiologist consultation, a bedside transthoracic echocardiographic examination of the heart was performed using the ATL HDI 5000 machine to rule out any gross abnormalities in the heart. Bedside transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed a large rounded mass protruding from the left atrium into the left ventricle [Figures and ]. This mass was relatively fixed at mitral valve causing diastolic obstruction of mitral inflow and ‘functional’ mitral stenosis leading to recurrent pulmonary edema.

He endorsed 35 kg of weight loss over the prior 3 months and having had a high-carbohydrate meal the evening prior to presentation. The patient was not on medications prior to presentation and denied palpitations, heat intolerance, tremor, dyspnoea, oedema, anxiety, vision change, and change in bowel habit prior to presentation.\nOn exam, he was in moderate distress with a heart rate of 152 b.p.m., blood pressure of 89/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and temperature of 37.8°C. The patient had an otherwise unremarkable cardiovascular examination, including the absence of abnormal heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and lower extremity oedema. His lungs were clear to auscultation. The patient had moist mucous membranes and an enlarged thyroid but no evidence of exophthalmos, tremor, or ophthalmoplegia. He was found to have generalized weakness, predominantly in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies were notable for a potassium of 1.9 mEq/L (normal 3.7–5.2 mEq/L), an undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 of 3.2 ng/dL (normal 0.6–1.2 ng/dL). Initial ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with prolonged QT interval (QTc 652 ms) and minimal ST-elevations in V1–V3 (, top panel). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU).\nHis weakness improved following potassium repletion and fluid resuscitation, but his tachycardia persisted. A second ECG was obtained and notable for anteroseptal (V1–V4) ST-elevations and resolution of QT prolongation (QTc 401 ms) (, bottom panel). He denied chest pain or pressure. Troponin-I was elevated to 7.97 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL), trending upwards to 18.98 ng/mL.\nTreatment was initiated with aspirin, ticagrelor, and unfractionated heparin infusion. He was unable to acutely tolerate beta-blockade due to hypotension. Urgent echocardiogram () revealed a severely dilated left ventricle [left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) 114 mL/m2] with severely reduced systolic function [ejection fraction (EF) 23%] and global hypokinesis. No focal wall-motion abnormalities were present.\nFollowing initiation of propylthiouracil, potassium iodine solution, and stress-dosed steroids, his tachycardia and ST-elevations improved. Computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography () 2 days after presentation demonstrated no evidence of coronary artery atherosclerosis or stenosis. Additionally, cine cardiac CT images of the heart showed normal left ventricular systolic function (, Videos S). Aspirin, ticagrelor, and heparin were stopped at this time due to a low concern for type I MI. Thyrotropin receptor antibodies returned positive, consistent with Graves’ disease. Ultrasound of the thyroid gland showed thyromegaly (right lobe volume 32 cc, left lobe volume 26 cc) with heterogenous parenchyma and increased vascularity, also consistent with Graves’ disease. Prior to discharge, the patient endorsed improved but persistent fatigue and dyspnoea with exertion. He continued to be free of chest pain and remained normotensive throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. The patient was discharged on methimazole in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, including lisinopril 2.5 mg daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. Up-titration of his lisinopril and metoprolol dosages were limited by borderline-low blood pressures. He appeared euvolemic throughout the hospitalization, so diuretics were not initiated. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were not prescribed upon discharge due to borderline hypotension, as well.\nAt 2-month follow-up, the patient’s left ventricle remained severely dilated (LVEDVi 126 mL/m2) but with recovered systolic function (EF 65%) (). He had returned to normal activities without functional limitations. He was initially continued on lisinopril and metoprolol, but both were eventually discontinued over the course of several months given the patient’s recovered left ventricular systolic function and successful treatment of his hyperthyroidism. He remained on methimazole and was clinically euthyroid on follow-up visits. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

She had a history of intraarticular injection of cortisone in the right knee 3 days before the admission. Her physical examination revealed erythema of the right lower limb with edema on palpation. The medical history of the patient was notable for severe aortic stenosis (estimated surface 1 cm2) with multiple episodes of hemodynamic pulmonary edema, for which the patient had refused any intervention; hypertension; type 2 diabetes mellitus; and a hiatal hernia. Her chronic treatment consisted of amlodipine, aspirin, olmesartan, furosemide, metformin, and omeprazole.\nBlood testing conducted while the patient was in the emergency room showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 47.5 g/L (normal <1 g/L), a bicarbonate level of 24 mmol/L (normal 22-30 mmol/L), and a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dl (normal 12–15 g/dl). Analysis of her knee fluid revealed the presence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, for which she was treated with intravenous flucloxacillin (2 g six times per day), oral rifampicin (600 mg every day), and intravenous acetaminophen (1 g four times per day). Ten days after her admission, she developed encephalopathy associated with arterial hypotension at 70/50 mmHg that did not respond to crystalloid administration. The patient was transferred to the ICU, and blood gas analysis at her admission revealed increased anion gap metabolic acidosis with no elevated lactate level (pH 7.17, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide [PaCO2] 11.2 mmHg, partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] 122 mmHg, lactate 1.22 mmol/L).\nBlood work conducted at the patient’s ICU admission confirmed that she had acidosis. She had a bicarbonate level of 4 mmol/L, a chloride concentration of 119 mmol/L, a sodium concentration of 145 mmol/L, and a potassium concentration of 3.6 mmol/L. The calculated anion gap was high at 22 (normal 8–12). The patient’s plasma osmolality was 283 mOsm/kg. Common causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, such as lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, ingestion of toxic substances, and renal failure, were ruled out The patient’s blood glucose level was 174 mg/dl, and her renal function was normal (creatinine 0.87 mg/dl, normal 0.5–1.2 mg/dl; plasma urea 31 mg/dl, normal 17–42 mg/dl). A search for blood and urine ketones returned negative results, and the test results for levels of methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol by headspace gas chromatography and for levels acetylsalicylic acid with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were also negative. There was no indication of elevated D-lactate levels. In the context of treatment with flucloxacillin and acetaminophen, as well as the presence of severe sepsis, metabolic acidosis by accumulation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by GC-MS analysis of urinary pyroglutamate (9789 mmol/mmol creatinine, normal level <14 mmol/mol creatinine).\nThe treatment consisted of stopping any medication that inhibits 5-oxoprolinase and causes glutathione deficiency. We replaced flucloxacillin with co-trimoxazole, which does not affect this enzyme. We also stopped the administration of acetaminophen and gave an infusion of acetylcysteine to replenish the patient’s glutathione stores.\nThe patient’s condition evolved favorably, and she was allowed to leave the ICU 8 days later. A blood gas sample taken at discharge showed regression of the metabolic acidosis (pH 7.53, PaCO2 21.7 mmHg, PaO2 80.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 18 mmol/L, calculated anion gap 8) and regression of the inflammatory syndrome (CRP 3.1 g/dl).

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 145.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 145.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 145.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 145.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 145.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 145.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 119.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 119.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 119.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 119.0 mEq chloride.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 4.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 4.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 4.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 4.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 145.0 mEq/L - (119.0 mEq/L + 4.0 mEq/L) = 22.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 22.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 22.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 22.0 - 12 = 10.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 10.0 mEq/L.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 48-year old woman (weight 52 kg, height 152 cm, ASA II) was admitted in Sept 18th 2016 because of a ground glass opacity (GGO) which had been detected in the right lung 2 years ago. She had her left pneumonectomy through uniportal VATS owing to the left upper lobe adenocarcinoma invasive to the left main bronchus in Mar 2014. Her pre-operative diagnoses were GGO in the right upper lobe, suspect for malignancy and left postpneumonectomy (Fig. ). No abnormal findings were detected among other tests, and some of the important figures in the arterial blood gas test were showed as follows: pH 7.44, PaCO2 37 mmHg, PaO2 84 mmHg, SaO2 97.7%. Her pulmonary function test showed FEV1 46.9%, FEV1/FVC 83.3%, and her predicted postoperative FEV1% would be close to 44.7%. Although other tests of evaluating cardiopulmonary reserve function and lung parenchymal function were not performed, her regular 3-floor climbing activity was not compromised. The operation was scheduled as right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal VATS under general anesthesia. Routine monitoring was applied and the first data were recorded as follows: body temperature 36.7 °C, blood pressure 123/70 mmHg, heart rate 86/min and Sp02 98% when the patient was placed in a supine position in the operation room. After the insertion of an 18-gauge intravenous cannula and the right internal jugular vein catheter, intravenous induction was carried out with an injection of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.6 μg/kg, propofol 1 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg. Intubation preparation: the patient was scheduled to have the right anterior segmentectomy through VATS after the left pneumonectomy, which entailed us to make a good balance between ventilation and collapse on the right lung only, to make good use of ventilation in the lower and middle lobes, and to produce an effective collapse in the upper lobar. After a prudent study of the following parameters, the diameter of the narrowest part of the tracheal is 11.9 mm, the length of right upper lobe bronchus is 6.2 mm, the angle of the right main bronchus and right upper lobe bronchus is close to 90 degree, the diameter of the bronchus intermedius is 8.8 mm, and the length of bronchus intermedius is about 15 mm, a 32 Fr left-sided DLT was chosen and adapted (Fig. ). Permission was granted by our hospital ethical committee to adapt the DLTs. The cutting edge of the tube should be smooth and clean, only in this way can we make sure that it won’t do any harm to the airways. One cut (cut just for once) would be best in adapting. Whether the cutting edge is qualified or not can be detected by our sensitive finger tips. And this technique has been proved safe from our experience in tracheal and bronchial operations. The 32Fr left-sided DLTs have been used among short women for left thoracic operations in our facility, and its external diameter is about 10.7 mm, the bronchial internal diameter is about 3.5 mm. But it’s our first time to insert the left-sided DLT to the right for the right lung surgery. As we can see from Fig. , the mediastinum has shifted to the left, the intubation should be gentle and carried out by an experienced anesthesiologist in case of any possible injury or even perforation to the former carina. After induction, we performed a FOB (3.0 mm diameter) guided endobronchial intubation with the bronchial cuff into the right bronchus intermedius, and the tracheal cuff’s orifice up against the upper bronchial port (Fig. ), in this way, the ventilation of the dependent right middle and lower lobes and the collapse of the upper lobar were guaranteed (Fig. ), thus an appropriate balance between surgical field and oxygenation was achieved, and the blood and sputum from the upper lobe bronchial port can be sucked out. An automatic infusion of propofol and sufentanil combined with manual administration of rocuronium maintained the anesthesia for the operation. And a lung protective mechanical ventilation strategy was taken, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, tidal volume (Vt) 4–6 ml/kg, frequency 15–18/min. In the meantime, end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded to adjust ventilation. The lung recruitment, air leak test and sputum suction went well throughout the operation and the surgery was completed as planned. The patient recovered well after the surgery, so she was extubated in the operation room and sent to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for transition, where a routine oxygen supplementation was applied. Oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation were all strictly monitored and no adverse events were recorded in the PACU.

    "problem": "<Context> History of present illness\nA 25-year-old African American female with no known past medical history or psychiatric history was brought to the hospital by her mother due to changes in her behavior (nervousness, sweating, lack of sleep) and palpitation. The patient experienced auditory and visual hallucinations (yelled at people she alone could see to keep them away from her). The patient's mother stated that she thought the patient was suicidal when she heard her saying, \"I am going to die,\" prompting her to call 911. However, there was no evidence of suicidality at this time. The patient's mother reported the patient's occasional use of cannabis and alcohol. At the emergency room (ER), a diagnosis of anxiety was made, and she was treated and discharged home on hydroxyzine 25 mg every six hours. However, her symptoms persisted and even worsened despite compliance with medications. She spent the next two days in her room, unable to sleep, anxious, and repeating the exact words, \"you are going to be okay.\" Her anxiety worsened and became more agitated warranting readmission and an extensive workup that included anti-NMDA receptor antibodies showing an NMDA titer of 1:320 in her CSF and confirming anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. IV steroids, plasma exchange, and rituximab were then administered during this patient's long hospital stay. She completed numerous lab tests, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG), which were negative. She was then discharged home for later follow-up visits.\nAfter two days, she returned to the hospital with a report of worsening combativeness, confusion, and aggression at home. She exhibited suicidal behaviors, including possessing a razor blade to hurt herself and overdosing on a handful of unspecified medications. NMDA titers were repeated and showed increased levels of 1:1280. IV immunoglobulins (IVIG) and intravenous methylprednisolone and rituximab were repeated. She was later transferred to a higher level care center due to the concern of no improvement in her aggression and combativeness with new features of catatonia, including mutism, sitting abnormally still, staring, catalepsy, waxy flexibility, occasional impulsivity, and occasional aggression. At this center, she received lorazepam for 10 days with no significant improvement in her symptoms and was then commenced on emergency ECT treatment. Catatonia due to another medical condition was considered during the patient's treatment course. The differential diagnoses considered during her treatment were hepatitis B virus, primary central nervous system vasculitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and hypersensitivity to first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol. The possibility of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered in this patient given the sociodemographic and symptomatic profile but the physicians who managed this patient did not consider her as having SLE.\nExamination\nDuring the assessment, the patient was alert and mute but followed simple commands and nodded yes/no in response to questions. Pupils were equal and reactive to light; she blinked to threat in all visual fields. Intact extraocular movements without nystagmus or ptosis were observed. Her facial sensations were intact and symmetric to light touch on the V1-V3 distribution. Her face was symmetric with a smile and tight eye closure. Uvula and palate rose midline. Shoulder shrug/head turns were symmetric with 5/5 strength. The tongue was midline with no protrusion. There was an increased tone in all her four extremities but no abnormal movements. Strength in all extremities was ⅗, and reflexes of 2+ were present symmetrically in her biceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles. However, she exhibited catatonic features, which lasted from minutes to hours. Her Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was 13 (1 for mobility, 3 for mutism, 2 for staring, 1 for posturing, 3 for waxy flexibility, 1 for impulsivity, 1 for combativeness).\nMental status examination revealed a young lady, well-groomed, with casual wear. She was cooperative and calm. She exhibited minimal psychomotor retardation with a lack of movement. Her speech was slow, with a latency of about 5 seconds. Her affect was flat and mood dysphoric. She was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, person, and event. Her thought process was linear and concrete. Her judgment and insight were fair.\nInvestigation\nThe following investigations were completed during her latest hospital stay. Complete metabolic panel showed; sodium 137 meq/l (normal range: 135 - 148 meq/l), potassium 4.4 meq/l (normal range: 3.5 - 5.3 meq/l), chloride 102 meq/l (normal range: 98 - 107 meq/l), Co2 28 meq/l (normal range: 22 - 29 meq/l), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dl (normal range: 6 - 20 mg/dl), serum glucose 100 mg/dl (normal range: 70 - 110 mg/dl), blood creatinine 0.9 mg/dl (normal range: 0.57 - 1.11 mg/dl), calcium 9.1 mg/dl (normal range: 8.5 - 10.5 mg/dl), anion gap 7 meq/l (normal range: 5 - 13 meq/l), BUN/creatinine ratio 18 (normal range: 10 - 20). Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) 17.55 103/ul (normal range: 4.6 - 10.2 103/ul), RBC 4.77 106/ul (normal range: 4.04 - 5.48 106/ul), hemoglobin 11.9 g/dl (normal range: 12.2 - 16.2 g/dl), hematocrit 37.6% (normal range: 37.7 - 47.9%), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 78.8 fl (normal range: 80 - 97 fl), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 24.9 pg (normal range: 27.0 - 31.2 pg), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 31.6 g/dl (normal range: 31.8 - 35.4 g/dl), platelet count 508 X 103/ul (normal range: 142.0 - 424.0 X 103/ul), mean platelet volume (MPV) 10.2 fl (normal range: 9.4 - 12.4 fl), red cell distribution width (RDW) 17.3% (normal range: 11.6 - 14.6%). Thyriod stimulating hormone (TSH) was 1.03 mIU/L (0.5 to 5.0 mIU/L). The hepatitis B viral panel showed a negative hepatitis B surface antigen and positive hepatitis B core antibody. Malignancy work-up, including transvarginal ultrasound and pelvic MRI, was negative for any malignancy ruling out ovarian teratoma. There were no suspicious adnexal masses.\nAnti-NMDAR antibodies were positive at the most recent visit with a serum NMDA titer increase to 1:1280 from the previous 1:320 at the initial diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis. A brain MRI showed no mass lesion, hemorrhage, or acute infarct. There was no leptomeningeal or intraparenchymal enhancement (Figure ). The ventricular system, cisterns, and sulci were of normal size, shape, and contour. EEG showed normal findings. Other imaging investigations done were CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, all of which showed no primary malignancy or metastatic lesion.\nTreatment\nAt her initial visit, after the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, she received intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and intravenous methylprednisolone. However, when the NMDA titer was found to be elevated, the decision was made to repeat IVIG, intravenous methylprednisolone, and add rituximab. She received IVIG 2 g/kg over five days, was continued on rituximab and IVIG 1 g. Haloperidol 5 mg three times daily, memantine 5 mg daily, clonazepam 1 mg three times daily, and gabapentin. During her hospitalization, she had extensive long-term electroencephalographic monitoring that did not disclose any seizure activity.\nFurther immunotherapies were considered. The patient received a third dose of rituximab and was started on prednisone 60 mg daily. Due to concerns for catatonia, lorazepam 2 mg every six hours was commenced and titrated to a high dose. Because she had only a minimal response, amantadine 100 mg twice a day was added. Nonetheless, these treatments proved to be of limited benefit, as the patient remained symptomatic while on admission for about 10 days. An emergent ECT was performed, and she subsequently had 12 ECT sessions, after which her BFCRS score decreased to 0 with significant improvement in her catatonia, cognitive function, and overall mental status. The patient was started on a prolonged prednisone taper and was later discharged on 40 mg four times daily, with instructions on tapering it down.

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 28.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 7.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 7.0 - 12 = -5.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -5.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -5.0 mEq/L / -4.0 mEq/L = 1.25. The patient's delta ratio is 1.25.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 43-yr-old female visited a nearby hospital because of abnormal shadows including multiple nodules and reticular shadows on chest radiography found at an annual medical checkup in 2005. A bronchoscopic examination was performed. They were unable to obtain a biopsy specimen from one of the nodules in S10 of the left lung because the patient had a strong bleeding tendency. She was referred to this hospital for further examination on June 30, 2005.\nOn admission, her height was 157.5 cm and weight, 50.3 kg. Her consciousness was clear. The conjunctivas were anemic and not jaundiced. Her heart sounds were normal. Fine crackles were audible in the right lower lung field. The abdomen was not distended. Her inguinal lymph nodes were palpable and no other superficial lymph nodes were palpable. She was experiencing slight polyarthralgia, however, radiography films showed no joint anomalies.\nThe laboratory data were: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 119 mm/1 hr; white cell count, 8,900/µL; hemoglobin, 8.4 g/dL; platelet count, 39.4×104/µL; serum aspartate aminotransferase, 22 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 22; total protein, 9.7 g/dL; albumin 2.6; creatinine, 0.48; PT, 13.1 sec (INR 1.45); aPTT, 39.6 (control, 10.4); fibrinogen, 750 mg/dL; KL-6, 277 U/mL (reference range <500); C-reactive protein, 11.7 mg/dL (<0.3); serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G, 4,570 (870-1740); IgA, 491(110-400), IgM, 706 (35-220), CH50, 52.3 U/mL (30-50), soluble IL-2 receptor, 1,400; serum IL-6, 6.8 pg/mL (<4); rheumatoid factor (RF), 1,330 IU/mL (<20). Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody, anti-ds-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and myeloperoxidase-ANCA were all negative. M-protein was not noted in serum immunoelectrophoresis. Bone marrow aspiration showed hyperplasia with no abnormal morphology on smear specimens.\nChest radiographys showed multiple nodules and reticular shadows mainly in the lower lung field. Chest CT scan disclosed a slight enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes, centrilobular nodules, thin-walled cysts, the thickening of the bronchovascular bundles, and ground-grass opacities, all of these findings were compatible with those of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP; ) (, ). 67Gallium citrate scintigraphy did not reveal any evident accumulation.\nA lung surgeon and a thoracic physician declined to perform a lung biopsy because of her bleeding tendency (bleeding time: 6 min 30 sec) and poor general condition. A biopsy of an inguinal lymph node was obtained for making a definite diagnosis (). She was diagnosed with MCD and undifferentiated arthritis based on the characteristic pathology of the specimen of the inguinal lymph node, CT findings of the bilateral lung lesions and laboratory data.\nShe was initially administered intravenous corticosteroid (methylprednisolone, 500 mg/day, 3 consecutive days) followed by oral corticosteroid (methylprednisolone, 16 mg/day), and, 375 mg/m2 rituximab every week for 4 weeks. The polyarthralgia instantly disappeared; however, none of the other clinical and laboratory parameters were fully resolved. Therefore the therapeutic regimen was changed to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, every 2 weeks), oral corticosteroid (methylprednisolone, 16 mg/day) on October 25, 2005. The patient requested that the interval between tocilizumab to be increased to more than every two weeks. The dose of corticosteroid in combination with tocilizumab should be kept as low as possible to avoid various side effects, such as osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. It is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Japan. The addition of tacrolimus to the regimen was considered to fulfill such requirements. Both the possible merits and demerits of the drug were explained to the patient and her oral consent was obtained. Tacrolimus (3 mg/day) was introduced on November 10, 2005. Laboratory findings, including anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and an increase in acute phase proteins responded to this regimen (). The enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes and abnormal shadows were also partially alleviated (). The intervals of the tocilizumab-administration sessions were extended from every 2 weeks to every 3 weeks from January 2006. Oral corticosteroid was gradually tapered from 16 mg/day finally to 4 mg/day. The dose of tacrolimus has been unchanged. The disease activity has been totally suppressed for 36 months by this maintenance regimen. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 40-year-old Japanese man experienced periumbilical pain since November 2013, and although the symptoms were mild, they were prolonged. He visited his family physician in January 2014, who noted mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan. CT revealed a low-density mass that measured 43 × 40 mm in size in the left abdomen. He was referred to the National Hospital Organization Tsuruga Medical Center in February. His past medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, the patient had a height of 179.0 cm, a body weight of 98.7 kg, and a body mass index (BMI) of 30.8 and did not present with anemia, icterus, edema, or malnutrition. His abdomen was flat and soft, with mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant on palpation; however, the mass could not be felt.\nThe laboratory results showed no abnormalities in his blood cell counts; however, an elevation in the serum alanine transaminase (ALT; 60 IU/L), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GTP; 108 IU/L), total bilirubin (T-Bil; 1.31 mg/dL), and total cholesterol (T-Chol; 229 mg/dL) levels was observed. The levels of epithelial tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 2.1 ng/mL), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9; 8.7 U/mL), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125; 11 U/mL), were within normal limits.\nThe patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT examination 2 weeks after the CT examination conducted by his family physician because in the previous examination, the patient had not been administered a contrast agent. A low-density mass with an irregular outline and measuring 45 × 42 mm in size was detected in the left abdomen at the slightly cranial level of his umbilicus in the plain phase (Fig. ). The tumor was located in the peripheral part of the mesentery of the jejunum and partly compressed the adjacent jejunum. In the enhanced phase, the tumor lacked contrast. The peripheral artery was shown to be involved, indicating that the tumor developed in the mesentery of the jejunum; however, the adjacent jejunum showed good enhancement (Fig. ). The oral side of the jejunum did not show dilatation. A lymphatic cyst diagnosis was highly suspected.\nThe patient’s abdominal symptom passed without exacerbation, and a follow-up examination was conducted in March. One month later, he underwent a scheduled CT examination, and the mass did not appear to have increased in size (Fig. a). Enhancement revealed apparent invasion of the wall of the jejunum without ischemia of the adjacent jejunum or dilatation of the oral side of the bowel (Fig. b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intermediate intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) (Fig. ) and high intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) (Fig. ). Relatively low intensity was observed with enhancement using gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) contrast medium on T1WI (Fig. ). An accumulation of cystic lesions with a variety of sizes was clearly depicted on the coronal view on T2WI (Fig. ).\nBecause it was expected that depiction of the tumor would be made somewhat more difficult by its location and the body shape of the patient, we conducted a sonography examination in reference to the location and properties of the tumor determined by CT and MRI. The lesion showed a low echo; however, a clear image was not obtained.\nCT performed by the previous physician and at our institution showed that the tumor was located in the peripheral part of the jejunal mesentery and exhibited slight enteric compression without dilatation of the oral jejunum but no rapid increase in size. The patient hesitated to agree to an immediate operation but did agree to a 1-month observation period. Permeation of the jejunal wall was shown by a second CT examination at our institution performed 1 month later, and from these findings, we highly suspected that the lymphangioma was invading the jejunal wall and thus decided to perform surgery.\nWe made a preoperative diagnosis of lymphangioma invading the jejunal wall, and with the patient’s informed consent, we performed an operation to relieve his symptoms and obtain a definitive diagnosis of the tumor in April.\nThe patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. Small incisions were made along the superior and inferior border of the umbilicus and connected through the bottom of the umbilicus with an S-shape. The length of the wound was approximately 5 cm. We placed the Lapprotector™ (Model FF0707; Hakko Co., Ltd., Medical Device Division, Japan) in the umbilical wound and then attached the E·Z Access™ device (E·Z Access for FF07; Hakko Co., Ltd., Medical Device Division, Japan). A 12-mm trocar was placed through the E·Z Access device, and pneumoperitoneum was established with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas at 8 mmHg of pressure. An accessory trocar (5 mm) was placed on the right side of the 12-mm trocar through the E·Z Access device. Using forceps, we removed the omentum from the small intestinal front and found a soft yellowish mass in the mesentery of the jejunum that had invaded the wall of the jejunum (Fig. ). We removed the tumor from the body through the umbilical wound, resected the surrounding mesentery and part of the jejunum, and performed anastomosis in a functional end-to-end manner (Fig. ). The total operative duration was 94 min, and the intraoperative blood loss volume was 30 ml.\nMacroscopically, the external surface of the mass had a whitish-yellowish and lobulated appearance. The tumor protruded from both sides of the mesentery leaves and was surrounded by the mesenteric peritoneum. The tumor measured 50 × 45 mm in size and was located in the peripheral part of the mesentery and adjacent to the jejunum (Fig. ). The small intestinal mucosal surface formed a hemispherical uplift approximately 24 × 20 mm in size adjacent to the mesenteric lesion without contraction (Fig. ). The cut surface of the mass after fixation by formalin revealed multicystic lesions of various sizes containing a café-au-lait-colored milky fluid similar to chyle (Fig. ). Histologically, the cyst wall showed an attenuated endothelial lining, surrounding rich adipose tissue and scattered smooth muscle fibers (Fig. ). In addition, small lymphoid aggregates also appeared focally. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the flat endothelial cells associated with the cysts were positive for the endothelial markers CD31 (Fig. ) and factor VIII-related antigen (Fig. ), partially positive for the lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 (Fig. ) and the undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell marker CD34 (Fig. ), and negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (Fig. ) and the mesothelial marker calretinin (Fig. ). Dilated lymphatic ducts were observed in the tumorous lesion of the mesentery and adjacent to this lesion in the muscularis propria and submucosal layer of the small intestine. In the wall of the jejunum without tumor invasion, dilation of the lymphatic ducts was not observed. These findings were consistent with cystic lymphangioma.\nThe patient recovered successfully and was discharged from the hospital 9 days after the operation. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of palpitations due to drug-refractory AF to undergo RFCA. She underwent a total right lung excision due to bronchiectasia at an age of 23 years old. Her physical examination and laboratory analysis yielded no abnormalities. Her 12 lead electrocardiogram exhibited normal sinus rhythm, but a counter clockwise rotation (Figure A). Her echocardiograms yielded no evidence of clinically overt structural and/or organic heart disease including right ventricular dysfunction and dilation, and pulmonary hypertension, and a normal ejection fraction of 70% and left atrial (LA) dimension of 30 mm. Her chest X-ray (Figure B) and computed tomography (CT) (Figure C) revealed a severely right-sided dislocation of the heart. The CT also revealed that the area of the atrial septum was small and parallel in the 40° left anterior oblique (LAO) view and perpendicular to the 50° right anterior oblique (RAO) view (Figure C). Thus, before the transseptal puncture, right atriography was performed in those views (Figure A,B). A temperature probe (SensiTherm™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) for monitoring the esophageal temperature and a guidewire were inserted and placed between the level of the left superior and inferior pulmonary veins (PVs) and in the ascending aorta, respectively. Then, a double transseptal puncture was carefully performed under guidance of an intracardiac echogram (Ultra ICE catheter; EP Technologies, Boston Scientific Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) (Figure C). After an open irrigated 3.5-mm-tip ablation catheter (FlexAbility™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) and circular mapping catheter (Optima™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) were positioned in the LA, the LA was reconstructed by a 3D mapping system (EnSite NavX/Velocity™ Cardiac Mapping System, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA). The left atriography (Figure D) and EnSite voltage map (Figure E,F) revealed that the right PVs had a blind edge, but had PV potentials. The left PVs’ stenosis or occlusion might be fatal complication in this present case. Thus, to prevent those complications, a circumferential PVAI was performed and the radiofrequency energy did not deliver in the PV, especially left PVs, under electroanatomic guidance with the 3D mapping system (Figure H,I) until the achievement of bidirectional conduction block between the LA and PVs under the administration of isoproterenol (Figure G). Because the run of the phrenic nerve was unknown, the procedure was performed while confirming the diaphragmatic movement by fluoroscopy. Because firing from the superior vena cava (SVC) was induced under an intravenous administration of isoproterenol, an SVC isolation was additionally performed. Then, program stimulation could no longer induce any arrhythmias including AF. She has remained well without any symptoms or medications for 1 year after the RFCA. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

His body weight was 60 kg and height was 169 cm. He was previously healthy, but a smoker (10 cigarettes a day for 40 years) without drug abuse and remarkable family history. Physical examination revealed axillary temperature of 37°C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 106 bpm, respiratory rate 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. He was drowsy without nausea or vomiting. Glasgow coma scale score was 15. Blood routine showed that white blood cell count was 15.63 × 109/L. Thoracic computerized tomography which was taken a day before the surgery revealed bullae and low attenuation area in bilateral lower lobes []. Written consent of publishing of this paper was obtained from the patient when he was discharged.\nThe patient was positioned supine in the operating room. Anesthesia was managed with etomidate, fentanyl, propofol, remifentanil, and cisatracurium. After successful intubation on one attempt, chest auscultation revealed bilateral equal breath sounds without rales or wheezing. Vital volume was set at 450 mL and respiratory rate 12 bpm without positive end-expiratory pressure. The central vein was not punctured or catheterized. During surgery, the artery aneurysm was clipped with Sugita Titanium Aneurysm Clip (17-001-86, MIZUHO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The surgery lasted for 3 h and finished uneventfully without awakening the patient during the surgery. There was no blood transfusion. A total of 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution was given. Urine output was 300 mL.\nThe spontaneous breath was back 10 min after the surgery, so mechanical ventilation was stopped. Twenty min later, the patient developed a sudden dry cough without consciousness or extubation. Soon after the cough, oxygen saturation began to decline, so assisted ventilation was intermittently used to keep oxygen saturation more than 90%. In the meantime, subcutaneous emphysema was noted over his neck and chest. His blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm. A bolus of 50 mg propofol was given intravenously. Diminished breath sounds were detected in the left lung on auscultation. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate began to decrease. A thoracic surgeon was invited for consultation immediately and arrived 10 min later. After physical examination, needle aspiration was performed under local anesthesia in the left midaxillary line and in the fifth intercostal space, and then a large of tensioned air was immediately released, so tube thoracostomy was undergone at the same site. The procedures were followed by immediate improvement in oxygen saturation. During the whole period, heart rate was once decreased to 40 bpm, so a total of 1 mg atropine was administered intravenously and blood pressure was reduced to 70/40 mmHg, so 10 mg dopamine was given. No tear of the trachea or endotracheal tube obstruction was found under fiberoptic bronchoscopy. When his status was stable, the patient was taken to take cerebral and thoracic computerized tomography scan with oxygen supplementation. The thoracic computerized tomography demonstrated bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and chest []. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.\nTwo days later, the patient was sober and extubated. His oxygen saturation was around 95% with oxygen administration by a venturi mask. Oxygen saturation could be kept above 95% on room air on the next day. The intercostal tube was removed on postoperative day 12. Follow-up chest radiograph on postoperative day 13 showed resolved pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum with residual subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and left chest wall [].

Her blood tests revealed a lactate of 7.2 mmol/L, which worsened to 7.8 mmol/L during resuscitation with intravenous fluids, and white cell count was 30.9 × 109/L, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4. She had an acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 119μmol/L and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 43 mL/min/1.73m2. Computed tomography (CT) revealed extensive thickened loops of non-enhancing small bowel with pneumatosis, moderate free fluid and a large splenic infarction. There was extensive thrombosis of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein extending into the portal vein to the level of the porta hepatis. Her background history included factor V Leiden and protein S deficiency, for which she had been non-compliant with warfarin during this illness. She had no surgical history (–).\nAfter initial assessment and fluid resuscitation, she was given broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and proceeded to emergent laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included an 80-cm segment of ischaemic jejunum, which was resected, with a laparostomy performed and transferred to the ICU. During laparotomy, a small 1.5-cm mass was observed arising from the antimesenteric border of the ischaemic segment, presumed to be a jejunal diverticulum and was included within the specimen. Peritoneal survey revealed splenic infarction but otherwise no other observed organ injury. She was noted to have a dusky-appearing right foot with no palpable peripheral pulse; however, arterial Doppler revealed midperoneal, posterior tibial and anterior tibial arterial stenoses, suggesting ischaemia due to a low-flow state. She was commenced on intravenous heparin. She returned to theatre 36 h later, at which time no further ischaemia was encountered, and anastomosis was performed and the abdomen subsequently closed. She recovered over a period of 1 week and was discharged home on warfarin.\nSubsequent pathology revealed an incidental 45-mm, ulcerated spindle cell tumour, with immunohistochemistry in keeping with a smooth muscle tumour. A subsequent second-opinion pathology report supports the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma of the small bowel, with the tumour being strongly positive for desmin and h-caldesmon and negative for c-kit, DOG-1, S100, MelanA, SOX10, HMB45, CD34, AE1/AE3 and CK8/18. The mitotic index was 9 mitoses/mm2. Staging CT of the chest revealed an 11-mm pretracheal lymph node, which did not show fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on PET scan.

At the age of 35, he had proteinuria and was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and kidney injury. He was diagnosed with possible membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) based on the results of a renal biopsy (see below). His systolic blood pressure was kept in control within 125–140 mmHg. The patient's medications included amlodipine, carvedilol, furosemide, doxazosin, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. He had no history of smoking or any other toxic habits. His parents and siblings had been free from strokes, migraines, and dementia.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 160/82 mmHg and his pulse rate was 62 beats/min and regular. He was alert and did not have any mood disorder, migraines, scalp alopecia, or spinal osteoarthritis. A neurological examination showed left facial palsy, dysarthria, and dysphagia (pseudobulbar palsy). The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 27 of 30.\nPeripheral blood cell counts and biochemical studies showed moderate anemia (hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; hematocrit, 28.7%), impaired kidney function (blood urea nitrogen, 69 mg/dL; creatinine, 3.63 mg/dL; urinary protein excretion, 1.04 g/day), dyslipidemia (LDL-cholesterol, 89 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 32 mg/dL; triglycerides, 183 mg/dL), and hyperhomocysteinemia (24.5 nmol/mL). No abnormality was detected in his antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, fibrinogen, d-dimer, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.\nCerebral MRI demonstrated diffuse T2 hyperintense areas in the periventricular and subcortical white matter involving bilateral temporal poles and the external capsule (). On diffusion-weighted images, a hyperintense area was observed at the right frontal lobe, indicating a recent infarct. T2*-weighted images showed multiple microbleeds in the bilateral basal ganglia and subcortical areas. MR angiograms did not show any abnormal findings.\nSince he had severe white matter lesions, including the temporal pole, which is characteristic of CADASIL [], we performed a mutational analysis of the NOTCH3 gene after he provided informed consent. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient. Polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-) mediated direct sequencing demonstrated that no mutation was found in exons 3 and 4, which are hot spots in CADASIL. Then, we examined all other exons and splice sites of the NOTCH3 gene, and G to C transversion was detected in exon 24, c.4039G>C. It changed the codon 1347 from GGG to CGG, resulting in a p.Gly1347Arg substitution (). The DNA mutation numbering is based on the cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM_000435.2), with +1 corresponding to the A of the translational initiation site. The patient was heterozygous for this missense mutation. We did not find any other mutations or splice variants. The c.4039G>C change was absent in the database of common gene variations in the Japanese population (JSNP), in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database of the NCBI, and in 30 unrelated Japanese controls, who were examined after providing consent according to the ethics code of the Kyushu University Hospital.\nThe p.Gly1347Arg substitution was present in the EGF-like repeat domain 34 of the Notch3 extracellular domain. According to in silico analysis, this substitution was predicted to be “probably damaging” with a score of 0.999 using polymorphism phenotyping-2 (PolyPhen-2, ) [], and it was also predicted to be “deleterious” with a score of −4.930 as determined by Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN, ) [], thus indicating an adverse effect on the structure and function of the protein.\nThe renal biopsy specimens that had been obtained 28 years earlier showed mesangial cell proliferation with widening of the matrix in almost all glomeruli and an irregular thickened glomerular basement membrane with a “double contour” appearance (Figures and ). In the immunofluorescence studies, the staining of immunoglobulins G, A, M, and C3 was granular and located along the glomerular capillary loop (). Electron-dense deposits were confirmed in the subendothelial space by electron microscopy (). These findings were consistent with the findings of MPGN. On the other hand, severe hyaline changes of the arterioles were observed, especially from the efferent and afferent arterioles to glomerular arterioles (). Granular deposits were also found in many places in the thickened subendothelial basement membrane or the basement membrane-like material of the arterioles, similar to the findings of GOM by electron microscopy (). These findings were consistent with CADASIL, whereas the loss of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was not observed in the patient at that time. </Context> <Question> Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 62 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 3.63 mg/dL.  The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0. The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1. The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as: GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL. Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 3.63^(-1.154) * 62^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=17.102. Hence, the patient's GFR is 17.102 mL/min/1.73m².",

    "problem": "<Context> A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room with left-sided weakness of 5 hours and 45 minutes duration. She had been taking warfarin due to chronic atrial fibrillation for 10 years (CHA2DS2 VASc score=2). An initial neurologic examination revealed dysarthria, left visual field defect, and face and limb weakness on the left side. Visuospatial neglect on the left side was also noted. Electrocardiography revealed an atrial fibrillation. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.74. Brain computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed tandem occlusion of the right distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and right proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) along with low densities in the right insula and the basal ganglia. Emergent mechanical thrombectomy was performed (). A 0.58 mm microcatheter was navigated across the occlusion site to the M2 portion of the right MCA using a 0.36 mm microwire. After removing the microwire, a Solitaire (ev3 Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) 4/20 stent was introduced and placed spanning the entire length of the thrombus. The Solitaire stent was retrieved during compression of the right common carotid artery, 5 minutes after deployment. After four attempts using this procedure, recanalization of the right ICA and MCA was achieved with capturing of the occluding thrombus, but the M2 superior division remained occluded. Another attempt at mechanical thrombectomy of the right M2 was conducted and complete recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score, 3) was achieved at 8 hours and 15 minutes after symptom onset. A delayed angiogram revealed complete recanalization without residual stenosis (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on the next day revealed an acute infarction in the right insula and basal ganglia with patent flows in the right ICA and MCA (). The patient had no neurologic sequelae on day 3 after stroke onset. She had been administered intravenous heparin, and switching to warfarin was attempted.\nTransthoracic echocardiography performed 5 days after the stroke onset demonstrated the presence of a thrombus, severe spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium with left-atrium enlargement (volume of 142.6 mL), and decreased left atrial appendage (LAA) emptying velocity (0.087 m/sec). On day 6 after symptom onset, a 22-mm-sized thrombus with marked left atrial enlargement was noted in the LAA on multichannel cardiac CT (). Aphasia and right-sided hemiplegia developed 2 hours and 45 minutes after cardiac CT was performed. The patient's INR was 2.34. Brain CT angiography revealed a newly developed occlusion on the M1 segment of the left MCA. Endovascular thrombectomy was attempted again (). Complete recanalization was achieved at 2 hours after symptom onset with the first attempt at suction thrombectomy and one trial mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire (ev3 Inc.) device for left M1 occlusion (). The patient's neurologic symptoms again completely resolved immediately after successful thrombectomy. Diffusion-weighted MRI conducted the next day revealed a slightly high signal intensity in the left basal ganglia (). Follow-up multichannel cardiac CT performed 3 days after the second event confirmed the disappearance of the previously observed thrombus in the left atrium, but a small residual thrombus was suspected in the LAA (). The patient was discharged to home 10 days later.\nHistologic studies were performed to investigate the nature of the thromboemboli that had been retrieved during the endovascular treatments for this patient. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the extracted thromboembolus of the index stroke revealed a large amount of fresh red blood cells (RBCs) and intact granulocytes (), while the clot of the second stroke contained few intact RBCs and granulocyte apoptosis (). However, antiglycophorin-A staining, which is used for highly selective detection of RBCs, revealed that both thrombi were mostly composed of RBCs (). </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

Previous pulmonary function test (PFT) results were not available, and the patient denied the use of supplemental oxygen therapy at home. The patient was alert, aware, and oriented to time, person, and place. He denied any recent travels or exposure to sick contacts. His vital signs on arrival to ED were as follows: blood pressure of 85/51 mmHg (mean arterial pressure of 58 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/minute, a heart rate of 114 beats/minute, a temperature of 102.8°F, and an oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 88% while breathing ambient air.

Lactic acid levels, lipid profile, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits, and urine toxicology screen was negative for recreational substances. Initial chest radiography (CXR) showed left lung opacity with consolidation (Figures , ). A critical care medicine evaluation was requested, and the patient was admitted to ICU with the diagnosis of severe sepsis with septic shock likely resulting from CAP. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation and vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) were initiated on arrival to ICU, and the patient was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation because of worsening tachypnea and increased FIO2 requirements. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and azithromycin (500 mg daily) was initiated, along with steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously every six hours) and intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) infusion.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with a normal right ventricular systolic function. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed a normal gallbladder with a normal common bile duct. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with oral contrast revealed mild peripancreatic fat stranding suggestive of non-complicated pancreatitis and duodenitis and confirmed the presence of a left lung base consolidation.\nBlood culture and respiratory culture were negative.

    "problem": "<Context> A 94-year-old female was admitted to our hospital after she fell and sustained an anterior pelvic ring fracture (Figure ). She was hospitalized for mobilization. Over the past 18 years she had been treated with anticoagulation therapy with marcumar due to atrial fibrillation, 13 years ago subsequently a cardiac pacemaker was implanted. In the first days in hospital mobilisation was painful but with a walker possible. In the early morning of the fourth day after admission she developed severe pain in the thigh. Clinically the thigh was swollen but the foot pulses were well palpable. Because of persisting severe pain and the suspicion of a deep vein thrombosis a CT-scan of the thigh and the pelvis was performed. In the further course the patient complained of a partial loss of sensation of her left leg and weakness of her shank muscles, following the innervation area of the ishiadic nerve. The CT-scan showed an extensive haematoma expanding abroad the adductor muscles in the medial compartment and in the posterior compartment (Figure &). The compartment of the M. rectus femoris was not involved. Immediate surgery was performed with a complete decompression of the compartments of the thigh as well as the draining of the haematoma and wound covering with epigard (Othomed, Vienna, Austria) (Figure &). On the second postoperative day a revision for draining of the refilled haematoma was performed. Finally five days after the initial treatment during the second revision complete skin-closure was performed strainless. In the postoperative course the patient recovered quickly and the sensomotor deficits resolved completely however she developed partial skin necrosis along the approach in particular in the popliteal fossa. Subsequently these necrosis were resected and the skin was closed again strainless. Only in the popliteal foassa a skin graft from the ipsilateral posterior thigh was needed. The skin graft healed. In the further course of the hospital stay the patient again recovered quickly and was mobilized under physiotherapy control. Fifty-seven days after the initial trauma the patient was dismissed and transferred to rehabilitation center for further mobilization. At the latest follow up one year post operatively the patient is mobile with full weight-bearing and regular soft tissue condition.\nA full-blown compartment syndrome in the thigh is a rare clinical occurrence. This is mainly due to the fact that the three muscle compartments (Figure ) in the thigh can compensate much higher volumes than the four compartments below the knee []. Not only the fascia seems to be more dilative also the thigh compartments are partly open to the pelvis explaining the higher compensation rate for increasing intracompartmental volume [,]. The small number of occurring cases makes scientific randomized prospective studies with bigger numbers difficult. However the spectrum of reported cases with different etiologies is wide: Deep venous thrombosis [], vein catheriztion [], vessel aneurysm [] the complete spectrum of femoral fractures [], total hip and knee replacement surgery, intramedullary nailing [,], gunshot and stab wounds [], sport trauma [,,-], traffic accidents [,,], external compression of the thigh [,], crush injuries [,], as well as severe blunt tissue trauma []. Mithoefer [] declares that in 46% of the cases a traffic accident is the cause for a thigh compartment syndrome. Holbein [] proclaims that regarding the literature the femur fracture is the most common cause for a thigh compartment syndrome. Kladny [] numbers this risk with 1-2%. An open fracture or wound will not safely secure the leg from a compartment syndrome [,]. Multiple trauma patients seem to have a higher risk to develope a compartment syndrome because of the concurrence of different clinical conditions. High-energy blunt trauma, external compression, systemic hypotension, vascular injury, and coagulopathy in those patients may assimilate and thus lead to a compartment syndrome []. According to Schwartz a patient with an isolated injury to the thigh without any of the above mentioned risk factors has therefore a lower risk for the development of a compartment syndrome [].\nIn cases were the patient is unconscious at the intensive care unit a compartment syndrome can stay unrecognized possibly causing devastating outcome [], as the patient can not express main symptoms like disproportional pain, paraesthesia or even paralysis. Only the palpatoric tension of the affected muscle is detectable. These cases must be taken into special account and the measurement of the compartment pressure has an important role in those cases for the diagnostic. Regarding the common literature addressing this topic the measurement of the intracompartmental pressure is the gold standard for the diagnosis []. However the reliability of these measurements is questionable, as especially in multiple traumatized patients the systolic blood pressure supported by catecholamines can pretend a stable hemodynamic situation neglecting a possibly severe disregulated microcirculation []. In addition there is no consensus in the literature about a specific intracompartmental point pressure or a rule regarding the diastolic blood pressure or the arterial middle pressure, clearly indicating the need of fasciotomy []. In our case we initially suspected a deep vein thrombosis and not a compartment syndrome. Therefore we decided for a CT scan. After the diagnosis surgery was performed immediatly and no further diagnostic was performed. Usually suspecting a compartment syndrome calculating the local perfusion pressure by measuring the the mean arterial pressure and the intramascular pressure is the gold standard.\nBecause of the wide variety of conditions in patients with huge differences in the physiological strength (young men in a car accident versus a 94-year-old women with a stable pelvic fracture) and the very limited numbers of cases with a compartment syndrome of the thigh explains why it is impossible to identify strict criteria for the need of a fascitomy. However the literature agrees that the damage caused by fasciotomy in a patient in which the tissue would not have become necrotic is far outweighed by the morbidity possibly associated by a full-blown compartment syndrome []. In a borderline compartment syndrome not only the intracompartmental pressure but close meshed checks of the sensormotor function of the affected leg as well as the typical clinical symptoms are essential for the indication of a fasciotomy.\nIn our patient the compartment syndrome developed with several days delay. This we hypothezised might be explained by the patient's clinical course. During the first days the patient was immobilized with bed rest. During remobilisation the vessels injured by the initial trauma started to bleed again, thereby creating a haematoma which followed gravity into the thigh. In our case the neurological symptoms resolved quickly after the decompression and no muscle necrosis were detected. However in this case the morbidity was caused by the high age of the patient resulting in multiple complications through a prolonged wound healing. Schwartz has already emphasized that infection is a further problem in the postoperative course in patients with a compartment syndrome. He reports local infection rate of 66% []. Although we were not able to detect any significant tissue necrosis in our patient we suppose that prolonged ischemia may have further compromised the microvascular perfusion in this old patient with already existing vascular sclerosis thus drastically increasing the risk of wound infection. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6. Because vascular disease history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 6. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 6.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 26.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 139.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 26.0 mEq/L) = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 11.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 11.0 - 12 = -1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -1.0 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -1.0 mEq/L / -2.0 mEq/L = 0.5. The patient's delta ratio is 0.5.",

At the time of presentation, the patient was asymptomatic. She was afebrile with a blood pressure of 188/90 mmHg, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 per minute and normal oxygen saturation levels. Physical examination revealed a faint 1/6 systolic murmur which accentuated to 2/6 in intensity when she was made to go from crouching to standing. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. The patient denied any pertinent family history. She was a former smoker and reported no allergies. Laboratory studies disclosed normal serum chemistry with normal troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave changes. A chest radiograph identified borderline cardiomegaly with no evidence of infection or pulmonary vascular congestion.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was pursued, which revealed normal left ventricular (LV) size and function. LVOT appeared normal without sub-valvular ridge or asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Mitral valve demonstrated normal-appearing leaflets; however, there was a large centrally echolucent sub-valvular chordal cyst greater than 1 cm in the largest diameter (Figure ). Due to concerns of possible exertional LVOT obstruction, an exercise stress echocardiography was scheduled. Labetalol was switched to carvedilol due to the latter’s negative inotropy and better heart rate control. During exercise stress echocardiography, the patient exercised to stage five Bruce protocol achieving 14.5 metabolic equivalents (METs). There was no suggestion of obstruction on doppler at rest however, transient LVOT obstruction was noted with exercise. The patient had an appropriate heart rate and blood pressure response to stress with no signs of coronary ischemia or regional wall motion abnormalities. (Figures -).\nA cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no evidence of increased enhancement confirming the diagnosis of a benign subvalvular blood cyst of the mitral apparatus. In light of asymptomatic nature of the condition, mild to moderate LVOT obstruction at peak exertion in a beta-blocker deprived state, a conservative strategy was opted after multidisciplinary discussion with cardiothoracic surgery. The patient was resumed on carvedilol and was advised to maintain adequate hydration to avoid worsening of LVOT obstruction due to dehydration. A surveillance stress echocardiogram done during six months follow-up visit showed stable exertional hemodynamics. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

She was born at term with uneventful prenatal and peripartum period. She was noticed after birth to have hypoplastic right thumb. Her parents, who are not related, have 4 other normal children. When she was initially evaluated in our center at the age of 6 and ½ years, her examination showed a head circumference of 45 cm (4.7 SD below the mean), a weight of 14.6 kg (4 SD below the mean) and a height of 100.5 cm (3 SD below the mean). She had upslanting palpebral fissures, bulbous nose, malformed right ear, retrognathia, low posterior hairline, webbed neck, and widely spaced nipples. The chest and abdominal examination was unremarkable. The cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sound, fixed split of second heart sound, and a systolic murmur grade 3/6 over the left upper sternal border. She had normal tone, power and deep tendon reflexes. The musculoskeletal examination revealed right thumb hypoplasia with absent thenar muscles, absent extensor pollicis longus, and thumb extensors. There was significant instability of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the right thumb. Skeletal survey revealed ankylosis between C3, C4 and C5 spine. The thoraacolumbar spine and the long tubular bones of both upper limbs were osteopenic. The right fifth metacarpal bone was short with hypoplasia of the first right metacarpal bone. The epiphysis of the first metacarpal bone was absent bilaterally. There was mild bilateral subluxation of the hip joints. The tibia and fibula were normal bilaterally. Hallux valgus at the interphalangeal joint was seen bilaterally. There was coning of the epiphysis of the second to fourth toes bilaterally. Echocardiogram revealed large secundum atrial septal defect measuring 12 mm with left to right shunt. Ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis indicated that the left kidney was rotated and ectopic lying down into the pelvis.\nAs part of routine diagnostic procedures a high-resolution GTW-banding study was carried on the patient’s sample. No gross abnormality was detected. Then, an aCGH experiment was performed as a further clinical screening and indicated an interstitial duplication pointed by 33 oligonucleotide probes on 5q35.2-q35.3. An interphase FISH using a probe (CTD-2301A4) within the duplicated interval re-confirmed the findings. To better characterize the duplication a high-resolution array (Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7 M) from Affymetrix Inc. (Affymetrix Inc., San Paolo, CA, US) was utilized to further delineate the gain missed during the initial standard microscope based-karyotyping. This particular chip array utilizes 2.7 million markers including 400,000 SNP probes that provide whole-genome coverage with the one of the highest density coverage among the present platforms. Based on Affymetrix’s cytogenetic assay results, the duplication extends from 175,349,728 to 177,347,753 bp (hg19) and comprises 58 genes targeted by more than 600 SNP and copy number (CN) probes covering approximately 2.0 Mb (Fig. ).

Instead, the carboxy (C)-terminal PTH assay (includes C-terminal, intact PTH and midmolecule) was measured and found to be within normal limits at 48 ng/dL (reference range < 88 ng/dL; Specialty Laboratories, Valencia, CA).\nShe was admitted for evaluation and treatment of severe hypercalcemia. After administering IV pamidronate (Aredia) along with normal saline and IV furosemide, calcium level gradually declined from 15.7 to 10.1 mg/dL over a period of 7 days. CXR was normal and screening mammogram revealed BIRAD 2 benign findings. CT scan of abdomen with and without contrast showed multiple lesions within the liver (). Colonoscopy revealed a 3 cm ulcerated mass near the splenic flexure (biopsy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma). EGD was normal. The following day after surgical consultation she was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy undergoing segmental resection of the transverse colon, where the identified cancer was located (). Open core needle biopsy of a liver mass demonstrated adenocarcinoma compatible with metastasis from colon.\nShe was admitted on two additional occasions about 1 week apart, 6 days after initial hospital discharge, for refractory hypercalcemia associated with nausea, vomiting, lethargy and confusion. Temporary and partial response was observed to IV pamidronate, in addition to saline diuresis and IV furosemide, lowering calcium from 15.6 to 12.8 mg/dL over period of 10 days.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 136.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 30.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 121.0 mg/dL.

He denied any chest pain or hemoptysis. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant 13 years prior. Given prior complications due to graft versus host disease, he was receiving prednisone at a maintenance dose of 15 mg daily for several years. He had multiple documented allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, with reported reactions including rash, hives, and anaphylaxis. Approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, he was traveling in the Midwest United States with his partner and staying in various hotels.\nUpon arrival to the hospital, he was noted to have a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 89% requiring eight liters of supplementary oxygen, and an oral temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F). He was in acute respiratory distress and had evident decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally. He was noted to have normal heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He did not have any rash on examination.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a normal peripheral leukocyte count of 10.4 x 109 cells/L (10.4 x 103 cells/µL) , decreased hemoglobin of 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL), decreased platelet count of 96 x 109 cells/L (96 x 103 cells/µL), and increased creatinine of 676 µmol/L (7.65 mg/dL). His liver enzymes were normal. His initial chest radiograph revealed diffuse, bilateral air space opacities in the mid and lower lung zones (Figure ).\nTwo sets of blood cultures were collected and sputum samples were sent for culture as well as stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). A nasopharyngeal sample was collected for respiratory virus PCR testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. In addition, a serum cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR and Legionella urine antigen were sent. He was empirically started on meropenem, vancomycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous pentamidine.\nDespite initiation of broad spectrum antimicrobials, he continued to deteriorate with increasing oxygen demands, persistent fever, hemodynamic instability, and worsening radiographic infiltrates (Figure ).\nSputum and blood cultures were negative for any bacterial growth; sputum stains and PCR were negative for P. jirovecii. His serum CMV PCR was negative. His nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus testing was negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus; however, his Legionella urine antigen was positive.\nAccording to his pharmacy records, he had previously received and tolerated a five-day course of moxifloxacin approximately one year prior to this hospital admission. Given his diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, intravenous moxifloxacin therapy was initiated. However, shortly following receipt of his first dose of moxifloxacin, he developed an allergic reaction with a generalized, erythematous, maculopapular rash and angioedema, necessitating administration of epinephrine.\nGiven his documented allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides, hemodynamic instability, and concern for poor gastrointestinal absorption of oral antimicrobials, he was subsequently treated with intravenous tigecycline with an initial, loading dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days of therapy. Intravenous doxycycline is not readily available in our institution. His oxygen requirements decreased and fever resolved following 48 hours of treatment with tigecycline. All other antimicrobials were discontinued once the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made. There was no recurrence of infection after three months of follow-up; his repeat chest radiograph showed resolution of his bilateral air space opacities.\nLater in discussion with the North Dakota Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was determined that there was an ongoing outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease associated with five cases over a 13-month period; all cases including our patient had stayed at the same hotel. Subsequent environmental testing of the hotel was negative, but this may have been impacted by a recent deep clean of the hotel’s ventilation system. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 61 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 676.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 676.0 µmol. To convert 676.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 676.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000676 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000676 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.076 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.076 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.076 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 76.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 76.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 7.6 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 676.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 7.6 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (7.6/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**61 * 1.0 = 7.51. Hence, the GFR value is 7.51 ml/min/1.73 m².",

    "problem": "<Context> The patient, a 65-year-old, white, Caucasian man with a height of 172cm, weight of 75kg and body mass index (BMI) of 25.35kg/m2, was admitted to our clinic for the first time in June 1999 when a biopsy of the left hip was done. It was diagnosed as a myxoid fibrosarcoma (low grade G2). Following the biopsy, our patient underwent a resection of a tumor and the femur 12cm in length, and a reconstruction with MP™ Reconstruction Hip Stem (Waldemar Link GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany) and HI™ Acetabulum (Intraplant, Cham, Switzerland). The femoral component was a cementless stem made of titanium alloy with distal anchoring and had longitudinal fluting to provide rotational stability. It was modular with a porous-coated surface to promote bone ingrowth. The postoperative course was without complications. Our patient underwent regular ambulatory controls with clinical and radiology examinations annually. He exerted high levels of physical activity. In October 2012, our patient felt a sharp pain in his left hip while walking in the street, which prevented him from continuing to walk. After a clinical examination and a review of his radiographs, a diagnosis of fracture of the femoral stem was made. Our patient’s left leg was immobilized and put into traction. After standard preoperative preparations, our patient had his first operation in the lateral decubitus position using spinal anesthesia. The fracture was reached with the direct lateral approach extended distally. Below the fascia, proximally around his hip, hard white-yellow tumor tissue was found that extended in the inguinum and dorsal, close to the nervus ischiadicus. It was suspected to be a recurrence of a primary tumor. The tumor tissue, 11.5cm in length and 7cm in width, was excised and sent for pathohistological analysis. Microbiological samples were taken as well. The definitive reconstruction was postponed. Our patient underwent a multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) scan of his pelvis and lower left extremity, and a bone scan with Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP). Both demonstrated a local recurrence of the primary tumor without propagation in his pelvis. Microbiological samples were sterile and C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were within the range of normal values. A biopsy suggested a definitive diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and our patient was prepared for a definitive operative procedure.\nOur patient was given spinal anesthesia, in the lateral decubitus position. We used the direct lateral approach that was extended distally. The fracture was 7cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter, just at the junction of the proximal and distal modular parts and at the level of the remaining bone after the primary resection (Figure ). The proximal part of the femoral stem was extracted easily and without complications. We continued with the disengagement of the proximal portion of the distal part of the femoral stem from the surrounding bone. We needed at least 2cm to have enough space for two locking pliers. This was achieved with a longitudinal osteotomy through the anterior cortex extending distally for 10cm (Figure A). The transversal osteotomy was 2cm below the tip of the femoral stump to allow enough space for two locking pliers. The transversal osteotomy was about 60 to 70 percent of the total bone circumference as shown (Figure B). A lamina spreader was then inserted in the osteotomy line proximally and two bone flakes were opened like a book in order to provide space for the tip of the locking pliers (Figure B). The proximal tip of the broken stem was compressed as much as possible with two locking pliers. A lamina spreader was then inserted in the remaining distal longitudinal osteotomy and carefully opened for 1 to 2mm to allow the bone to separate from the stem, avoiding fracture of the femur (Figure C). Simultaneously, a hammer was used on the locking pliers and with several strong strokes the broken stem was removed from the bone easily (Figure ). Next, a cerclage wire was inserted below the horizontal cut to prevent a possible uncontrolled fracture of the femoral bone during broaching. A second cerclage wire was inserted on the proximal 2cm of the femoral bone, which adapted perfectly. The femoral canal was reconstructed perfectly with minimal damage to the periosteum. The new revision prosthesis was then inserted in the standard manner (Figure ). </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 43-year-old Korean man. His occupation was welding, and his medical history was clear. In February 2015, he developed fever with headache and visited a local hospital, where he was admitted. There he developed right supraorbital edema and cramping pain in both legs. Laboratory findings were as follows: D-dimer 395 ng/mL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 412 IU/L, alanine amino transferase (ALT) 217 IU/L, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1,610 IU/L. Immunofluorescence assay was negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANAS), serum anti-Sm/RNP, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-SSa and anti-SSb antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Chest radiography showed haziness in both lower lobes. Computed tomography (CT) showed multifocal peribronchial consolidation and ground-glass opacity in both lower lobes, especially in the right subpleural area, and effusion. A filling defect (1.5 cm in diameter) was present in the distal right lower pulmonary vein (). Oral moxifloxacin 400 mg and intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg were administered for 4 days, which slightly improved his symptoms.\nEventually, he was referred to our hospital in March 2015, where he presented with continued fever and headache. On admission, his height was 173 cm, body weight was 54.2 kg, body temperature was 37.3 °C, and other vital signs were normal. He exhibited DM-associated skin rashes, a heliotrope rash and edema on both eyelids and eruptions on the knuckles of both hands, the prepatellar areas, both shoulders, and the back ().\nLaboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,310/µL; hemoglobin, 13.9 g/dL; platelets, 177,000/µL; CPK, 293 IU/L; AST, 90 IU/L; ALT, 70 IU/L; and aldolase, 14.0 U/L. Para nasal sinuses (PNS) film showed fluid level in the right maxillary antrum, indicative of acute sinusitis or blood accumulation in the right maxillary antrum. Neurological examination showed no motor weakness. An electromyogram showed no definitive evidence of myopathy or polyneuropathy. Skin punch biopsies of rashes on his left hand, left knee, and right back revealed superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis.\nCollectively, these symptoms led to a diagnosis of amyopathic DM with suspected right pulmonary vein thromboembolism []. Intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg once a day) and subcutaneous enoxaparin (5,000 IU twice a day) were administered. Cutaneous symptoms and laboratory findings improved gradually.\nAfter 10 days of treatment, the patient developed dyspnea, tachycardia, and left thigh pain. His hemoglobin decreased from 13.7 to 7.3 g/dL and blood pressure fell to 90/60 mm Hg. Platelets, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and bleeding time (BT) were all normal. A CT scan showed hemorrhage of the left iliopsoas, iliacus, and retroperitoneum (). LMWH treatment was discontinued, and three units of packed red cells were transfused. We applied a splint on his lower extremities and adviced complete bed rest. He then recovered successfully and was discharged on 25 days after admission. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 173.0 cm, which is 173.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 68.11 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (68.11 (in inches) - 60) = 68.653 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 68.653 kg.The patient's weight is 54.2 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 68.653 kg + 0.4 * (54.2 kg  - 68.653 kg) = 62.872 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 62.872 kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 66-year-old morbidly obese woman presented to the ED with generalized weakness over the last seven days, oliguria, poor appetite, and thirst. Her past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, morbid obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had no history of cancer or multiple myeloma, or renal disease as evident from past admissions.\nUpon presentation to the ED, she was found to have a serum creatinine of 5 mg/dL (her baseline was 0.5 mg/dL) and a serum calcium level of 23.1 mg/dL (normal reference range: 8-10.4 mg/dL) and ionized calcium of 3.23 mg/dL (normal reference range: 4.23-5.11 mg/dL). Her albumin was 3.9 g/dL, within normal range, indicating true hypercalcemia. CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed an 18 mm cyst in upper pole of the right kidney with a parapelvic cyst measuring 18 mm x 18 mm (Figure ). Chest X-ray (CXR), CT of head also did not show any significant pathology. Her other labs included a white blood cell (WBC) 14.14, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelet 427,000 platelets per microliter, sodium 131 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 89 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 36 mEq/L (normal reference 20-32 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 62 mg/dL, magnesium 3 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 71 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 46 IU/L, troponin 39 ng/mL, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 435 pg/mL, international normalized ratio (INR) less than 0, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) more than 212 s. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed intraventricular right bundle branch block (Figure ). Her vitals included a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse of 72 beats/min, and blood pressure of 160 over 83 millimeters of mercury. A hypercalcemia work-up was done which included parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related protein, and serum protein electrophoresis. PTH was found to be low at 13.9 pg/mL (normal range 15-75 pg/mL) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) was less than 2 pmol/L, normal. Serum immunofixation showed no monoclonal band, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Viral hepatitis serologies were negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 3.14 uIU/mL, normal. Vitamin D 25-hydroxy was normal, 50.3 ng/mL.\nTreatment was initiated with fluid resuscitation (1 L normal saline bolus), the bisphosphonate Zometa (Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), and Miacalcin (Mylan, Rockford, IL). A temporary dialysis catheter was placed and dialysis treatment was initiated 12 h later (day two), and again on day three due to a persistently elevated serum calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL. Dialysis was necessary as Zometa and Miacalcin were not working fast enough to ensure a positive outcome alone. In addition, there was concern for acute tubular necrosis due to Zometa in our patient with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min (Figures -, Table ). The patient’s serum creatinine and calcium levels improved by day six and patient was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "5.938",
    "Upper Limit": "6.562",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 131.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 36.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 131.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 36.0 mEq/L) = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 3.9 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 6.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.9 (in g/dL)) = 6.25 mEq/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man developed fever, profuse vomiting and diarrhoea followed by reduced level of consciousness over a 12-h duration. He had myalgia, arthralgia and frontal headache. He did not have photophobia, phonophobia, skin rash, fits, cough or urinary symptoms. He did not have any bleeding manifestations. He did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol. There was no history of illicit drug abuse or high risk sexual behavior. He had been previously diagnosed with mild intermittent bronchial asthma.\nOn examination, he was febrile (101.3 °F), drowsy with a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15. There were no skin rashes or lymphadenopathy. No focal signs were noted in the neurological examination and fundoscopic examination was normal. His Pulse rate was 112 bpm; blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg with no postural hypotension; respiratory rate was 14/min. Rest of the general and systems examinations were normal.\nHis full blood count on admission showed white blood cells of 6 × 109/L (Normal range [NR] 4.0–11.0 × 109/L) with neutrophils of 59%; haemoglobin 14.3 g/dL (NR 13.5–16.5 g/dL) and platelet count of 74 × 109/L (NR 150–450 × 109/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13 mm in first hour and C-reactive protein was 63 mg/l (NR < 5 mg/L). Serum electrolytes were normal with mild impaired renal function. Liver enzymes were elevated, alanine aminotransferase was 303 U/l (NR < 50 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase was 482 U/l (NR < 50 U/L) with a total bilirubin of 10.6 µmol/L (NR 5–21 µmol/L). His urine analysis and coagulation profile were normal. Non-contrast CT brain demonstrated cerebral oedema. Lumbar puncture was precluded by a low platelet count.\nBased on a working diagnosis of encephalitis, he was commenced on intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, aciclovir and dexamethasone, but were subsequently omitted once the diagnosis became evident.\nOn further investigation, dengue IgM antibody in serum was positive on day 6 of fever. Blood and urine cultures did not yield any microbial growth. Electroencephalography showed generalized slow wave activity. The cranial MRI showed an isolated ovoid hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum with homogeneous hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. ). A diagnosis of reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) was suspected based on the MRI appearance.\nStandard dengue monitoring of vitals, urine output, haematocrit and platelet count were done. His platelet count dropped to a nadir of 31 × 109/L, but subsequently increased. The white cell count steadily increased to 14 × 109/L and then stabilized around 7 × 109/L. Fluid leakage was not detected on repeated ultrasound scanning during the acute phase of illness.\nHe was discharged from hospital on the tenth day of illness with complete clinical, heamatological and biochemical recovery. Follow–up cranial MRI done 1 month later showed complete resolution of the splenial lesion (Fig. ). </Context> <Question> What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "3",
    "Upper Limit": "3",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 101.3 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 69.3 = 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient's heart rate is 112.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 6000.0 count/L. To convert 6000.0 count/L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0 L/m^3 which will give 6000.0 white blood cell count/L * 1000.0 L/m^3 = 6000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 14.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 3. Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 26-year-old woman was referred by her general practitioner (GP) to the gastroenterology outpatient clinic. She had been fit and well until the onset of symptoms and her only regular medication was the combined oral contraceptive pill. She had not had any previous abdominal surgery, and her obstetric history included one previous pregnancy with uncomplicated vaginal delivery 7 years previously. Furthermore, she did not have a history of asthma/eczema/hay fever/atopy. Her family history was unremarkable. She does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol.\nHer symptoms included intractable dull abdominal discomfort with intermittent spasms of more intense pain, lasting for 1–2 minutes. For the pain she had been using over-the-counter analgesia to little avail but found some relief from holding a hot-water bottle against her abdomen. This was associated with an abrupt onset of change in bowel habit, from chronic constipation to passing watery stools up to 5 times per day. She had not experienced any tenesmus, urgency, incomplete emptying, dyschezia or nocturnal symptoms. She also described feeling nauseated but had not vomited. She had frequent episodes of dyspepsia, which was largely relieved by twice-daily PPI, initiated by her GP. There was no objective evidence of any weight loss, but she had a reduced appetite and had been only able to tolerate smaller portion sizes over the past few months.\nOn examination, she did not display any peripheral stigmata of anaemia or chronic disease. She did not have any rashes, joint effusions or ocular signs. Abdominal examination revealed striking erythema ab igne, but no overlying skin blistering or desquamation. She had left iliac fossa tenderness with a degree of voluntary guarding, but no other features of peritonism. There was no clinically palpable hepatosplenomegaly or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and bowel sounds were normal on auscultation.\nFull blood count (FBC) performed before clinic in early June by her GP revealed: haemoglobin (Hb) 140, total white cell count (WCC) 19.4, eosinophils 12.94, faecal calprotectin (FCP) 83, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 2, C-reactive protein (CRP) 5.4, adjusted calcium 2.25, and albumin 48, while IgA endomysium antibodies (EMA) was negative. On the day of her clinic appointment in late June, further investigations were arranged and these revealed: Hb 149, WCC 15.8, eosinophils 8.16, renal and liver profile all within normal limits, rheumatoid factor (RhF) negative, ESR 2, CRP 4.5, complement C3 1.19, complement C4 0.18, c-ANCA/p-ANCA both negative, ANA negative, and immunoglobulin screen showing IgA slightly low at 0.71, and IgG and IgM both normal, while serum electrophoresis showed no specific electrophoretic abnormalities.\nCT of the abdomen/pelvis was carried out the day after clinic and showed thickened segments of the distal ileum including the terminal ileum, with no small bowel dilatation. Moderate volume ascites was also detected.\nStool microbiology including pathogenic ova/cysts/parasites, rotavirus antigen, Clostridium difficile toxigenic antigen, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Campylobacter culture, Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli 0157 was all negative.\nGastroscopy performed in early July was macroscopically normal to the second part of the duodenum (D2). Unfortunately, only one duodenal biopsy was taken due to poor tolerability of the procedure, but the histology was essentially normal, without excess infiltration of eosinophils.\nWe did not perform a bone marrow biopsy or screen for PDGFRA, BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutations.\nThe first step in the management of this patient was to exclude parasitic/enteric infection and obtain relevant information to rule out hyper-eosinophilic syndrome or haematological causes of raised peripheral eosinophilia. Usually, eosinophilic gastroenteritis is diagnosed by confirmatory histopathology.\nAfter excluding infection, we decided to cautiously initiate a reducing regime of prednisolone 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to be reduced by 5 mg weekly thereafter. This was started before endoscopic evaluation was undertaken due to the severity of the patient’s symptoms and the low clinical suspicion of other pathology.\nThe patient was reviewed on a fortnightly basis. Unfortunately, the patient was unable to have sedation for her gastroscopy and the procedure was abandoned due to poor tolerance. The colonoscopy was cancelled for similar reasons. Abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) 3 months after the initial CT revealed complete resolution of the ascites and a normal appearance of the distal ileum. Over a 2-month period, the peripheral eosinophil count fell from 12.94 to 0.01. The patient was appropriately followed up. </Context> <Question> Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

    "Lower Limit": "1.53",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL). The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL. The concentration of Albmumin is 48.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 48.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 4.8 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 48.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 4.8 g Albmumin/dL.  The concentration of Calcium is 2.25 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 4.8 g/dL)) + 2.25 mg/dL = 1.61 mg/dL. The patient's corrected calcium concentration 1.61 mg/dL.",

An abdominal examination revealed tenderness, but no muscular tension was evident; bowel sounds were audible. No edema of her extremities was observed. She presented with hyperkalemia (potassium level, 8.1mmol/L), a serum creatinine (s-Cr) level of 9.9mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 107.2mg/dL, indicating renal failure.

However, four days after the removal of the transurethral catheter, her symptoms re-occurred; her s-Cr and BUN levels became elevated, and her urinary output gradually declined. At that time, we noted the presence of mesothelial cells in her urine (Figure ), leading to the suspicion of an intraperitoneal rupture of her bladder. Cystoscopy showed a diverticulum in the apex of her bladder and a possible fistula. After the transurethral catheter was re-inserted into her bladder, her symptoms alleviated, and her s-Cr and BUN levels returned to normal.\nOur patient underwent surgery to close the fistula and subsequently received 10 hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions.

Laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell count, 7860/mm3; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; platelet count, 445,000/mm3; serum sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 4.3 mEq/L; chloride, 104 mEq/L; glucose, 108 mg/dL; amylase, 85 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 35 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 14 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 150 U/L; hepatitis B surface antigen, nonreactive; and anti-hepatitis C virus, nonreactive. Her INR was reported to be normal at 1.1. Thyroid function tests were normal. Chest radiography also showed no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated slightly increased echogenicity in the renal parenchyma. Electrocardiography and echocardiography findings were normal. The patient rapidly became oliguric (<500 mL/day) and thereafter was anuric (0 mL/day). Blood creatinine increased to 2.6 mg/dL (blood urine nitrogen [BUN], 8 mg/dL) during the first 24 hours and to 3.1 mg/dL (BUN, 11 mg/dL) the next day. The baseline creatinine value was normal. Nevertheless, levels of LDH, ALT, and AST were elevated at 1,129 U/L, 62 U/L, and 139 U/L, respectively. Her scleraes were anicteric. The abdomen was soft, flat, and without palpable organomegaly. There was no edema. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, PaO2 of 80 mmHg, BE of −11 mmol/L, and HCO3 of 14 mmol/L. Blood chemistry and urine sediment showed signs of proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi’s syndrome) with hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, metabolic acidosis, and renal glycosuria despite normal plasma glucose concentration.\nAfter consultation with personnel at Turkey’s National Poison Information Center, we started oral treatment with the chelating agent sodium-2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS), which is related structurally to 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (dimercaprol, also known as British anti-Lewisite), using the following regimen: DMPS, 600 mg orally every 8 hours for 14 days. Hemodialysis was performed because of anuria and severe metabolic acidosis. Hemodialysis was conducted daily for the first 4 days and then three times weekly. Arterial blood gases returned to normal. Afterwards, the patient’s urine output progressively increased. Levels of LDH, ALT, and AST also returned to normal. The patient recovered clinically and was discharged after 15 days in hospital. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 5.2 mg/dL and 20.0 mg/dL, respectively. Eight weeks after discharge, the patient’s renal function (serum creatinine and BUN) test results remained high. The patient is still on hemodialysis approximately 1 year later. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "10.45",
    "Upper Limit": "11.55",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 14.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 14.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 14.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 14.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 14.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 14.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 14.0 mEq/L) = 23.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 23.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 23.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 23.0 - 12 = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 11.0 mEq/L.",

It was not associated with fever, cough, dyspnoea, wheeze or haemoptysis. There was no history of swelling in the lower extremities, weight loss or anorexia. There was no history of any significant comorbidities. He was a smoker (8 pack-years). He had no history of drug abuse.\nOn examination, his temperature was 37.2°C, pulse was 77 beats⋅min−1, respiratory rate was 22 breaths⋅min−1, blood pressure was 112/66 mmHg and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 98% on room air. There was no pallor, clubbing, pedal oedema, icterus or lymphadenopathy. The breath sounds were absent in the infrascapular and infra-axillary areas on the right side. No adventitious sounds were heard on either side of the chest. The remaining systemic examination was unremarkable.\nInvestigations revealed a haemoglobin level of 16.4 g⋅dL−1, and total leukocyte count of 8870 cells⋅mm−3 with a differential count of 62% neutrophils, 28% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 2% eosinophils and 1% basophils. The platelet count was 160 000 cells⋅mm−3. Creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests were normal. The ECG was unremarkable and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Chest radiograph () showed a mild, right-sided pleural effusion, blunting of the left costophrenic angle, no shift of mediastinal position and no lung parenchymal opacities.\nHe was subjected to a diagnostic thoracentesis, which showed 6.5 g·L−1 protein (corresponding serum proteins were 7.3 g·L−1), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration was 820 U⋅L−1 (corresponding serum LDH was 563 U⋅L−1) and that of glucose was 7 mmol⋅L−1. The erythrocyte count was 2 700 000 cells⋅µL−1, and leukocytes count was 3400 cells⋅µL−1 with 53% neutrophils, 42% lymphocytes and 5% monocytes. The Gram stain and cultures were sterile. There were no acid-fast bacilli seen in smears and real-time PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The cytological examination showed no malignant cells.\nHe was treated with antibiotics and analgesics. 48 h after admission, the patient complained of severe, left-sided chest pain in the night. It was nonradiating and not associated with sweating, nausea or vomiting. There was no haemodynamic compromise and the patient was normoxaemic. There were reduced breath sounds in both infrascapular and infra-axillary areas. An ECG was performed ().\nSerial cardiac enzymes were normal. Chest radiography was also repeated ().\nThe patient had a bout of cough associated with mild haemoptysis and fever of up to 38°C. The possibility of PE was entertained. The revised Geneva score for the assessment of the clinical probability of PE was 5, suggesting that there was an intermediate probability of an embolism. Therefore, a D-dimer test was ordered and the level was found to be 3.6 mg⋅L−1 (normal range 0.09–0.33 mg⋅L−1). In line with the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected, not high-risk PE proposed by the European Society of Cardiology [], the patient was subjected to computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which showed filling defects in the both lower and upper lobar arteries, right middle lobe, and lingular arterial branches consistent with an acute PE. There was no right ventricle enlargement seen in the four-chamber view of the heart by CTPA, which was suggestive that there was no right ventricular dysfunction ().\nThe patient was found to be in PESI class I. This, combined with there being no signs of right ventricular dysfunction on CTPA and normal troponin levels, was suggestive of a low risk of adverse early outcome. He was given enoxaparin 7 days, followed by dabigatran. Blood and sputum cultures were eventually found to be sterile. The autoimmune/vasculitis screen was negative. Gradually, over the next few days, the patient’s fever subsided and his chest pain resolved completely. He was continued on dabigatran and a repeat chest radiograph at the last follow-up showed a complete resolution of the pleural effusion on left side with a residual blunting of right costophrenic angle (). A pleural fluid acid-fast bacillus culture showed no growth of any organism after 6 weeks of incubation. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0. Pulmonary Embolism is reported to be the #1 diagnosis or equally likely to be the #1 diagonsis and so we add 3 points to the score making the current total = 0 + 3 = 3. The patient's heart rate is 77.0 beats per minute. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and so the score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 3. Because the patient has not had an immobilization for at least 3 days, and the patient did not have a surgery in the past 4 weeks, the score remains at 3. Because the patient has no previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the score remains at 3. Hemoptysis is reported to be present and so one point is incremented to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4. Malignany with treatment within 6 months or palliative is reported to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 4.

    "problem": "<Context> A 70-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department complaining of right-sided weakness. The patient described the weakness as progressive in nature that had begun two weeks prior. One week after the onset of her initial weakness, she had begun to suffer from minor falls due to the right hemiparesis. Her family was present at the bedside and noted that they had observed a mild left-sided facial droop and slurred speech several days before. She denied any head trauma or confusion; however, she admitted to mild right-hand tremors that had started one month prior. Her past medical history was significant for RA, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. She was on chronic therapy for RA with methotrexate (7.5 mg PO once every week) and infliximab (3 mg/kg IV every eight weeks) for the past two years. Her family and social history were noncontributory, apart from her owning a cat.\nOn physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact, and pupils were 3 mm and reactive. Both upper and lower extremity motor strength was 5/5 on the left and 4/5 on the right. There were no tremors or facial droop noted at the time of the exam.\nThe patient’s complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 8,000/uL, platelet count of 266,000/uL, and hemoglobin level of 12.7 g/dL. Her blood chemistry lab work revealed sodium of 143 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, carbon dioxide of 27 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL. Her glucose level was 91 mg/dL. The patient underwent a head CT without contrast, which demonstrated bilateral edema and lesions throughout the basal ganglia (left greater than right) with mild mass effect on the left ventricle as shown in Figure .\nMRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed bilateral ring-enhancing lesions in the basal ganglia (left larger than right) with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle from the larger lesion as shown in Figures , . CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without contrast was performed and was negative for primary malignancy.\nDue to the characteristics of the lesions on MRI, there was high suspicion for brain metastases, which prompted a brain biopsy of the left intracranial intraparenchymal mass for diagnosis. The tissue specimen showed necrotic brain tissue with patchy marked inflammatory changes as well as structures morphologically compatible with tachyzoites of toxoplasmosis. Special stains for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, acid-fast bacilli, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 were all negative. Immunohistochemistry for toxoplasma was positive and a diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was made. Serology revealed that the anti-toxoplasma immunoglobulin G was >400 IU/mL (positive). The patient had a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen and antibody screen as well as a normal T cell count (T cell total 1,499 and CD4 786). The patient was started on dexamethasone due to cerebral edema and her immunosuppressive medications were discontinued. As pyrimethamine was unavailable, treatment began with high-dose TMP-SMX (400 mg q12h). Due to an unfortunate post-biopsy hemorrhage, the patient’s neurologic status after treatment initiation was unable to be accurately monitored.

He also endorsed dyspnea on exertion and a weight gain of 8 pounds in the past 2 weeks. Of note the patient did not have a prior history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and previous echocardiograms revealed normal heart function.\nApproximately 3 weeks prior to presentation, the patient underwent preoperative testing at a different facility in preparation for primary hip arthroplasty. Nuclear stress test at the time showed multivessel coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and abnormal myocardial perfusion. Echocardiogram revealed the presence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy with an abnormal strain pattern and an inferobasilar aneurysm. The patient was then scheduled at that facility for a coronary angiogram but was deferred due to elevated creatinine. His anti-hypertensives losartan and chlorthalidone were discontinued at discharge due to the elevated creatinine. The patient was directed to follow up with his cardiologist whom he scheduled an appointment in 4 weeks’ time.\nIn the time between the preoperative testing and presentation to our hospital, the patient reported initially feeling well. He endorsed a healthy lifestyle with the ability to exercise and walk miles without any difficulty. He was employed as a physical education teacher. As the lower extremity swelling worsened, he started to develop shortness of breath limiting his activity level which prompted his visit to the emergency room.\nOn arrival to our hospital, the patient’s vital signs were all within normal limits and his blood pressure was well controlled despite the recent discontinuation of some of his anti-hypertensives (). Physical examination exhibited leg edema, crackles on auscultation and flat neck veins. Laboratory results showed an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (1,761 ng/L), troponin (0.31 ng/mL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (55 mg/dL) and creatinine (3.46 mg/dL) (). According to medical records, his baseline creatinine ranged 1.4 - 1.8 mg/dL. Urine analysis revealed hematuria and proteinuria suggesting nephrotic syndrome (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) displayed low-voltage normal sinus rhythm. Repeat echocardiogram at our hospital confirmed the severe left ventricular hypertrophy with reduced ejection fraction of 46-50% but also revealed a strain pattern suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis.\nThe patient underwent laboratory investigation for amyloidosis due to the echocardiogram findings. Total urine protein was elevated (1.19 g/L) and positive for monoclonal free lambda light chains (Bence-Jones protein). Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) showed markedly decreased total protein, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia and increased alpha-2-globulin. It also revealed a monoclonal protein peak migrating in the beta-globulin region making up 0.21 g/dL of the total 0.67 g/dL, a second monoclonal protein peak migrating in the gamma globulin region making up 0.10 g/dL of the total 0.22 g/dL with markedly increased free lambda light chains and markedly decreased kappa/lambda ratio.\nDiagnostic testing for amyloidosis was initiated with a fat pad biopsy that upon Congo red staining was indeterminate for amyloid deposition. Bone marrow biopsy of the left iliac crest showed extensive interstitial infiltrate of atypical plasma cells (80-90%) in the form of diffuse sheets that is consistent with multiple myeloma. An X-ray skeletal survey was negative for any osteolytic lesions. The patient was scheduled for positron emission tomography (PET) on a later date at an outpatient center.\nThe patient was initially started on a daily dose of 40 mg intravenous dexamethasone. Once the multiple myeloma diagnosis was confirmed with bone marrow biopsy, the patient received two rounds of “CyBorD” chemotherapy treatment: cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. CHF medications and diuretics were administered to manage volume overload secondary to cardiac amyloidosis. As treatment progressed, serial labs indicated increased uric acid production (12.3 mg/dL) that was treated with one-time rasburicase and managed thereafter with allopurinol. He also received “Granix” (tbo-filgrastim) to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia while undergoing chemotherapy. After 9 days of initial hospitalization, the patient was scheduled for a third chemotherapy session and discharged to home.\nSeven days later, the patient presented again to our facility with continued symptoms of worsening dyspnea and generalized edema. Additionally, he tested positive for a urinary tract infection and was started on antibiotics. Blood work revealed acute on chronic kidney disease with significantly worse creatinine of 5.40 mg/dL compared to previous admission. He was promptly started on hemodialysis. Next morning, the patient became hypoxic and hypotensive requiring transfer to the intensive care unit where vasopressors, inotropes and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) were initiated. Shortly thereafter, the patient went into cardiac arrest and resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

The patient was born with complex congenital cardiac anomalies, consisting of a single ventricle (right ventricle type), a complete endocardial cushion defect, corrected transposition of the great arteries, right isomerism, and a supracardiac type total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The patient underwent correction of the total anomalous pulmonary venous return and bidirectional cavo-pulmonary shunt when he was 11 months old, and a Fontan procedure at age 3 years. The patient was taking aspirin (200 mg), digoxin (0.25 mg), enalapril (5 mg) and, atenolol (12.5 mg) daily. The initial vital signs were a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 126 mmHg and heart rate (HR) of 116 beats/min. Arterial blood sampling was obtained on room air, and showed hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mmHg). The patient also had compensatory polycythemia (hemoglobin 15.8 g/dl) secondary to chronic hypoxemia. The last cardiac catheterization was performed when the patient was 12 years old, and it showed only mild atrio-ventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR). The mean pressure of the Fontan pathway was 13 mmHg. Laboratory testing revealed increased serum (3,533 pg/ml; normal < 1,050 pg/ml) and urine (768.2 µg/day; normal < 97 µg/day) norepinephrine and urine vanillylmandelic acid (8.8 mg/day; normal 2-7 mg/day) levels. Computed tomography showed a 4 cm mass in the left para-aortic area above the left kidney. With an impression of pheochromocytoma, the patient was scheduled for laparoscopic excision of the tumor. Phenoxybenzamine (10 mg) was administered daily for 2 weeks before the surgery. Preoperative electrocardiography showed supraventricular tachycardia and 24 h Holter monitoring showed no significant cardiac arrhythmia except intermittent junctional rhythm. Echocardiography revealed mild AVVR. The estimated ejection fraction of the ventricle was approximately 50% and the ventricular wall motion was normal. There was no obvious stenosis within the Fontan pathway or the scanned parts of pulmonary vessels.\nAfter being administered intravenous midazolam (1.5 mg), the patient was brought to the operating room. The initial SBP and HR there were 144 mmHg and 94 beats/min, respectively. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam (2.5 mg), etomidate (10 mg), remifentanil (40 µg), and rocuronium (50 mg). The trachea was intubated and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% oxygen in 2 L/min fresh gas. In addition, intravenous remifentanil was infused continuously during the surgery. The right radial artery was cannulated for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and continuous central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring was started. The initial CVP was 15 mmHg. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted smoothly and the echocardiographic evaluation revealed normal ventricular function with mild AVVR. After achieving hemodynamic stability, a continuous infusion of milrinone (0.5 µg/kg/min) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) (1 g/h) was started after a 1-g loading dose of MgSO4 to prevent severe pulmonary hypertension and maintain a stable blood pressure during the surgery.\nSurgery was started, and intra-abdominal CO2 insufflation was begun for the laparoscopic procedure. After insufflation, the CVP was increased to 28 mmHg and the SBP rose from 90 to 128 mmHg (). Simultaneously, the peak inspiratory pressure increased from 17 to 24 cmH2O. The arterial oxygen saturation decreased from 100 to 97%, and the arterial oxygen partial pressure dropped from 196 to 93 mmHg. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was maintained between 13 and 15 mmHg. The inspired oxygen fraction was transiently set to 1.0, and an immediate TEE evaluation showed preserved ventricular contractility without aggravation of the mild AVVR. To prevent abrupt arterial hypertension, a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was started (0.5 µg/kg/min) and titrated up to 1.5 µg/kg/min. However, four further sudden increases in SBP over 160 mmHg, up to 194 mmHg, occurred during the dissection and approach to the tumor; these were controlled by intravenous bolus injections of SNP (30 or 40 µg) and remifentanil (40 or 50 µg). No significant cardiac arrhythmias were detected, except sinus tachycardia during the dissection.\nApproximately 2 h after establishing pneumoperitoneum, the surgeon decided to convert from laparoscopic surgery to a laparotomy, suspecting aortic invasion of the tumor. After exsufflation, the CVP decreased from 18 to 10 mmHg and the SBP dropped from 120 to 70 mmHg. Subsequent TEE showed decreased ventricular volume with preserved contractility. After fluid resuscitation and continuous infusion of dopamine (5 µg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.02 µg/kg/min) for approximately 7 min, the SBP recovered and was maintained at 100-120 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that the oxygen partial pressure had increased to 157 mmHg. Subsequently, there were several abrupt increases in SBP up to 190 mmHg until the tumor was excised; these were well controlled with bolus injections of SNP and remifentanil.\nThe tumor was removed approximately 260 min after beginning the surgery. After removing the tumor, the MgSO4 was discontinued and the milrinone was tapered (0.25 µg/kg/min). Continuous infusion of dopamine (5 µg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.04 µg/kg/min) was initiated. The infusion rates were tapered to 3 and 0.02 µg/kg/min, respectively, before the end of surgery. The duration of the surgery and anesthesia was 490 min. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and extubated 12 h later. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl was used to manage postoperative pain, which was relatively well controlled. All inotropics were discontinued on the third postoperative day. Subsequently, the patient was moved to a general ward and discharged uneventfully on the 13th postoperative day. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area?

Physical examination at admission revealed mild edema of the lower limbs with no associated corneal arcus or xanthoma. Laboratory investigations showed anemia (98 g/L), elevated serum urea (6.7 mmol/L) and creatinine (58 μmol/L), and decreased albumin (21 g/L). Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (4+) and microscopic hematuria (3+). Urinary protein was 2.06 g/24 h. Lipid profile showed elevated total cholesterol (5.04 mmol/L), elevated triglyceride (2.18 mmol/L), and normal LDL-cholesterol (2.24 mmol/L).\nBased on laboratory findings, secondary causes of NS were excluded. Anti-nuclear, anti-cardiolipin, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies were negative. Rheumatoid factor was also negative. Hepatitis B and C serology were negative. In addition, complement C3 and C4 levels were normal. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal-sized kidneys. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of primary NS.\nDespite treatment with prednisone (60 mg/day) and captopril (60 mg/day) for 2 months, her massive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria persisted, thereby prompting further evaluation via percutaneous renal biopsy. Light microscopy showed segmental glomerulosclerosis in three out of nine samples and mild-to-moderate proliferation of the mesangial cells and matrix (). The capillary lumina were dilated due to the presence of lipoprotein thrombi with pale staining on periodic acid-methenamine silver (). Oil red O staining confirmed the presence of intraluminal lipid droplets (). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that immunoglobulins (i.e., IgG, IgA, and IgM) and complement factor 1q (C1q) were negative. These findings were highly suggestive of LPG.\nGenetic testing confirmed the presence of the c.127C>T (p.R43C) or Kyoto mutation of the APOE gene (). Her parents refused to undergo genetic screening.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 29-year-old female athlete (height = 170 cm; weight = 60 kg). Exercise intensity before the injury included 16 h/week of volleyball training and another 6 h/week of kite surfing (Tegner score 9). Injury occurred during an indoor volleyball game, in which the patient landed poorly. The injury was an acute indirect injury to the knee (Video 1). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Helsinki Committee (Trial registration number NCT00767780). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\nImmediately after injury, the patient experienced pain, swelling and difficulty bearing weight. She arrived at the emergency room after the injury, where the physician on staff noted pain, swelling and effusion of the knee. A radiograph ruled out a fracture. A joint aspiration suggested an acute ACL tear. The patient was discharged with instructions for physical therapy and a follow-up after a week. At follow-up, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, which showed a complete ACL rupture, lateral bone bruising and minor medial and lateral meniscal tears to her left knee. A total of 2 days after injury, the subject arrived at the AposTherapy center and underwent a gait analysis. Following the gait analysis, the all phases of step-cycle (Apos) system was calibrated. Treatment was then initiated, which included carrying out her daily routine with the biomechanical device. In all, 10 days post-injury, the patient started traditional physiotherapy in addition to AposTherapy for 6 months. The subject underwent follow-up gait analyses at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 26.\nAposTherapy uses a biomechanical device () comprising four modular elements attached to foot-worn platforms (Apos system, Apos Medical and Sports Technologies Ltd., Herzliya, Israel). The modules are two convex-shaped biomechanical elements attached to each foot. One is located under the hindfoot region, and the other is located under the forefoot region. The elements are attached to the subject’s foot via a platform in the form of a shoe. The platform is equipped with a specially designed sole that consists of two mounting rails that enable flexible positioning of each element under each region. Each element can be individually calibrated to induce specific biomechanical challenges in multiple planes.\nGait analysis was carried out using a computerized mat (GaitMat™ system; E.Q. Inc. Chalfont, PA, USA). During each gait analysis, the subject was required to walk barefoot at a self-selected speed for 3 m before and after the end of a walkway mat to allow sufficient acceleration and deceleration space outside the measurement area. Each gait test included four walks, and the average value of the four walks was calculated for each parameter. The following spatiotemporal parameters were evaluated in each gait test: velocity (cm/s), step length (SL) (cm), single limb support (SLS) (%gait cycle), base of support (BOS) (cm) and temporal distance (T-D) symmetry. T-D symmetry was calculated for SLS and SL (see ).\nAt the end of the study, the patient was asked to fill out the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) to evaluate the severity of pain and the levels of function and quality of life.\nA physical examination of the patient at 3 weeks post-injury showed that the knee was swollen with minimal to moderate effusion. A range of motion exam showed full extension and painful flexion to 100°. Anteroposterior (AP) stability was examined via the Lachman maneuver, anterior drawer test and pivot shift test. All tests were positive and confirmed the findings of the MRI exam of an ACL rupture. Over the rest of the study, the swelling and effusion reduced significantly. At 3 months post-injury, the subject first returned to beach volleyball, and by 6 months, she returned to her previous level of activity (Video 1).\nGait measurements at baseline and at each follow-up are presented in . All gait parameters and T-D symmetry steadily improved from baseline to week 4, after which, they remained stable for the rest of the treatment period. Compared to baseline, velocity steadily increased by 244% of its original value (); SL gradually increased by 66% and 90% in the involved and uninvolved limb, respectively (); SLS increased by 43% for the involved limb and decreased by 24% for the uninvolved limb () and BOS decreased by 46% and 32% in the involved and uninvolved limb, respectively (). T-D symmetry for SL improved from a value of 12.2% at baseline to −1.4% at the end of the study period.

The pain in the abdomen was diffuse and more as discomfort, which started following a jerk while the patient was traveling in a bus. No prior history of diabetes, hypertension or renal disease was reported.\nInvestigations conducted in a local hospital had revealed numerous red blood corpuscles (RBCs) and white blood corpuscles (WBCs) in urine sediment and 4 + proteinuria. Ultrasound showed moderate ascites. Plain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly with ascites. Serum creatinine measured the following day was high (4.0 mg/dl); hence, an opinion from a nephrologist was sought.\nUpon examination, he was anxious and hemodynamically stable. The lungs were clear and abdominal distension and ascites was present. Pedal edema was absent. Following are the reports of the investigation carried out: hemoglobin, 17.6 g/dl; total leucocyte count, 20100 cells/m3; differential count polymorphs, 79%; lymphocytes, 17%; eosinophils and monocytes, 2% each; urine showed 3 + protein; 6-8 WBCs and numerous RBCs; arterial blood gas analysis pH, 7.31; bicarbonate, 10.8 meq/l; pCo2, 22.2 mmHg; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 60 mg/dl; creatinine, 5.9 mg/dl; sodium, 131 meq/l; potassium, 5.1 meq/l; calcium, 8.6 mg/dl; phosphorus, 6.7 mg/dl; uric acid, 10.2 mg/dl; total bilirubin, 0.3 mg/dl; protein, 8.0 g/dl; albumin, 4.2 g/dl; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 38 u/l; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 25 u/l; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 96 u/l.\nWe suspected intraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder because of the abrupt onset of symptoms. We performed catheterization of the urinary bladder, draining 3.5 l of hemorrhagic fluid. Abdominal distension began to regress and the patient started feeling relieved after this drainage. Cystogram showed leakage of the contrast into the peritoneal cavity []. Ascitic fluid creatinine and urea nitrogen approximated the values that are usually observed in urine samples rather than in blood (86 mg/dl and 425 mg/dl, respectively).\nFollowing this confirmation, the patient underwent emergency laparotomy.

His medical history included type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He had had type 2 diabetes for 10 years and was being treated at the time with vildagliptin, metformin, and dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was added 8 months prior to admission. He reported a weight loss of 3 Kg following the commencing of dapagliflozin, but his weight appeared stable during the last 3 months. The A1C was 7.1% one month before admission. The patient noted that he suffered from recurrent episodes of abdominal pain the last 2 months.\nAt presentation the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats/min, temperature 36.8°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. The patient appeared mildly dehydrated with a BMI of 26.5 kg/m2. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness in the epigastrium and left upper quadrant. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nAn arterial blood gas analysis was performed and revealed metabolic acidosis pH 7.33, HCO3− 10.9 mEq/L, and PCO2 21 mmHg with an increased anion gap at 29 mmol/L. Plasma glucose was mildly elevated at 203 mg/dL. Serum lactate was 1.1 mmol/L, i.e., within normal range. The rest of laboratory investigation was as follows: white blood cells 7860/μL, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, serum urea 84 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.33 mg/dL, Na+ 134 mmol/L, K+ 4.6 mmol/L, and Cl− 94 mmol/L. C-reactive protein level was moderately elevated at 8 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed glycosuria and ketonuria (glucose 4+, Oxone 4+). Measurement of serum ketones was not available.\nThe patient was diagnosed with euDKA possibly related to dapagliflozin use and was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin, with subsequent improvement of acid base disorders within the first 48 hours. He was also treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast was ordered to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal pain. The CT scan revealed ascending and transverse colonic dilatation proximal to a transition point in the splenic flexure and decompressed bowel distal to the obstruction, highly suspicious of colonic malignancy. Colonoscopy was then performed which showed splenic flexure cancer. The patient was transferred to the surgical clinic and underwent left hemicolectomy.

    "Lower Limit": "1.24",
    "Upper Limit": "1.37",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 94.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 94.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 94.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 94.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 94.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 94.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 10.9 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (94.0 mEq/L + 10.9 mEq/L) = 29.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 29.1 mEq/L. Plugging in 29.1 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 29.1 - 12 = 17.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 17.1 mEq/L. Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 17.1 mEq/L / 13.1 mEq/L = 1.305. The patient's delta ratio is 1.305.",

On clinical exam, the patient had red-brown macules and papules symmetrically distributed on the dorsum of hands, elbows, periocularly, and periauricularly (Figs. , ). Yellow translucent firm papules were noted on the helix of the left ear, glabella, and bilateral eyebrows. There was no lymphadenopathy. Joint examination revealed swelling and tenderness in proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (PIPs, DIPs), metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs), elbows, shoulders, and knees.\nAn aspirate from his knee effusion revealed a total nucleated count of 5540/mm3 with 16 % neutrophils, 54 % lymphocytes, and 30 % monocytes. Synovial fluid analysis did not reveal crystals and cultures were negative. Serum laboratory studies were unremarkable, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood cell counts, liver and renal function tests. His antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor were negative.\nInitial clinical differential diagnosis included dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. A skin biopsy demonstrated numerous multinucleated histiocytes infiltrating between the collagen bundles in the superficial dermis (Fig. ). There is a Grenz zone separating the epidermis from the dermal tumor. The multinucleated histiocytes are large with an eosinophilic and finely granular “ground-glass” cytoplasm. The nuclei are haphazardly arranged, but tend to favor the center of the cells (Fig. ). Additionally, there are an increased number of blood vessels amongst the histiocytes, as well as scattered lymphocytes. A CD163 stain was diffusely positive and the cells were focally PAS-positive diastase-resistant. The cells were negative for S100. Polarization did not reveal and polarizable material. These findings are diagnostic of MRH.\nRadiographs of the hands showed erosions in the left third DIP and right second DIP, in addition to mild joint space narrowing with mild diffuse osteopenia. There were also erosions seen in the scaphoid bone with surrounding soft tissue swelling (Fig. ). Given the age of the patient concomitant osteoarthritis is the most likely cause of joint space narrowing. The patient’s left shoulder X-ray showed marked glenohumeral joint space narrowing, small humeral head osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts (Fig. ), and large erosions of the humeral head. The bones were diffusely demineralized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder showed moderate glenohumeral joint effusion with synovitis and well-demarcated erosions of the humeral head (Fig. ). We performed an ultrasound on the second right MCP (Fig. ) and first Interphalangeal joint which showed minimal effusion but marked synovial proliferation with moderate Doppler flow, suggesting disease activity. An ultrasound of the knee showed a large anechoic effusion, echogenic synovial proliferation with grade 2 Doppler flow (Fig. ).\nGiven the association of MRH with internal malignancy (Trotta et al. ), the patient underwent cancer screening. This screening included colonoscopy and chest/abdominal computed tomography (CT). Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was negative. He was initially started on prednisone and methotrexate 20 mg/week with subsequent improvement in the appearance of his cutaneous disease. Due to continued pain and joint swelling after 3 months of treatment, he was started on adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week which was eventually increased to weekly dosing. Alendronate (70 mg weekly) was also started because of evidence in the literature of benefit in patients with MRH.\nOver a follow-up period of 4 years the patient’s disease symptoms were largely controlled on the above medication regimen. However, imaging continued to show effusions in the hand joints and marked synovial proliferation in multiple MCPs, PIPs, and DIPs. Also, despite most of his symptoms improving, he had continued prominent right shoulder pain, with progressive disease shown on MRI, requiring joint replacement. He continued the use of the above medication regimen, and was able to taper his prednisone to 3 mg daily.

Blood chemistries showed urea nitrogen of 56 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.98 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 3.09 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 42 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 25 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 147 U/L, albumin of 3.1 g/dL, corrected calcium of 13.4 mg/dL, phosphorus of 3.1 mg/dL, intact parathyroid hormone of <1.2 (normal: 15–65) pmol/L, and 1,25-OH2 vitamin D of 152 (normal: 19.9–79.3) pg/mL. Anti-HIV serology testing showed negative results. Cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion was seen on chest radiography. Transthoracic echocardiography indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%, moderate aortic regurgitation, severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, and multiple oscillating masses on the anterior mitral valve leaflet ranging from 1.5 cm to 2.4 cm in diameter (, yellow arrows). Skin scraping of the facial lesion exhibited both extracellular and intracellular yeast-like organisms with buddings, 2–4 μm in size, on Wright's stain, most likely Histoplasma. As a result, disseminated histoplasmosis and endocarditis were diagnosed, and 3 mg/kg/day intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was administered immediately. The patient had a profound cardiogenic shock and atrial fibrillation one day after being admitted to the hospital, and echocardiography indicated a mechanical obstruction of the mitral valve orifice caused by the vegetation. Three large vegetations on the anterior mitral valve leaflet were identified during emergency open-heart surgery (), and a mechanical prosthetic mitral valve was placed. Histopathology examination of the vegetation showed many yeast-like organisms. However, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he died four days after the operation from intractable multiorgan failure.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration. The patient is 34 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0. The concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.98 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2. Plugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.98/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**34 * 1.0 = 44.622. Hence, the GFR value is 44.622 ml/min/1.73 m².",

The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 12.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 110.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 141.0 + (12.0 / 2.8) + (12.0 / 18) = 292.397 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 292.397 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient is a 38-year-old male that was transferred to our emergency department (ED) from an outside hospital status post cardiac arrest. The patient was an inmate at a local prison who was found unresponsive in his prison cell. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) was called for medical support. Minimal health information was provided by the prison. The patient was found by EMS to be in ventricular tachycardia with a palpable pulse and was intubated on the scene. The patient was given 150 mg of amiodarone, and transportation to an outside facility was initiated. On laboratory evaluation at the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have a potassium level of 9. Treatment of the patient's hyperkalemia with insulin, beta-agonists, and calcium was initiated. After initial resuscitation, the patient was transported to our ED. While en route, the patient experienced an episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia, requiring two episodes of cardioversion. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved prior to ED arrival.\nUpon arrival to our ED, vitals were as follows: blood pressure 91/48, heart rate 145 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, oxygen (O2) saturation 99%, temperature 35.3 Celsius (C). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which documented ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 140 without ST segment or T wave changes. On exam, the patient was noted to be intubated. Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) exam revealed 3 millimeter (mm) pupils that were sluggishly reactive to light and equal bilaterally and an endotracheal tube at 25 centimeters (cm) at the teeth. The remainder of the HEENT exam was unremarkable. Neck exam revealed a cervical collar in place with no cervical spine step-off noted. Cardiovascular exam revealed a heart rate of 140 beats per minute with palpable distal pulses. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds and no evidence of distension. On neurological exam, the patient was noted to be sedated with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 3T.\nThe patient had blood sent to the lab for multiple studies. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) revealed a white blood cell count of 23.6 thou/cu mm, a hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit of 45.5%, and a platelet count of 181 thou/cu mm. His basic metabolic panel revealed a sodium of 143 mmol/L, a potassium of 8.7 mmol/L, a chloride of 120 mmol/L, a bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L, a BUN of 22 mg/dL, a creatinine of 1.06 mg/dL, and a glucose of 191 mg/dL. Venous blood gas revealed a pH of 7.06, pCO2 of 58 mmHg, and pO2 of 77 mmHg. International normalized ratio (INR) was 1.4. Cardiac markers and urinalysis were both unremarkable. A urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines.\nThe patient's emergency department management began with initial stabilization. Due to his persistent ventricular tachycardia, the patient was given another bolus of amiodarone upon arrival and a subsequent amiodarone infusion was started. Due to low mean arterial pressures, two liter of normal saline was given intravenously, a right subclavian central venous line was placed, and a left radial arterial line was placed. A levophed drip was started at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 for pressure support. Treatment for hyperkalemia was readministered concurrently, consisting of insulin, beta-agonists and kayexalate. Chest X-ray revealed clear lungs with radio paque capsules in the fundus of the stomach. Over the next thirty minutes, the patient's rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm and slowed to around 70 beats per minute. Repeat potassium lab draw revealed persistently elevated potassium level of 8.3 mmol/L, and hyperkalemia treatment was repeated. At this point, nephrology was consulted for emergent dialysis, and the medical intensive care unit (MICU) was notified for admission. We later found out, from the MICU team, that the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed to remove the unknown pills from the patient's stomach, which were found to be potassium chloride pills. After removal of the pills and multiple episodes of dialysis, the patient stabilized and was weaned from pressure and ventilator support. The patient's leukocytosis was believed to be a stress response as the MICU team was never able to determine a source of infection; however, the patient remained on-broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics over the course of his stay. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L? </Question>",

Because the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 44.0 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 32) * 44.0 * 0.85) / (0.79 * 72) = 71.013 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 71.013 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 61-year-old man presented to the ED after having black stools for 24 hours. This episode was preceded by the spontaneous onset of abdominal cramps, followed by dyspnea, fatigue, and light-headedness. His prior medical history included multiple hospital admissions for upper GI bleeding. There was no history of smoking, alcohol intake, or illicit drug use. On initial examination, he appeared lethargic, with a blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg, a pulse of 83 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% while breathing room air. He had conjunctival pallor. Cardiovascular examination revealed a systolic ejection murmur with late systolic peaking and soft second heart sounds. Laboratory tests showed a blood glucose concentration of 101 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of 4.6 x 109/L, a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 207 x 109/L. Other laboratory tests showed sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 22 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 21 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. He was deficient in high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Abdominal CT and upper GI endoscopy yielded negative results. A previous capsule examination of the small bowel had been negative. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severely sclerotic aortic valve with area of 0.65 cm2 and left ventricular ejection fraction 65% (Figure ).\nThe patient was treated with intravenous administration of the proton pump inhibitor octreotide as well as two units of packed red blood cells. Because of his history of chronic GI bleeding, anemia, and AS, he was diagnosed with Heyde syndrome, a diagnosis supported by the deficiency in high molecular weight multimers of vWF.\nThe patient underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement, with the insertion of a 27-mm tissue valve.

    "Upper Limit": "-0.95",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 11.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 11.0 - 12 = -1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -1.0 mEq/L.",

Review of systems was remarkable for a week of mild painless hematochezia. He was using aspirin frequently for control of his fevers. His family and social history were unremarkable beyond owning a pet dog. He reported a dental cleaning approximately 5 months prior to presentation. At the time of presentation, he had undergone extensive infectious and rheumatologic evaluations for persistent but undifferentiated fevers. Blood cultures obtained three months prior to admission, and again one week prior to admission at a separate facility in Bactec Plus aerobic and anaerobic FAN bottles, processed in a Bactec 9120 system (Becton Dickinson), were negative after 5 days of incubation.\nOn physical examination the patient was febrile to 38.8°C. He was diaphoretic but otherwise well appearing. He had no evidence of dental or periodontal disease and no visible oropharyngeal abnormalities. Cardiovascular examination was notable for an old III/VI holosystolic murmur greatest at the left lower sternal border, radiating to the back, and an old II/VI diastolic murmur best appreciated over the RUSB. The pulmonary exam was unremarkable. Abdominal exam was notable for slight tenderness to palpation in the RLQ. On rectal exam, no perianal lesions were noted and there were no masses in the rectal vault; he had brown, guaiac positive stools but no melena. No other findings of endocarditis were appreciated.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed a hematocrit that was decreased to 30.7% from a preillness baseline of 48%, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 44 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 55 mg/L, and creatinine of 1.01 mg/dL. His white blood cell count was 6,000 per mcL. A urinalysis with sediment was notable for 1+ blood, and 2 red blood cells per high-powered field on microscopy. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed mild, diffuse thickening of the mitral valve with trace mitral regurgitation and focal thickening of the pulmonic valve homograft, which were highly suggestive of a valvular vegetation. There was stable, severe dilation of the aortic root. These findings were confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\nBlood cultures were sent on the day of admission and processed with the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux) and on day 2 grew thin, tapered Gram-variable rods from an anaerobic FAN bottle. Subcultures grew only on Brucella agar plates incubated within an anaerobic chamber, and Gram stain of the culture revealed thin Gram-negative rods with tapered ends. This isolate was negative for oxidase and spot indole testing. The patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole for empiric coverage. Multiple blood cultures continued to be positive for Gram-negative rods from anaerobic FAN bottles, and Gram-variable rods were also subsequently isolated from both aerobic and anaerobic FAN bottles over the following 2 days during which the patient was taking antibiotics. Despite the positive blood cultures, the patient defervesced and felt better following the administration of antibiotics. Blood cultures drawn on day 3 of antibiotic treatment were negative and remained negative after 5 days. At discharge, the isolate was still not identified.\nAdditional work-up with gas-liquid chromatography revealed a large peak for lactic acid and a small peak for acetic acid. The appearance on Gram stain, aerotolerance noted on further passage, and lactic acid production were most consistent with Leptotrichia species. A RapID ANAII test, which uses conventional and chromogenic substrates for species identification, did not reveal any satisfactory matches. Isolates were sent for 16S rRNA sequencing as a definitive diagnosis was unattainable via conventional phenotypic methods. Following 16S rRNA sequencing, a search of the Isentio RipSeq 16S database yielded a match with a 99.9% identity for L. goodfellowii and 7.3% difference separating it from another related species.\nThe patient was discharged on piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole as these antibiotics had demonstrated clinical effectiveness in a previous case report []. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates via Etest showed sensitivity to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.016 μg/mL), clindamycin (MIC 0.016 μg/mL), metronidazole (MIC 0.25 μg/mL), and penicillin (MIC 0.125 μg/mL). Following the availability of susceptibility data, the patient was switched to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and in total completed a 6-week course of antibiotics. He was then started on chronic suppressive therapy with penicillin V potassium, which was complicated by elevated liver transaminases and discontinued. He was then started on cefpodoxime, which he has tolerated well. Cardiac surgery was under consideration but ultimately deferred as he has been otherwise asymptomatic and with stable cardiac imaging since his hospitalization. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. Because hypertension history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 0. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1.

The patient was admitted to the hospital seven weeks prior to this admission for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His course was complicated by a right hepatic artery injury treated with ligation and clipping, with subsequent development of multiple hepatic abscesses, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, and a bile leak. The bile leak required treatment with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and a common bile duct (CBD) stent placement. The patient was discharged to rehab with a Jackson Pratt (JP) drain (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) in place. He was continued on daptomycin and ertapenem for four weeks for hepatic abscesses per the infectious disease specialist. The patient returned to the hospital for recurrent fevers and melena. History was limited due to acute delirium but right upper quadrant abdominal pain was noted. He denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His JP drain had a recorded output of approximately 30-40 cc/day.\nThe patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit within a few hours of admission. Other vital signs were significant for sinus tachycardia, with 110 beats per minute, and tachypnea, with 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were at 154/65 and 100% on room air, respectively. The physical exam was notable for confusion, abdominal tenderness to palpation that was worse in the right upper quadrant, and the JP drain in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings on admission were significant for leukocytosis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of up to 13,200/mm3. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted to be at 6.2 gm/dL and 19%, respectively, which was decreased from the hemoglobin of 10.3 gm/dL on the day of his last discharge. Platelets on admission were within normal limits at 213,000/mm3. His comprehensive metabolic panel from admission revealed transaminitis, with an elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 149 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 134 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase at 51 0U/L. There was no significant elevation of total bilirubin. The patient's prothrombin time was elevated to 16.1 seconds, and the international normalized ratio INR was 1.41 on admission.\nOn day one, the patient became hemodynamically unstable, with worsening mentation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit. Surgery and gastrointestinal medicine were consulted for evaluation. The patient underwent imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed persistent postsurgical changes of cholecystectomy and an unchanged common bile duct stent. A right-sided abdominal drain was noted to be in the right upper quadrant. Multilobulated, predominantly hypoattenuating masses were noted throughout the liver, with persistent hyperdensity, more centrally suggestive of combined multifocal hepatic abscess and central hemorrhage, also reported. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and resuscitated with intravenous (IV) lactated ringer fluids. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nHe was taken for an esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess for causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). This did not show any evidence of active bleeding or hemobilia at the previous sphincterotomy site; however, the patient had significant melena noted at the end of the exam and was emergently taken for further evaluation with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). CTA revealed transient hyperdensity within the right lobe of the liver, adjacent to the right portal vein, suspicious for a hepatic artery injury/pseudoaneurysm as seen in Figure .\nFigure shows CTA findings of the clipped right hepatic artery from the patient's initial surgery.\nHe was then taken for visceral angiography by interventional radiography (IR), which confirmed a previous iatrogenic hepatic artery ligation and showed an arterial enhancing structure within the central aspect of the liver consistent with a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, as seen in Figure and Figure .\nThe patient’s pseudoaneurysm was not amenable to catheter-directed embolization, as there was no direct feeding arterial structure identified. He was subsequently taken to the operating room for a right hepatectomy. Post right hepatectomy, the patient remained tenuous and began to decline quickly after developing acute oliguric renal failure, which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and resistant hypoglycemia. Additionally, worsening shock required pressure and, ultimately, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L. The patient's concentration of AST is 149.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of ALT is 134.0 U/L. The patient's concentration of platelets is 213000.0 count/µL. To convert 213000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 213000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 213000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 213000000000.0/(10^9) = 213.0 billion platelet counts per liter. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (73 * 149.0)/(213.0 * sqrt(134.0)) = 4.411.

He had begun feeling depressed without a known cause 8 months ago. At almost the same time, he had started to engage in involuntary movement such as kicks and grasps during nighttime sleep, with snoring and sleep apnea. He took diazepam tablets, but it did not work. Afterwards, he noticed excessive sweating and felt hot and cold waves. His maximum body temperature was 37.2°C; after he used nimesulide, the temperature dropped to 35.0°C and was subsequently increased, with difficulty. Moreover, he got terrible constipation at that point. He visited mental health centers and was diagnosed with “mild depression” without auxiliary examinations or treatment 4 months ago. About 3 months ago, his family noticed that he had lost approximately 20 kg in weight, choked when drinking, and exhibited slow response, visual hallucinations, and walking unsteady. He got frequent drops from bed during sleeping due to his substantial actions; meanwhile, gasping breath and sleep apnea fragmented his sleep. Eventually, he spoke seldom and seemed to be blunt with shuffling gait.\nThe patient did not have any relevant medical history. He denied having history of trauma, prior blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, and alcohol abuse (Table ).\nThe patient was the fourth individual in his large family to exhibit the same clinical manifestations. The other 3 members all died within a year after onset (Fig. , pedigree chart).\nEight months after the onset, he was taken to our hospital by his families. We did series of tests at that time.\nThe middle-aged man appeared dull. During check-up, he fell into “sleep” easily and soon was awakened in horror by his involuntary sleep movements or snoring. The skin and general examination were normal. Temperature: 36.5°C, respiratory rate 20/min, Blood pressure (lying): 165/109, Pulse: 115. Blood pressure (standing): 150/100 mm Hg, Pulse: 110. Weight: 77 kg. Height: 178 cm.\nHe exhibited severe cognitive impairments, particularly with respect to orientation, attention, calculation power, delayed memory, and visuospatial dysfunction (his Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 15/30 and 9/30, respectively).\nHe had slurred speech and dysarthria\nCranial nerves (CNs) I-VIII and XI-XII revealed no deficits. CN IX and X showed slowness of bilateral gag reflex, and limited symmetrical elevation of soft palate to phonation.\nMuscle tone was normal. Muscle strength was 5/5 for all groups tested. Spontaneous and evoked myoclonus was evident.\nBilateral biceps reflex and bilateral triceps reflex were 3/4, and bilateral patellar reflex and bilateral Achilles reflex were 4/4. Hoffman sign and Babinski sign were absent. Frontal lobe signs palmomental and grasp were not elicited.\nTouch, pin, vibratory, and proprioception sensations were normal. Romberg test was negative.\nCoordination was inaccurate for finger/nose testing and heel/knee/shin testing; rapid alternating movements were clumsy.\nArm swing was absent. There was bradykinesia and postural instability. Rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia (dysarthria and gait instability), and myoclonus were typical signs in prion diseases.\nTemperature monitoring revealed that the patient's body temperature fluctuated from 36.0°C to 37.8°C, and the loss of circadian rhythm was observed. Blood pressure monitoring indicated a steady high blood pressure of approximately 150/100 mm Hg and the loss of dipper-type blood pressure rhythm, with a heart rate that fluctuated approximately 100 beats per minute. A dynamic electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with the incidental discovery of multifocal ventricular premature beat.\nBlood examinations such as blood routine, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, myocardial enzyme, blood ammonia, homocysteine, folic acid, VitB12, microelement (calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, lead, thallium, zinc), thyroid function and antibodies, rheumatism biomarker, infection-related antibodies (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV), and tumor marker showed normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (intracranial pressure was 200 mmH2O, cell number 1, glucose, chloride, protein, acetic acid, IgA, IgM, IgG, Oligoclonal bands, PCR for JC virus, EB virus, HSV-I virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) appeared normal and 14–3–3 protein was negative. Autoimmune encephalopathy related antibodies (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, contactin-associated protein 2, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 1 receptor, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 2 receptor, leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1, gamma-aminobutyric acid B), and paraneoplastic syndrome related antibodies (CV2/CRMP5, PNMA2, RI, Yo, Hu, Amphiphysin) in blood and CSF were all detected, but none of them indicates abnormity. Routine urinalysis and fecal analysis were normal. Hormone secretion detection demonstrated the abnormal secrete rhythmicity of prolactin and growth hormone.\nExtensive θ activity and scattered slow waves are recorded in an electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the frontal and temporal. Polysomnogram (PSG) demonstrated the patient's obvious deprivation of total sleep time; neither spindle nor slow wave sleep was detected during his “fragmented sleep,” even when he showed snoring, mentalis relaxation, sleep apnea, and hyoxemia (Fig. ).\nThe nucleotides from 12742 to 13318 (GenBank accessionnumber U2918) of exon I in PRNP were amplified; then, polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. The results were analyzed using DNA Sequencing Analysis Software version 3.4.1 (Gene Codes Corp, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Genetic analysis found that the patient harbored a D178N/129M haplotype mutation in PRNP (a GAC→AAC homozygous mutation at codon 178 and a methionine polymorphism at codon 129).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with FFI and received treatment with drugs to improve brain metabolism, such as idebenone, ganglioside, and coenzyme Q10. During the follow-up by telephone, his wife told us that he got once improvement in his responsiveness soon after discharge; however, sudden death occurred 3 months later. The total disease course was 11 months.\nThe patient information involved in our manuscript has been obtained and informed consent was obtained from his legal representatives. All human studies have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> A previously healthy 74-year-old woman, 143 cm in height and 49 kg in weight, visited our hospital to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for a check-up. She experienced abdominal discomfort to soybean without skin lesion and asthma, but she had no other remarkable medical history including allergy. An EGD procedure using 15 mg propofol was performed twice in this patient prior to this admission without any side effects. Her initial blood pressure (BP) was 130/70 mmHg and heart rate was regular, ranging from 80 to 90 beats per minute. We did not use lidocaine for oropharyngeal anesthesia, and all of the medical team involved in her exam used vinyl gloves. Under standard monitoring, sedation was induced with 15 mg intravenous propofol (Propofol Inj., Jeil Pharm, Seoul, Korea). The patient was then sedated and we began the exam. Approximately 1 minute following administration of intravenous propofol, stridor was heard and oxygen saturation fell to 56% on pulse oximetry. We immediately applied inhaled oxygen (6 L/min) via nasal prong, but oxygen saturation did not increase. We decided to stop the exam, and tried to remove the endoscope. However, the endoscope became stuck in her throat. Thus, we removed the endoscope by compulsion. Ten seconds after endoscope removal, severe wheezing was heard and her oxygen saturation fell to 56%. The larynx was observed using a laryngoscope for endotracheal intubation. At that time, marked swelling and severe edema of the epiglottis extending to the arytenoids cartilage was detected. Epinephrine (1 mg) was immediately administered subcutaneously, together with 125 mg intravenous methylprednisolone infusion. Because the patient's symptoms did not improve after 1 minute, 1 mg epinephrine was administered intravenously. After a further 1 minute, her oxygen saturation recovered to 98% and the wheezing subsided. The patient's BP never went below 130/70 mmHg during the event. She recovered smoothly from anesthesia without signs of airway obstruction and was transferred to the general ward. Blood samples were drawn immediately after the event. Tryptase level (normal range, 0-13.5 µg/L) was 4.65 µg/L at 5 minutes and 6.61 µg/L at 2 hours. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.404, pCO2 42.5 mmHg, pO2 119.6 mmHg, HCO3- 26 mEq/L, and SaO2 98.3%. Total IgE was 111 kU/L. The patient underwent skin-prick testing 14 days after the event. The skin-prick tests of 55 common inhalant allergens were negative. However, propofol and 20% intralipid (SMOFlipid®, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) showed an immediate reaction (). Thus, we suspected the soybean in intralipid, a component of propofol, as the cause of the anaphylaxis, because she had a food allergy history to soybean. She was informed of the results and of the risk for anaphylaxis if re-exposed to propofol or nutritional supplements containing soybean in the future. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Although mitral regurgitation had been diagnosed in childhood, she noticed exertional dyspnea at 64 years of age. She had no other medical history and took no medications preoperatively. We explained the CEINB procedure and imaging evaluation in detail and obtained written informed consent.\nOn arrival in the operating room, she had stable hemodynamic parameters. We initiated preoperative monitoring including standard monitoring, electroencephalography using the bispectral index monitor and cerebral/somatic oximetry using INVOS™ (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland), and CCO/SvO2 monitoring using Vigilance® (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). General anesthesia was induced with 200 μg fentanyl and 4 mg midazolam after pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen. We administered 50 mg rocuronium after induction, and a 35-Fr left double-lumen endotracheal tube was carefully inserted without complications. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, sevoflurane (1–1.5%), remifentanil (0.1–0.35 μg/kg/min), and intermittent administration of rocuronium and fentanyl. Invasive monitoring included a radial arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter; a 7.5-Fr vascular access sheath was inserted through the right internal jugular vein. In the supine position with 30° elevation of the right side, she underwent a MICS mitral procedure through a right thoracotomy approach via a 5.5-cm incision at the fourth intercostal space. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol (4–6 mg/kg) during cardiopulmonary bypass. Following administration of intravenous unfractionated heparin (18,000 units), femoral-femoral CPB was established, and mitral valve plasty was performed. In total, 500 μg of fentanyl was administered during the operation: 300 μg before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass and 200 μg after withdrawal of CPB. The surgeon placed the catheter for CEINB in the following steps before closing the chest (Fig. ).\nFirst, a syringe filled with isotonic saline was connected to a long 8-Fr vascular access sheath (8Fr × 25 cm, Radifocus® introducer IIH, Terumo Corporation, Japan), which was inserted from the outer edge of the incision to between the innermost intercostal muscle and parietal pleura. To avoid damaging the parietal pleura and blood vessels, the blunt catheter with a soft tip was used instead of a needle. The placement was confirmed by injecting saline and observing the elevation of the parietal pleura. When the tip of the sheath reached the posterior thorax, 20 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine was administered. The tip of a catheter (19-Ga × 90 cm, Arrow®FlexTip Plus® Epidural Catheter, Teleflex Medical Japan, Japan) was then placed into the posterior thorax via the sheath. The surgery proceeded uneventfully, and the vital signs remained stable.\nAfter surgery, we assessed the general condition by plain chest radiography and simultaneously determined the appropriate positioning of the catheter tip; 20 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 240®, GE Healthcare, Japan) was then injected through the catheter to confirm the spread of the local anesthetic and the catheter position. The contrast medium was distributed between the parietal pleura and innermost intercostal muscle across the 3rd to the 5th intercostal areas (Fig. ); 0.17% levobupivacaine was then continuously administered at 4 mL/h using a disposable continuous infuser (Bezelfuser, TORAY Medical, Japan). In addition, a patient-controlled analgesia apparatus was provided at 3 mL for postoperative pain, with a lock-out time of 30 min. The patient was moved to an intensive care unit and extubated 4 h after transfer.\nPain intensity was assessed by ICU nurses using a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10. During extubation, the patient rated 0/10 for postoperative resting pain and 4/10 for movement pain without other analgesics. She was discharged to the general ward on the day after surgery; patient-controlled analgesia was activated only once on the second postoperative day. Both resting pain and movement pain were subsequently rated as 0/10; administration of local anesthetics was continued. She did not receive any other analgesics, and the analgesic catheter was removed 72 h after surgery. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12 without any complications. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m². </Question>",

He had previously been admitted to an outside hospital after developing sudden-onset tonic-clonic seizures and expressive aphasia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain at that time revealed scattered subcentimeter ischemic infarcts in the right and left frontal lobes, right parietal lobe, and the left cerebellar hemisphere. He was transferred to our institution for further management.\nUpon admission, the patient was admitted to the neurosciences intensive care unit for further monitoring. He was placed on continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed new mild hypodensities in the right subcortical frontal lobe with stable hypodensities in the periventricular white matter, left subcortical frontal and left occipital lobes (). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a moderately dilated left atrium with a 40 × 39 mm spherical echogenic, heterogeneous mass originating from a left pulmonary vein (, ). Given that the patient had no significant cardiovascular history, it was concluded that the embolic infarcts were likely secondary to tumor shower from the left atrial metastasis from his primary SCLC. The patient was scheduled to undergo cardiac MRI imaging to further characterize the left atrial lesion and extent of invasion, but given the risk of intubation and sedation, this was deferred. A CT-angiogram and chest X-ray of the chest was conducted which demonstrated encasement of the left main pulmonary artery with direct extension of the left pulmonary vein and left atrium (, ).\nIn the setting of metastatic left atrial invasion with metastatic thromboembolic spread to the brain, the patient was started on anticoagulation with a heparin drip in the hospital and later transitioned to enoxaparin.

The investigation concluded with a sural nerve biopsy that revealed neurolymphomatosis (DLBCL) with secondary nerve microvasculitis.\nThe decision was made to treat with 8 grams/m2 and administer 15 grams of MTX based on a CG estimated creatinine clearance of >120 mL/min calculated using a serum creatinine of <0.4 mg/dL (comparable to available creatinine values in 1 month prior to admission) and body surface area (BSA) of 1.88 m2. Unfortunately, dysautonomia associated with the neurologic syndrome precipitated a hypotensive event requiring vasopressor support and a delay of chemotherapy. This acute decompensation prompted increased scrutiny of the patient's renal function beyond standard serum creatinine measurements. A cystatin C measurement returned at 1.81 mg/L, which indicated a CKD EPICr-CysC eGFR of 69 mL/min/1.73 m2 (70 mL/min).

The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium but no rebound or guarding. The neurological exam revealed normal cranial nerve function, full strength and sensation, and a normal gait. Deep tendon reflexes were not documented.\nA metabolic panel including electrolytes, glucose, BUN and creatinine were normal. Liver function tests showed albumin at 3.6 g/dL(normal 3.2–5.5), AST at 118 IU/L(normal 8–40), ALT at 197 IU/L(normal 0–60), alkaline phosphatase at 51 IU/L(normal 26–110), and total bilirubin at 1.5 mg/dL(normal 0–1.4). The lipase level and complete blood count with differential were normal. A voided urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.024, pH at 7.30, ketones at 150 mg/dL, small bilirubin, urobilinogen at 8 mg/dL, 2 red blood cells/high power field (hpf), 3 white blood cells/hpf, 6 epithelial cells/hpf, moderate bacteria, and no hemoglobin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, protein, glucose, or crystals. A urine pregnancy test was negative. Bedside ED ultrasound by the EP showed no evidence of cholecystitis.\nThe patient received two liters IV normal saline and two doses of antiemetics. She then tolerated an oral liquid challenge, felt better and requested to be sent home. The discharge diagnosis was possible gastritis versus viral hepatitis. Lansoprazole 15 mg once daily was prescribed, with primary care physician (PCP) follow up in 1–2 days. A repeat set of vital signs was not documented.\nSeven days later, the patient returned. She had seen her PCP who referred her for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She had not eaten or drunk for 20 hours prior to the procedure. The EGD, done with fentanyl and midazolam sedation, found a small hiatal hernia with no other abnormalities. Because of persistent tachycardia in the 140s/minute with intractable vomiting, the patient was sent directly to the ED. The patient stated the vomiting had resolved since the last ED visit and only started again after the EGD. The epigastric pain persisted without change and the only additional complaint was tremulousness. She continued to deny fever, chills, diarrhea, and melena.\nThe physical exam showed an oral temperature of 36.3° C, heart rate at 143 beats/min, respirations at 20 breaths/min, blood pressure at 125/61 mm Hg and O2 sat at 100% on 2L/min oxygen per nasal cannula. The patient weighed 50 kg (a 2.3 kg weight loss in one week). The patient was alert, tremulous and appeared fatigued. The remainder of the exam was unchanged. She received supplemental oxygen, three liters IV normal saline, and cardiac monitoring.\nA repeat complete metabolic panel showed normal glucose and electrolytes except for bicarbonate at 19 mEq/L(normal 25–34), magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL(normal 1.8 – 2.5), albumin at 3.2 g/dL, AST at 83 IU/L, ALT at 87 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase at 48 IU/L, and total bilirubin at 0.8 mg/dL. A serum lipase level and complete blood count with differential were within normal limits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal. A urinalysis was not repeated. An EKG showed a narrow-complex sinus tachycardia at a rate of 152 beats/min with no ischemic ST or T wave changes. In addition, she had thyroid function tests sent, which are performed once daily by our institution’s laboratory. The patient tolerated oral liquids after antiemetics. Despite hydration, the patient’s tachycardia persisted at 130 beats/min. She appeared fatigued but had resolution of all other presenting symptoms. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service on a telemetry floor.\nOvernight she received two more liters IV normal saline, followed by maintenance rate. A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a markedly thickened gallbladder wall without gallstones, a small amount of pericholecystic fluid, and a normal common bile duct. Radiology recommended a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed small bilateral pleural effusions, periportal edema, upper abdominal ascites, marked gallbladder wall thickening, and moderate amount of free fluid in pelvis.\nThe next day general surgery recommended an exploratory laparoscopy. This procedure was delayed because the patient ate breakfast. The first two thyroid function panels sent from the ED and on hospital day two were invalid due to hemolysis, but a third set showed a free thyroxine (T4) level greater than 6 ng/dL(normal 0.8–1.9) and an undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (normal 0.5–5 mIU/L). After atenolol and methimazole, the patient improved and was discharged on the third hospital day with diagnoses of new onset thyrotoxicosis, dehydration, liver hemangioma, and small hiatal hernia. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

Family history of infertility was negative and his only brother fathered a child. On examination he was 180 cm, 82 kg. Each testis volume was 4 ml estimated by Prader’s orchidometer (normal range: 15-25 ml), with normal vas deferens. He had a history of right sided epididymo-orchitis. Stature growth was regular and puberty was normal without testosterone therapy. Motor and mental development of the patient was normal. There were no malformations, no gynecomastia, no diabetes and no reduced muscle strength. Olfaction was normal. The semen analysis showed total azoospermia with low volume (0.3 ml) and normal pH and fructose level. No spermatozoa were found in micro dissection TESE (MD-TESE) and the seminiferous tubules were hyalinized. Histology of testis biopsy specimen showed only Sertoli cells and moderate hyperplasia of the leydig cells. Endocrinological laboratory studies revealed elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH=43 mIU/ml, reference 0.9-8.9 mIU/ml) and luteinizing hormone (LH=14.3 mIU/ml, reference 0.8-10 mIU/ml) levels and low testosterone levels (1.4 ng/ml). The results were suggestive for hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and KS was the most probable diagnosis.\nChromosomal analysis was performed on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocyte cultures using standard cytogenetic methods. Two different cultures for the sample prepared and two different series of slides from each culture analyzed separately. Half of slides were investigated by GTG and the other half by FISH. 170 GTG banded metaphases from the patient were analyzed at the resolution of 550 bands.\nThe hybridization on metaphase chromosomes was performed according to standard cytogenetic protocols (). A triple-colour FISH with centromeric DNA probes for chromosomes X (CEP X SpectrumOrange) and telomeric DNA Probes for chromosomes Y telomer (Yq1.2-Satellite III SpectrumGreen, Direct Labeled Fluorescent DNA Probe Kit, Vysis, Abbott Molecular, USA) was used to determine the sex chromosome constitution of metaphase lymphocytes. Centromeric DNA probes for chromosomes 18 (CEP 18 SpectrumAqua) were used as control for binding efficiency (). 50 metaphase nuclei and 80 cells in interphase were scored by FISH and subsequent results are briefly given in table 1.\nAccordingly, the karyotype of the case was ascertained as: 47,XXY[251]/46,XX[10]/45, X[10]/48,XXXY[7]/46,XY[22] according to The International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature ISCN 2009 ().

Complete blood count revealed hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dl; total leukocyte count, 14,830 cells/mm3; and platelets, 2.3 lakhs cells/mm3. Serum creatinine was 16.5 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes and complements were normal. Total serum calcium was 7.1 mg/dl. Viral markers (hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus) and antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were also negative. Ultrasonogram revealed 12.9 cm kidney size bilaterally with increased echoes. Renal biopsy was performed in view of RPGN.\nRenal histology showed four glomeruli, all of which possessed circumferential active cellular crescents and fibrinoid material deposition []. Capillary tufts were nonproliferative but had disruption of capillary basement membranes and Bowman's capsule. Severe acute tubular injury was noticed. There was no giant cell reaction. Immunofluorescence panel (Dako: IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, and lambda) showed strong linear uninterrupted staining with IgG (4+ on a scale of 0–4) and kappa (4+ on a scale of 0–4) along glomerular capillary walls (GCW) in all seven glomeruli [Figure –]. Rest of the panel was negatively stained. Further subclass of IgG performed showed positive staining with IgG1 (3+ on a scale of 0–4) along GCW and negative for IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 [Figure –]. All seven glomeruli in immunofluorescence core possessed circumferential crescents. Ultrastructure of kidney retrieved from paraffin block did not show any powdery or electron-dense deposits in glomeruli and tubular basement membranes.\nA diagnosis of anti-GBM crescentic glomerulonephritis with monoclonality (IgG1-kappa light chain restriction) was made.

Her medical history included hypertension, aortic stenosis [aortic valve area of 1.09 cm, mean gradient 19.74 mmHg on two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE)] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease related to a 60-year smoking history. One month prior to presentation, she had experienced stiffness in her shoulders and was started on a corticosteroid, sulfasalazine and methotrexate for presumed rheumatoid arthritis. She had no recent history of a gastrointestinal illness.\nAt presentation, she was normotensive (121/76 mmHg). Her hemoglobin was 13.3 g/dL (133 g/L), platelets 241 × 109/L and serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (150 μmol/L). Blood cultures were negative, and chest X-ray showed non-specific bilateral interstitial markings. She was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Her sulfasalazine and methotrexate were held.\nTransthoracic 2DE revealed normal left ventricular function and unchanged aortic stenosis. Her right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 57 mmHg. Urinalysis showed trace protein and moderate blood. Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal-sized kidneys without evidence of obstruction.\nBy her 12th day of admission, her hemoglobin was 9.9 g/dL (99 g/L), platelets 63 × 109/L, serum creatinine 5.9 mg/dL (523 μmol/L) and blood urea nitrogen 120 mg/dL (43 mmol/L). Her LDH was 442 U/L, haptoglobin 1.1 mg/dL (0.11 g/L) and reticulocyte count 143 × 109/L. An autoimmune workup was positive for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) in anti-centromere pattern (1:320). Her C4 was normal at 0.18 g/L, and C3 was mildly decreased at 0.87 g/L. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor and antiextractable nuclear antigen antibodies were negative. Red blood cell fragmentation was noted on her blood film, prompting a renal biopsy that was consistent with a TMA (). She was transferred to a tertiary care hospital for PLEX.\nHer ADAMTS-13 activity (drawn prior to the first cycle of PLEX) was estimated by qualitative collagen binding assay and was normal []. She was started on an angiotensin receptor blocker that was eventually changed to an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor following discontinuation of PLEX. She required ongoing hemodialysis and platelet transfusions. Bone marrow biopsy was normal. She received nine daily 1–1.5 plasma volume exchanges with cryosupernatant plasma, without a response in platelet count [platelets were 49 × 109/L and hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL (84 g/L) on Day 9]. PLEX was discontinued due to lack of response.\nA thoracic computed tomography scan demonstrated a 4.4 cm by 3.1 cm mediastinal mass which was not seen on chest X-ray as well as enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (largest 1.5 cm) and pleural effusions (). A biopsy was not pursued because of her deteriorating status. She died on her 31st day of admission following sudden onset of confusion and hepatitis.\nAutopsy findings included an acute organized lung injury, extensive steatohepatitis and renal cortical infarctions. A high-grade malignancy was found in her mediastinum involving multiple lymph nodes. Tumor cells showed marked variability in size and shape, with nuclei having a characteristic ‘salt and pepper’ pattern by hematoxylin and eosin staining (). Immunostaining on the largest node was positive for CD56, synaptophysin, chromogranin (), low-molecular weight cytokeratin and pan-keratin but was negative for TTF-1, S100 and CD45. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intracytoplasmic membrane-bound neuroendocrine granules within tumor cells (). Overall, these findings were consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma and did not support a diagnosis of melanoma, lymphoma or bronchogenic carcinoma. No definitive primary lesion was identified.\nA post-mortem quantitative enzyme immunoassay for ADAMTS-13 activity using frozen serum demonstrated actually revealed mild deficiency prior to PLEX at 0.45 U/mL []. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

    "problem": "<Context> The case presented is that of a 45-year-old woman (height, 155 cm; weight, 56 kg; body mass index, BMI 23.0). The patient was a clerical worker who complained of working in a sitting position for a long time (6 h) a day, four times a week. The patient was informed that data from the case would be submitted for publication, and she gave her consent for publication of this report.\nThe patient was diagnosed with low back pain (LBP) and sciatica (lumbar disc herniation was not observed on magnetic resonance imaging). The patient experienced moderate dull pain from the right lower back to the hip and severe radiating pain in the right lower extremity of the lateral side for a week before her visit to the clinic (- day 7). In addition to the two types of pain, the patient also experienced numbness in the lower extremities. The chief complaint was radiating pain and insufficient sleep due to numbness; thus, the patient hoped that the pain would be relieved and she could sleep well. Another characteristic history was occasionally missing steps on the stairs and on uneven ground. Pregabalin was started at a dose of 150 mg/day. Except for the pain, there was no other medical history. However, it was noteworthy that the patient had experienced pain and numbness three years earlier. At the time, she did not visit any hospital because her symptoms did not worsen as she performed some self-stretching in the bath and could manage the symptoms herself. The symptoms were relieved after approximately a year. A summary of the patient’s pain course is shown in .\nSciatica symptoms (increased numbness and radiating pain in the lateral lower extremity) were prominent in orthopedic tests ( and ). Positive signs were observed when a straight leg raising (SLR) test was performed at 30° and on the Bragard test; radiating pain and numbness increased significantly with these tests. In addition, increased radiating pain was registered when Freiberg’s test [] and the piriformis test [] were performed; thus, these tests were deemed as positive. Extreme stiffness of the gluteus medius was observed, with muscle tenderness and increased radiating pain. However, muscle weakness was not observed in manual muscle testing.\nFor the pain assessment, the S–D dimension of pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) [] and the sub-class score in the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). The scores of the other subclasses in the MPQ were used to assess the A–E and C–E dimensions of pain. The NRS scores for dull and radiating pain were 5 points and 9 points, respectively. Further, the NRS score for numbness was 10 points in the sitting position. The total scores (average score) of the S–D, A–E, and C–E dimensions of pain were 22 (2.2), 2 (0.4), and 3, respectively.\nThe Japanese version of the PCS [], which is a translation of the original scale [], was used to assess the patient’s catastrophizing beliefs involving pain. The patient’s total PCS score was 36 points, which exceeded the cut-off point (30 points) []. The total scores (average score) of the sub-class’s rumination, helplessness, and magnification were 18 (3.6), 9 (1.8), and 8 (2.7) points, respectively.\nA line drawing of the patient’s lower extremity, drawn by herself, is shown in . The patient was instructed to draw her legs without looking at them and to not compare the affected side with the unaffected side. The maximum widths and areas of the lower extremity drawings were measured using a Foxit Reader (Ver. 9.3.0, Foxit Japan, Inc. Fremont, CA, USA). The maximum width was 3.84 cm for the right side and 1.81 cm for the left side; i.e., the right side was 2.12 times wider than the left side. Further, the areas were 39.95 cm2 for the right side and 21.06 cm2 for the left side. That is, the area of the right side was 1.89 times larger than that of the left side ().\nRadiating pain and numbness were attributed to sciatica, as many of the assessment results (tightness of the piriformis muscle, limitation of the range of motion of external rotation, and positive piriformis and Freiberg tests) indicated sciatica caused by piriformis syndrome. In addition, the reason for the dull pain from the right lower back to the hip was considered to be spasm resulting from sciatica. Therefore, sciatica management was prioritized. To address this issue, physical therapy programs were provided based on the clinical evidence of Last et al. [], which included stretching and massage of the hamstring and piriformis muscles [] and manipulation of the lumbar spine []. These interventions were provided once per week.\nIn addition to these programs, the patient received education based on the clinical practice guidelines for chronic pain [] in the pre-session on day 1. First, explanations about clinical reasoning, intervention plans, and expected changes in pain after treatment were provided. Second, we advised the patient to perform self-exercise training (piriformis muscle stretching, cat and cow stretch, and bending the trunk sideways in the crawling position) daily, as much as possible. Subsequently, the patient performed these training exercises five or six times per week. Furthermore, the patient was instructed to increase physical activity as much as possible to prevent pain catastrophizing and fear-avoidance beliefs by disuse and enhancement of the descending pain inhibitory system [].\nThe results of all assessments are shown in . A remarkable point about the pain was that there was an incongruency between each dimension of pain. By day 15, symptoms of sciatica disappeared according to the orthopedic tests (i.e., SLR test and Bragard test), and the severity of the S–D dimension in the MPQ, and the degree of dull pain, radiating pain, and numbness, as expressed by the NRS score, were also reduced. However, there was no reduction in the C–E dimension of pain in the MPQ by day 15. After day 15, the pain catastrophizing beliefs slightly improved; however, it should be noted that the PCS score still exceeded the cut-off point of 30. No improvement in the C–E dimension was observed on the patient’s line drawing of her lower extremities. The line drawing of the affected lower extremity did not improve much in comparison with the unaffected side by day 15 but had become similar to that of the unaffected side on day 36. Likewise, there was an improvement in the symptoms of missing the steps on stairs or on uneven ground on day 36; the patient could step optimally. </Context> <Question> Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

For females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (61.024 (in inches) - 60) = 47.855 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 47.855 kg.The patient's weight is 56.0 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 47.855 kg + 0.4 * (56.0 kg  - 47.855 kg) = 51.113 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 51.113 kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.\nAcidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.\nOur patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "296.4",
    "Upper Limit": "327.6",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 21.0 mmol. To convert 21.0 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 21.0 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.021 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.021 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.588 g bun. To convert 0.588 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.588 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 588.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 588.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 58.8 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 21.0 mmol bun/L converts to 58.8 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 2.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 2.5 mmol. To convert 2.5 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.5 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.54 g glucose. To convert 0.54 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.54 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 540.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 540.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 54.0 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 2.5 mmol glucose/L converts to 54.0 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 144.0 + (58.8 / 2.8) + (58.8 / 18) = 312.0 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 312.0 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 312.0 mOsm/kg.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 6-week-old male term infant, weighing 3.7 kg, presented to the accident and emergency ward with a history of fever, difficulty in feeding and rapid breathing rate for last 7 days. He was delivered by forceps at 39 weeks, was breastfed and suffered no medical problems until the presenting episode. He was treated in a peripheral hospital initially for pneumonia. However, there was no improvement even after medical therapy. He was then referred to the present hospital.\nOn examination, the baby was pale with poor capillary return and oxygen saturation of 80% on air and was in respiratory distress with intercostal retraction and tachypnoea of 60–64 per minute. On auscultation, air entry was decreased in the left lung and bronchial breathing over right haemithorax. Blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg and heart rate was 180 beats per minute. Capillary blood gas analysis demonstrated respiratory acidosis with pH 7.2, pCO2 60 mm Hg, pO2 101 mm Hg and base excess of –1.3. Chest radiography [] demonstrated partial collapse of right lung with hyperinflation of left upper lobe and marked mediastinal shift across to the right. A clinical diagnosis of CLE was made and treatment started in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with IV antibiotics, bronchodilators, and nebulisation and chest physiotherapy. Fluid resuscitation was commenced with 20 ml/kg N/5 dextrose solution that restored capillary return to normal, although tachypnoea remained. The baby was nursed on his left side overnight with supplemental oxygen delivered to a head box.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan [] done on the next day confirmed the diagnosis of CLE of left upper lobe with gross mediastinal shift. Left upper lobectomy was planned under general anaesthesia the following day.\nIn the operation theatre, monitoring was established with pulse oxymetry (SPO2), electrocardiogram (ECG) and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. Intravenous access was checked. Patient was induced with Sevoflurane 8% in oxygen, and tracheal intubation was secured after spraying the vocal cord with 10% Lidocaine spray with a 2.5-mm portex nasal tube. The tube was passed through the vocal cord down into the right main bronchus and fixed at 12 cm at nose. Right-sided endobronchial tube position was confirmed by auscultation.\nFor analgesia, a mixture of 5 ml 0.25% Bupivacaine and 0.2 mg Morphine was given via caudal epidural route. Rectal Paracetamol suppositories 125 mg were also inserted. SpO2, ECG, NIBP, capnography and temperature were monitored. Once oxygen saturation and heart rate settled during intermittent positive pressure ventilation IPPV, Atracurium 3 mg and Fentantyl 3 μg were given. Anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air and Isoflurane (0.7–1.5%) via Drager Fabius Medical Systems ventilator, and a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cm was maintained. During the initial period of left thoracotomy position, an oxygen concentration of 100% was required to maintain an oxygen saturation of 99%. As soon as the left upper lobe was isolated and clamped and branch pulmonary artery and vein were ligated and divided, oxygen saturation stabilised at 97% on 40%. Oxygen and N2O were then started. During the surgical procedure, tracheal suctioning was required repeatedly.\nAfter the removal of the emphysematous left upper lobe, the tracheal tube was withdrawn up to the carina and ventilation of both the lungs was started. IV fluid was maintained with N/5 dextrose solutions 16 ml/hour. Blood loss was insignificant. A left chest drain was left in situ. The baby was electively ventilated in the NICU for 12 hours and weaned off successfully. Postoperatively, the chest radiograph [] was repeated in the evening and revealed complete correction of the mediastinal shift and marked expansion of the right lung.

Her initial vital signs were as follows: pulse rate 111/min, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and body temperature, 38.9 °C. On physical examination, no abnormal findings were detected except for left costovertebral angle tenderness. On initial laboratory tests, she had thrombocytopenia (platelet counts, 62 K/mm3). There were no findings of leukocytosis or prothrombin time prolongation. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 38.6 mg/dL and 0.6 mg/dL, respectively. The results of liver function tests were within normal limits. The level of C-reactive protein was elevated to 19.24 mg/dL. E. coli grew in urine and blood cultures. She was finally diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis and treated with intravenous administrations of ceftriaxone 2 g once daily for 4 days, and then ciprofloxacin 400 mg twice daily for 10 days. She recovered after systemic antibiotics treatment.\nAt presentation, diffuse and slate gray-bluish pigmented patches were noticed on her face and nails. Neurologic examination showed that the patient’s motor powers of the upper and lower extremities were grade IV and III, respectively. Five years before presentation, the patient had ingested soluble silver-NPs for a year for the purpose of health promotion. She used a colloidal silver generator, which produces 5 ppm of colloidal silver water in a single cycle by electrolysis using silver electrodes. She gave a detailed account to have ingested 0.8-1.2 l of colloidal silver solution daily for approximately 12 months.\nHer facial discoloration was first noticed 2 years before presentation. She first experienced muscle weakness of both upper and lower extremities 1 year before presentation. As her muscle weakness gradually worsened, she visited a different hospital seeking a diagnosis 2 months prior to visiting our hospital. She was diagnosed to have inflammatory myopathy after pathological tests of samples obtained from her left thigh muscle at the other hospital, and received steroid therapy. Despite taking oral prednisolone 1 mg per kg body weight per day, she did not show any clinical improvement.\nUpon admission to our hospital, serology testing for connective tissue disease-associated autoantibodies including dermatomyositis was performed and there were no abnormal findings for anti-Jo1, anti-Ro/La, or the fluorescent antinuclear antibody, anti-ds DNA, anti-CCP Ab, anti-U1RNP, anti-Sm, or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. We performed chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) to exclude cancer-associated myopathy and did not find any other tumorous lesions. We also performed endoscopic gastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy, but observed no discoloration on the gastrointestinal mucosa and no silver particles in biopsy specimens.\nOcular argyrosis was not found in the cornea or conjunctiva. The histopathologic results of skin biopsies from pigmented areas of forehead and nose revealed brown-black granules in the basement membrane of sweat gland epithelium that measured less than 1.0 um in diameter, which are diagnostic findings of argyria (Fig. ). We reviewed outside pathology slides obtained from the left thigh muscles and found markedly degenerated myofibers with disorganization of myofibrils without inflammatory reactions, consistent with unspecified myopathy, rather than inflammatory myopathy (Fig. ). We performed electromyography and nerve conduction studies for muscle weakness, which revealed diffuse, mild motor dominant polyneuropathy of both upper and lower extremities. A heavy metal analysis of hair samples including arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and bismuth showed all levels within acceptable ranges and copper levels below normal. We diagnosed the patient with generalized argyria with myopathy and polyneuropathy. She was transferred to a rehabilitation institution after slowly tapering off of steroids on the 22nd day of hospital admission. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

The wound started to smell bad. The patient had a history of diabetes, which he reports to be diet controlled. He is a truck driver by trade and says he does his best to do a good job with his diet. His past medical history was notable for testicular cancer status after radiation 9 years earlier. He states that his left groin skin has always been a little sensitive after the radiation and in that he often will itch it. He says this wound started out as an itch as well. Intense itching led to an open wound, at which point he applied povidone iodine and put a dressing on it. He was remarkably stoic, considering the extent of the wound.\nReview of systems is negative except as noted above. The patient specifically denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or headache. His prescribed medications included atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, Diltiazem and Lisinopril for hypertension, Metformin for diabetes, and Gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy. The patient had no allergies and his tetanus status was up to date.\nPatient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 145/85 mmHg; respiratory rate 20/min; pulse 91/min, SpO2 99%, temperature 36.7°C; and pain 8/10. On physical exam, he was alert and oriented to person, time, and place and in no acute distress. Pertinent positive findings included a 4 cm × 10 cm elliptical wound on the left thigh with necrotic flesh within, which was exquisitely foul smelling (). The left leg appeared somewhat mottled and cellulitic compared to right leg. Both legs had intact dorsalis pedis and popliteal pulses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.1 k/cm with the remainder of the CBC within normal limits. The metabolic panel revealed blood sugar of 398 and corresponding hyponatremia of 128 mmol/L. The chloride and bicarbonate were also low at 89 mmol/L and 21 mmol/L, respectively, yielding an elevated anion gap of 18. The patient also has had hypoalbuminemia with a value of 2.5 g/dL. Lactate was elevated at 2.8 mmol/L. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. Blood cultures were sent. The urinalysis demonstrated clear glycosuria with >500 mg/dL of glucose, as well as pyuria with 17 WBC per high power field. There was no ketonuria, leukoesterase, or elevated nitrates.\nAP and lateral radiographs of the left femur revealed mottled lucencies consistent with gas in the soft tissues of the medial thigh ().\nA duplex Doppler exam with real time grey-scale imaging, spectral Doppler with wave form analysis, color Doppler, and physiologic maneuvers including compression were done to evaluate the venous system of the left leg from the groin down through the popliteal fossa. Subcutaneous edema was noted in left thigh, but there was no sonographic evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\nThe patient's presentation was most concerning for gas gangrene versus necrotizing fasciitis. Patient looked remarkably well, despite the differential diagnosis. He was resuscitated with 4 L of NSS, 10 U of intravenous regular insulin, 1 g of intravenous Vancomycin, and 3.375 g of intravenous Piperacillin-Tazobactam. He was given 2 oxycodone tablets for analgesia. Patient's mentation remained intact throughout. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit where he underwent surgical debridement followed by hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. He also received diabetes education, as he was not taking his Metformin, but rather under the impression that he was doing a good job controlling his diabetes with diet. His decompensated diabetes was likely a contributing cause to his necrotizing fasciitis.

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 128.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 128.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 128.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 128.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 128.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 128.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 89.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 89.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 89.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 89.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 89.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 89.0 mEq chloride/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 128.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 18.0 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 18.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.5 (in g/dL)) = 21.75 mEq/L.

There is no fever, headaches are often felt since the last 6 months and usually do not improve even after taking analgetics, and patients also sometimes find it difficult to sleep. There is no cough and dyspnoea; the patient often feels pain in the right chest which only decreases after taking analgetics. Urination is smooth, but the volume of urine was less, irregular defecation as long as this complaint.\nPrevious medical history: the patient was treated at hospital with a diagnosis of moderate differentiation of invasive squamous cell esophageal carcinoma, suspected lung and brain metastases with electrolyte balance disorders. The patient received chemotherapy 13 times and radiotherapy 30 times during treatment at a hospital in another country six months ago. Laboratory results of the last serum sodium after chemotherapy is 124 mmol/L. One month before admission in our hospital, the patient received a total of 10 bottles of 3% sodium infusion in another hospital. The serum sodium levels after correction were 111 mmol/L, 112 mmol/L, and 117 mmol/L, respectively. There was no history of swelling, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease.\nPhysical examination found vital signs within normal limits, good consciousness, and body mass index (BMI) 18.4 kg/m2. No signs of anemia and jaundice, no palpable tumor mass, and no lymphadenopathy were found. Thoracic, cardiac, and abdominal physical examinations were within normal limits. There was no extremity edema and abdominal ascites.\nThe results of laboratory tests are as follows: leukocytes 4,600/mm3, erythrocytes 3.35 × 106/mm3, hemoglobin 10.6 gr/dL, hematocrit 28.5%, platelets 99,000/mm3, MCV 85.1 pg, MCHC 37.0 gr/dL, neutrophils 76.9%, lymphocytes 20.1%, RBG 156 mg/dL, ALT 17 U/L, AST 14 U/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea 26 mg/dL, sodium 117 mmol/L, potassium 3.2 mmol/L, clorida 83 mmol/L, and plasma osmolality 216 mMol/kg. Other examinations found normal electrocardiography and abdominal ultrasound within normal limit, except for cysts in the right kidney (6.5 × 5.7 mm). Histopathological examination of esophageal tumor tissue biopsy was moderate differentiation of invasive squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. Thoracic CT-scan impression was sicculer esophageal tumors as high as the middle third with a mark of adhesions with the posterior portion of the aorta, no metastasis to lymph nodes and lung. The impression of PET-CT scan results postradiotherapy was increased FDG uptake is seen at a long segment of the thoracic esophagus. In view of previous radiation, considerations include esophagitis versus residual tumor. No increase was seen at the right hilum. The previously seen coeliac axis node is much smaller and non-FDG-avid. There is no evidence of hypermetabolic hepatic metastasis. A tiny nodule in the lingula is nonspecific. Increased uptake is seen at the right parietal brain parenchyma. This may be related to recent fall versus metastasis.\nBased on the history, physical examination, laboratory, and radiography investigation, the initial working diagnosis was esophageal carcinoma with SIADH. Management at that time was correction of hyponatremia with NaCl 3% based on the calculation of the patient's requirement. During treatment, the patient always complains of feelings of weakness, nausea but no vomiting, no appetite, headache, insomnia, and right chest pain that is temporarily improving by giving analgesics. There was no coughing and dyspnoea. Urine production per day was between 350 and 600 cc and irregularly defecating. On physical examination, blood pressure fluctuates within normal limits but once blood pressure reaches 160/100 mmHg, the patient has experienced a decrease in consciousness with laboratory results of sodium at that time: 108 mmol/L.\nLaboratory results for four times electrolyte control tests after correction showed sodium levels of 108, 108, 122, and 112 mmol/L, respectively, never reached the normal levels although correction of sodium with 3% sodium based on the calculation of patient requirement was given repeatedly; low plasma osmolality and urine osmolality higher than the plasma osmolality were also found in this patient. Furthermore, the management of SIADH was given fluid restriction; hyponatremia was corrected with 3% sodium based on the calculation of the patient's requirement, injection of furosemide 40 mg intravenous daily, tetracycline 500 mg twice daily. We follow-up urine production daily, urine sodium, urine osmolality, and plasma osmolality.\nThe general condition of the patient improves; complaints often felt during hospitalization have diminished. Physical examination results: vital signs are within normal limits, and urine production increases around 1100 cc daily. Laboratory examination results: levels of sodium are 140 mmol/L. Results of urine examination are within normal limits (urine density: 1.010). The patient is permitted to outpatient with recommended continue oral therapy, calculate urine production daily, and electrolyte control. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? </Question>",

Physiotherapy, oral analgesics, and subacromial infiltrations showed no lasting effect. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an RCT of M. supraspinatus (Patte Grade I; Goutallier/Fuchs Type I) and M. subscapularis (Lafosse Type I) [, , ].\nThe patient underwent ARCR using a suture bridge-like construct (SpeedBridge™ [SB], Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) for rotator cuff repair as well as an LHB tenodesis through one BioComposite SwiveLock™ (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA). The cranial part of the partially torn subscapularis tendon was attached to the LHB anchor.\nAt 6-week follow-up, the patient showed an adequate range of passive motion and no signs of shoulder stiffness. Nine weeks postoperatively, the patient suffered a low-velocity trauma to his left shoulder. He presented to the emergency room with immobilizing pain rated 9/10 on the numeric analog scale. Radiographic examination (, ) and a computer tomography scan (CT, , ) revealed an isolated fracture of the proximal humeral head (AO/OTA fracture and dislocation classification 11C1.3) []. The fracture line was located right at the lateral site of the suture bridge construct close to the anatomic neck (Neer Type II, []). Due to a displacement of 1 cm, surgical refixation was advised.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fracture site was exposed using a delta split approach. Total reruptures of previously reconstructed rotator cuff tendons were detected, and anchor material was removed. The fracture was reduced, and definitive fixation was performed with a PHILOS™-Plate system (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). Rotator cuff tendons were reconstructed and additionally attached to the plate through Ethibond® fibers (Ethicon, Somerville, Massachusetts) in Mason-Allen technique.\nPost-operative radiographs showed good reduction of the fracture so that post-operative rehabilitation following a standardized protocol was initiated ().\nAt 3-month follow-up, the fracture healed anatomically with the patient’s passive range of motion already within normal limits. Constant score was 68 and improved to 92 points at 1-year and 2-year follow-up.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1. The patient is 55 years old.  The concentration of creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL.  The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. The patient's height is 176.0 cm, which is 176.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.76 m. The patient's weight is 88.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 88.0 kg / (1.76 m * 1.76 m) = 28.409 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 28.4, indicating they are overweight/obese. Because the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight). The patient's gender is Male. The patient's height is 176.0 cm, which is 176.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 69.291 in.  For males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60) Plugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (69.291 (in inches) - 60) = 71.369 kg. Hence, the patient's IBW is 71.369 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight). To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 71.369 kg + 0.4 * (88.0 kg  - 71.369 kg) = 78.021 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 78.021 kg.  Using the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Plugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 55) * 78.021 * 1) / (1.1 * 72) = 83.735 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 83.735 mL/min.",

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of intermittent asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department (ED) via ambulance status post fall in the context of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. Initially in the ED the patient was urinating on the floor, attempting to fight staff members, and uncooperative with examination. Intravenous haloperidol 5 mg and midazolam 4 mg were administered for agitation, after which the patient was able to tolerate medical evaluation and management. Additional history was limited at this time given the patient’s intoxicated state. The patient was unable to participate in a formal review of systems given his altered mental status (AMS). Initial vital signs were blood pressure 146/83 mm Hg, pulse 104 beats per minute, temperature 98.4 °F, respiratory rate 18 breath per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Physical examination was grossly normal aside from a 3 cm stellate forehead laceration. Apart from a leukocytosis of 15 K/mm3, complete blood count, and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Pertinent normal laboratory test results included a sodium of 140 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 15, and a creatinine of 0.87 mg/dL. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and PCP. Urinalysis was positive for only bacteria and nitrites along with 6 to 9 epithelial cells per high-power field suggesting possible contamination. Urine cultures were not obtained. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated left zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without acute intracranial pathology. CT imaging of the patient’s cervical spine did not demonstrate any acute pathology. While in the ED, the patient’s forehead laceration was sutured. The patient was admitted to an inpatient medicine unit for further management of his AMS and facial fracture.\nOn admission, the patient was somnolent, oriented only to self, and unable to engage with the admission assessment. An extensive AMS workup was completed, which included ammonia, vitamin B12 and folate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood cultures, C-reactive protein, repeat comprehensive metabolic panel/complete blood count, syphilis screen, and repeat head CT. Aside from a mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 2.6 mg/dL and leukocytosis of 14.2 K/mm3 the remainder of the patient’s laboratory test results was within normal limits. Specific laboratory tests of interest pertinent to a delirium workup returned within normal limits as follows: ammonia 15 µmol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.4, vitamin B12 576 pg/mL, and folate 22.9 ng/mL. The differential diagnosis for the patient’s AMS remained wide, so he was placed on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol and started on intravenous thiamine as a history of alcohol use could not be ruled out. The patient was also given a 3-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone considering equivocal urinalysis findings. Plastic surgery was consulted and recommended nonemergent elective repair of the facial fractures, but treatment was deferred as the patient remained altered and could not consent to the procedure.\nPer family collateral, the patient worked part-time as a mechanic, lived alone, performed all activities of daily living independently, and did not have any history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Family was unable to provide any additional information regarding the patient’s substance use. The patient did not receive any additional lorazepam per Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol or for vital sign abnormalities consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Aside from his tachycardia on initial presentation in the ED, the patient did not demonstrate tachycardia after admission to the inpatient medicine unit. On the third hospital day, the patient’s AMS persisted, and neurology was consulted and evaluated the patient for additional causes of encephalopathy.\nOn the consulting neurologist’s initial examination, the patient remained lethargic, oriented only to self, unable to follow complex commands, and hypophonic with increased speech latency. No focal cranial nerve deficit was appreciated; however, the patient exhibited hypertonicity with significant oppositional paratonias in all 4 extremities along with bilaterally upgoing plantar reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were ordered per neurology recommendations. EEG did not demonstrate epileptiform activity or generalized slowing. However, MRI revealed a restricted diffusion/focal hyperintensity within the splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, respectively. MRI findings on FLAIR, DWI, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) are highlighted in . In consideration of the patient’s recent exposure to neuroleptics, persistent encephalopathy, and significant oppositional paratonias, the possibility of an atypical variant of NMS contributing to the patient’s delirium was likely. Despite the likelihood of atypical NMS, in considering the wide differential diagnosis of callosal lesions the probability of the MRI lesion representing a new infarct remained. Therefore, the patient was placed on standing aspirin 325 mg along with atorvastatin 40 mg daily. CT angiography of the head and neck was completed and was unremarkable. The patient was also started on standing benztropine 1 mg twice daily for atypical NMS. Of note, lorazepam was not used as there was concern for additional central nervous system depression in an already somnolent and delirious patient.\nBy the seventh hospital day, the patient became more alert, had improved orientation, was able to complete 2 step commands with prompting, and had reduced cogwheeling on examination. Additionally, the patient’s leukocytosis had down-trended to 13.2 K/mm3. The scheduled benztropine was also discontinued. The patient did not require any physical restraints or tranquilizers for agitation after admission. The patient’s MRI was repeated 11 days after initial imaging, which redemonstrated the corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and without restricted diffusion on DWI. The patient was instructed to repeat imaging as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of subacute callosal infarct versus transient splenial lesion of another etiology. The patient was recommended to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility to further manage his physical deconditioning and was subsequently lost to follow-up. </Context> <Question> Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? </Question>",

Her medical history consisted of essential hypertension, atrial fibrillation, abdominal aortic aneurysm, sick sinus syndrome, asthma, and gout. She reported that her back pain started after she came back from the bathroom at 4 : 00 a.m. while trying to sit down on the bed. The patient described the pain as shooting in nature, severe in intensity, and radiating down her left arm with no clear exacerbating or relieving factors. Over the following few minutes, she developed progressive weakness in her left lower and upper extremities and later on became unable to move her left leg which led to her being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. She also developed numbness in her left leg up to the level of the knee and in her left arm up to the level of the shoulder. There was no history of any urinary or stool incontinence or retention or any previous similar episodes.\nThe patient had been recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation one month prior to presentation in an outside hospital and had since been maintained on apixaban 1 tablet 5 mg twice daily. Her other home medications included alprazolam, allopurinol, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. She reported full compliance with her medications prior to presentation. A dual chamber pacemaker was inserted 11 days before this visit in an outside hospital, and her other surgical history included a hysterectomy several years ago for uterine fibroids. She denied any history of smoking, alcohol abuse, or illicit substances usage. The patient did not have previous bleeding history.\nThe patient's vital signs on presentation were within normal limits, and her neurological exam showed a patient alert and oriented to time, place, and person with intact speech. Her motor power was 5/5 in her right upper extremity proximally and 4/5 distally and 3/5 in her left upper extremity proximally and 1/5 distally. In her lower extremities, the motor power was 5/5 on the right and 1/5 all over on the left. She had decreased sensation to light touch in her left upper and lower extremities. She had no clonus, and Hoffman and Babinski signs were negative bilaterally. Her reflexes were 2+ all over and symmetric.\nInitial lab tests were significant for hypokalemia (3.1 mmol/L), leukocytosis (12700 WBCs per microliter), and slight anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dl with unknown baseline. Her other lab tests including liver function and renal function were within normal limits.\nGiven her presentation of acute focal neurological deficit, a noncontrast head CT scan was ordered and showed signs of chronic vascular ischemic disease only. The patient continued to have severe back pain, and having a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, an acute aortic dissection was suspected, and hence, a CT angiogram of the abdomen, pelvis, and thorax was ordered. The CT angiogram did not show any signs of aortic dissection. A CT scan of the neck was performed to investigate the cause of the left upper extremity weakness and numbness. It showed an epidural soft tissue density extending along the left aspect of the spinal canal causing compression and marked rightward deviation of the cord concerning for an epidural hematoma extending from C2-C3 level to C6-C7 ().\nAs the patient was on apixaban at the time, a decision was made to delay surgical treatment for 2 days to decrease the risk of intraoperative bleeding. A C2-C7 laminectomy, hematoma exclusion, and spinal fusion were then performed. On discharge, 9 days later, her physical exam was mostly unchanged from that on presentation except for the resolution of pain and improvement in motor power in her left lower extremity from 1/5 to 2/5 distally. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? </Question>",

She has never smoked and had no history of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus or other cardiovascular disease. About 20 days before admission, the patient suffered from fever, cough, sputum and dyspnea. She visited another hospital and was treated with antibiotics and steroids. Despite treatment, there was no clinical improvement of her symptoms. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nOn admission, her body temperature was 37.2°C, pulse rate was 110/min, respiration rate was 24/min and blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg. Physical examination revealed bilateral diffuse inspiratory crackle without wheezing. Laboratory tests were performed: white blood cell count was 48,220/μL (neutrophils were 98%, monocytes 1% and lymphocytes 1%), hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 32.1% and platelet count 394,000/μL on complete blood cell counts. Arterial blood gas analysis findings were pH 7.497, PaCO2 42.5 mmHg, PaO2 63.4 mmHg, bicarbonate 32.6 mmol/L and oxygen saturation 93.3% on oxygen 3 L/min via nasal prong.

Chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed multifocal variable-sized consolidation with reticulonodular opacities () and cavitary lesion in both upper lobes and right lower lobe. There were also multiple small nodular densities and ground glass attenuation around the consolidation ().\nMicroscopic examination of sputum showed no acid-fast bacilli. Other laboratory findings, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE PRIST, C3, C4, CH50, rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antistreptolysin-O (ASO), VDRL and cold cryoglobulin, were all negative.\nDespite empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroid treatment, dyspnea progressively aggravated. Open lung biopsy was done on the tenth hospital day. Histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen showed large areas of necrotizing pneumonia with an infarct-like appearance (). There were some scattered fungal hyphae within the lung parenchyma (). The bronchi and bronchioles often showed dilated lumen which were filled with mucus, numerous necrotic debris, inflammatory cells and branching septated hyphae characteristic of aspergillus. Some terminal bronchioles were found to be destroyed and were replaced by granulomatous inflammation (). The bronchocentric granulomatous reaction extended into the adjacent lung parenchyma to a degree. Gomori-Methenamine-Silver (GMS) staining revealed many fungal hyphae consistent with aspergillus species. There was no evidence of angioinvasion by aspergillus or aspergillous emboli. With an impression of invasive aspergillus infection with BCG-like elements, 15 mg of amphotericin-B once day was administered intravenously and the dose was increased up to 30 mg daily. Steroids was tapered progressively. There were some improvement in her clinical symptoms. However despite vigorous antifungal treatment, sudden respiratory arrest occurred due to acute tracheobronchial tree obstruction with bronchial casts on the thirty-fourth hospital day.

To convert 48220.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 48220.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 48220000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 42.5 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met. Hence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3.",

    "problem": "<Context> A 28-year-old Japanese woman had infertility, with G5 P1, but not antiphospholipid syndrome. Owing to protein S deficiency, she was treated with aspirin 100 mg per day and heparin therapy, which was discontinued because of a subchorionic hematoma at 12 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks, she presented with proteinuria and edema in the lower extremities and was transferred to another hospital. A high dose of oral glucocorticoids (prednisolone, 40 mg) was initiated for presumed primary glomerulonephritis before 20 weeks of gestation with severe hypoalbuminemia (1.8 g/dL) and severe proteinuria (10 g/gCre) were suspected. In addition, 40 mg of nifedipine per day and 750 mg of methyldopa hydrate per day were administered for hypertension. Her condition failed to improve, and bilateral pleural effusion appeared. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital at 21 weeks and 3 days of gestation.\nHer medical history was unremarkable, except for infertility. Her birthweight was within the normal range (3260 g). Her height was 156 cm, blood pressure was not high at 128/91 mmHg, and she weighed 53.3 kg. She had remarkable edema in her lower extremities. She did not have sclerodactyly. Laboratory test results were as follows. Serum total protein and albumin levels were very low at 4.9 and 2.2 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine and uric acid were slightly high at 0.65 and 6.9 mg/dL, respectively, owing to her gestation. Serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were 510, 329, and 439 mg/dL, respectively. C-reactive protein was 0.37 mg/dL, and urine protein content was 5.6 g/day, with no hematuria. Antinuclear antibody was low titer (1:40), and anti-centromere antibody was positive at 29.3 IU/mL. In addition, anti-dsDNA, anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody, and anti-phospholipid IgG antibody, lupus anticoagulant were negative. Serum IgG, IgA, C3, and C4 levels were 131, 85, 64, and 10 mg/dL, respectively. Serum IgM and IgE levels were 139 and 133 mg/dL, respectively. Further, protein S activity was in the normal range (95%) in our hospital.\nShe met the criteria for nephrotic syndrome. However, it was difficult to diagnose primary nephrotic syndrome due to PE before 20 weeks without kidney biopsy. Therefore, we examined serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) levels since the ratio of sFlt-1/PlGF (> 36) in pregnant women have been demonstrated as a predictor of PE []. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio turned out to be very high (sFlt-1, 13,400 pg/mL; PlGF, 21.9 pg/mL; serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio 611.9), so that we diagnosed her nephrotic syndrome because of PE, and we discontinued oral glucocorticoids. We used furosemide and human albumin solution, however, her fetal growth curve was lower than 2 standard deviation after 21 weeks (Fig. ) and, further, she had a reflux of uterine artery blood flow. Therefore, she had a cesarean section at 24 weeks 3 days. Five weeks after delivery, we performed a kidney biopsy. The core kidney tissue contained 21 glomeruli without global sclerosis. Two of the 21 glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerotic lesions, with epithelial cell hyperplasia and foam cells in the tubular poles (Fig. a, b). In addition, spike formations and bubbly appearances of the glomerular basement membrane were absent (Fig. c). In addition, hyaline arteriolosclerosis and intimal thickening in the interlobular arteries were not found (Fig. d).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining demonstrated diffuse, linear, peripheral patterns of C4d, slight paramesangial patterns of IgM and negative results for IgG, IgA, C3, and C1q. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse subendothelial edema without electron-dense deposits. Further, diffuse foot process effacement was not observed (Fig. ). The histological diagnosis was severe glomerular endotheliosis with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesions. For the histology of the placenta, hemorrhagic infarction around the umbilical cord and syncytial knots were consistent with PE (Fig. ). As shown in her whole clinical course (Fig. ), 8 months after delivery, her proteinuria disappeared completely without anti-hypertensive agents, which was also compatible with PE. The neonate was diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome, rickets, and retinopathy. His weight increased from 303 g to 2806 g 171 days after birth. </Context> <Question> Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg? </Question>",

Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, myelodysplastic syndrome with chronic anemia, cerebrovascular accident, chronic kidney disease, peptic ulcer disease, peripheral vascular disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient reported a previous “hypersensitivity” to warfarin six years earlier at a different institution. Medications included aspirin 81 mg PO daily, isosorbide mononitrate 40 mg PO daily, furosemide 10 mg alternating with 20 mg PO daily, ramipril 10 mg PO daily, amiodarone 200 mg PO daily, atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily, metoprolol 25 mg PO daily, multiple vitamin PO daily, insulin glargine 14 units subcutaneously daily, epoetin alfa 40,000 units subcutaneously weekly, levothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily, calcitriol 0.25 mcg alternating with 0.5 mcg PO daily, and polysaccharide iron complex 150 mg PO twice daily. Due to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation, the patient was initiated on warfarin (Jantoven) at 2 mg PO daily with an international normalized ratio (INR) goal of 2.0–3.0 which would indicate the appropriate level of anticoagulation for this patient.\nThe timeline of the subsequent clinical course is outlined in . Three days after initiation of warfarin, the patient's INR was 1.4 and the dose remained unchanged. Six days later the patient's INR was 9.1, so warfarin was held and phytonadione (vitamin K) 2.5 mg PO was administered as an antidote to counteract the excessive anticoagulation. One day later the INR had fallen to 4.6, and no additional vitamin K was administered. However, three days later the INR had risen to 7.9, and the patient reported bleeding from her left hand for one hour after accidentally hitting it. As a result, vitamin K was administered a second time at a dose of 5 mg PO. Two days later the INR had decreased to 1.8, yet the patient reported her lip bleeding for approximately 30 minutes after accidentally biting it. Two days later the INR had risen to 3.8, and the patient reported her elbow bleeding for an undetermined period of time after injuring it. Vitamin K was then administered a third time at a dose of 2.5 mg PO. Three days later, the INR had risen to 4.0 and vitamin K was administered a fourth time at a dose of 5 mg PO. Upon subsequent follow-up the INR had decreased to 1.3 after two more days and increased to 1.8 over the next two days, but it then decreased three days later to 1.7. At this time, the decision was made to not restart warfarin due to the supratherapeutic response and to increase the aspirin dose to 325 mg PO daily.\nDue to this hypersensitivity to warfarin, the patient consented to genetic testing which revealed CYP2C9*3*3 and VKORC1-1639 AA genotypes. The patient received a second opinion, and it was decided to restart warfarin to decrease risks of a thromboembolic event. Seven months after the previous discontinuation of warfarin, a baseline INR of 1.0 confirmed that the patient's untreated INR was not elevated. Warfarin was then reinitiated at 0.5 mg PO two times weekly and slowly titrated up to 0.5 mg PO daily over the next three months to achieve therapeutic INRs. No hemorrhages were reported during this time.\nThis study was approved by the Shenandoah University Institutional Review Board. The patient signed an informed consent and provided a cheek swab sample for DNA collection at the time of a scheduled appointment. Genomic DNA was isolated from the cheek swab sample using a Qiagen QiaCube automated DNA isolation instrument (Qiagen Inc, Chatsworth, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol and then frozen at −20°C until the time of genotyping. The DNA sample was genotyped for CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853), *3 (rs1057910), *5 (rs28371686), *6 (rs9332131), *7 (rs67807361), *8 (rs7900194), *9 (rs2256871), *11 (rs28371685), *12 (rs9332239), *13 (rs72558187), and VKORC1-1639 G > A (rs9923231).

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L.

    "Lower Limit": "287.86",
    "Upper Limit": "318.162",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL. The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L.  The concentration of bun is 8.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 8.6 mmol. To convert 8.6 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 8.6 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.009 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.009 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.252 g bun. To convert 0.252 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.252 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 252.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 252.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 25.2 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 8.6 mmol bun/L converts to 25.2 mg bun/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 11.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 11.6 mmol. To convert 11.6 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 11.6 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.012 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.012 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.162 g glucose. To convert 2.162 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.162 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2162.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2162.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 216.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 11.6 mmol glucose/L converts to 216.2 mg glucose/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 141.0 + (25.2 / 2.8) + (25.2 / 18) = 303.011 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 303.011 mmol/L.

The patient was not amenable to digital rectal examination due to reported pain. However, illuminated visual examination of the rectum did not reveal any abnormalities. Due to the constellation of travel history, cough, and constitutional symptoms, a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. It revealed biapical pleural thickening associated with parenchymal scarring, bronchiectasis, nodularity, and superimposed infiltrates (). Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was highly suspected, and the patient was placed in an isolation room. Further imaging was accomplished with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast. This revealed acute appendicitis in the right lower quadrant congruent with earlier physical examination findings (). It also revealed a 3.1 × 1.9 cm dumbbell-shaped loculated fluid collection anterior to the anus consistent with perirectal abscess () confirming the etiology of his rectal discomfort. Finally, CT gave more insight into suspected pulmonary TB as it revealed nodular and patchy consolidation in both lung bases along with dense consolidation, fluffy airspace infiltrates, distended, and distorted bronchi ().\nThe patient was taken to the operating room expeditiously where he underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), laparoscopic appendectomy, and incision and drainage of the perirectal abscess.

Cultures from the perirectal abscess were also positive for beta-hemolytic group C streptococcus. Gross pathology of the appendix revealed a dusky, congested, red-brown serosa. When sectioned, we appreciated a dilated lumen measuring approximately 0.5 cm in diameter and an appendiceal wall thickness averaging at 0.3 cm. The mucosa was noted to be tan-pink, glistening, and congested. The lumen of the appendix contained abundant gray-pink semisolid contents. A discrete perforation was not appreciated. Histologic analysis revealed a focally effaced mucosa albeit where present, the epithelium was without atypia. Foci of acute and granulomatous inflammation were appreciated () along with epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells (). Initial acid-fast staining was negative, but a repeat stain revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the cytoplasm of a multinucleated giant cell ().\nThe patient was started on antitubercular drugs that included a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

Body temperature was 36.2°C. Results of pulmonary function tests including vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and FEV1/forced vital capacity were within normal range. The FEV1 did not change by bronchodilator inhalation. Her diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide was not measured. Blood gas analysis under ambient air showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 39.5 Torr, PaO2 of 79.4 Torr, and HCO3- of 25.2 mmol/L. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC), 4000/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.5 g/dL; platelets, 22.4 × 104/mm3; serum total protein, 7.5 g/dL; albumin, 4.2 g/dL; creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL; Na, 141 mmol/L; Cl, 104 mmol/L; K, 4.2 mmol/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 234 IU/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 0.1 mg/dL; KL-6, 316 U/mL; IgE, 385 IU/mL; β-D-glucan, 30.5 pg/mL (normal range <11 pg/mL); and Aspergillus antigen (galactomannan antigen), 6.4. Serum anti-Trichosporon asahii antibody, IgA antibodies against Mycobacterium avium, and interferon-gamma releasing assay were all negative. Chest X-ray (Fig. A) showed no abnormal shadows, but computed tomography (Fig. B) showed ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules in both upper lobes.\nBronchoalveolar lavage could not recover a sufficient amount of saline, and transbronchial lung biopsy showed alveolitis without granuloma formation. A. oryzae was cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum precipitating antibody against A. oryzae was positive. A. oryzae was repeatedly isolated from her factory. After admission, her symptoms improved, and her PaO2 under ambient air improved to 97.5 Torr, although pulmonary function tests remained unchanged. The ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules on computed tomography (CT) improved (Fig. C), and her serum β-D-glucan value decreased to <11 pg/mL. Thereafter, she returned to her factory, after which her cough relapsed, her PaO2 decreased to 79.7 Torr, and she redeveloped centrilobular nodules on chest CT (Fig. D). Although her WBC counts and serum CRP values did not worsen, we diagnosed her as having HP due to A. oryzae. Her serum β-D-glucan value was elevated to 28.8 pg/mL. She has stopped working at the factory, but her family has continued to brew koji. She continues to be followed on an outpatient basis, and her HP has not relapsed. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? </Question>",
    "Lower Limit": "0.554",
    "Upper Limit": "0.612",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L). To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)). The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 141.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 141.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 141.0 mEq sodium/L.  The concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L.  The concentration of bicarbonate is 25.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 25.2 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 25.2 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 25.2 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 25.2 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 25.2 mEq bicarbonate/L.  Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 25.2 mEq/L) = 11.8 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.8 mEq/L. The concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 11.8 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2 (in g/dL)) = 11.3 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 11.3 mEq/L. Plugging in 11.3 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 11.3 - 12 = -0.7 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -0.7 mEq/L. Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -0.7 mEq/L / -1.1999999999999993 mEq/L = 0.583. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.583.",

The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mEq. To convert from 137.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 137.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 137.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 137.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 137.0 mmol sodium/L.  The concentration of bun is 17.0 mg/dL.  The concentration of glucose is 123.0 mg/dL.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 137.0 + (17.0 / 2.8) + (17.0 / 18) = 286.905 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 286.905 mmol/L.

    "problem": "<Context> A 42-year-old Caucasian female, gravida 3 para 1 (1 spontaneous vaginal delivery and 2 elective abortions), was admitted with a 2-month history of diffuse abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, weakness, and a twenty-pound unintentional weight loss. Her history was significant for a twenty-eight-pack-year tobacco use and a copper IUD placed approximately fifteen years earlier.\nOn admission, the patient was found to be cachectic, tachycardic, and tachypneic but afebrile. Her abdomen was moderately distended, tender to palpation throughout but without acute peritoneal signs. It was diffusely tympanic but dull over bilateral lower quadrants, with hypoactive bowel sounds. External genitalia and vagina were normal. Cervix was parous in appearance with two strings visualized from the cervical os; IUD was removed and sent for microbiologic studies. Uterus was difficult to palpate secondary to pain and adnexal tenderness. Adnexa were diffusely tender with bilateral fullness. Rectal exam showed normal tone and normal rectovaginal septum with fullness palpated anteriorly.\nThe patient's initial laboratory evaluation showed marked leukocytosis (WBC: 29,000), anemia (Hgb: 10.9), hypoalbuminemia (albumin: 2.2), and mildly elevated CA 125 (54). AST/ALT, CEA, and CA 19-9 were normal. No infectious disease was found per evaluation via urine and blood cultures, gonorrhea, chlamydia, vaginitis panel (testing for trichomoniasis, candida, and bacterial vaginosis), tuberculin test, HIV, or hepatitis B and hepatitis C.\nCT of the abdomen demonstrated marked bowel distention and a complex cystic mass within the left pelvis with enhancing septations measuring 8.2 × 6.7 × 9.8 cm, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and small ascites with peritoneal enhancement. Large distended bowel loops surrounded the heterogeneous lesion peripherally ().\nParenteral antibiotics (Meropenem and Vancomycin) were started for coverage of pelvic abscess of unknown etiology with noted improvement in leukocytosis after 72 hours. Nasogastric tube was placed for upper GI decompression and control of emesis for suspected partial small bowel obstruction. Total parenteral nutrition was also started to improve her malnourished state. Gynecologic oncology was consulted and concluded that the likelihood of carcinomatosis was very low based on the patient's age, absence of omental caking or peritoneal implants on CT, and only mildly elevated CA-125. In the presence of a neglected IUD for 15 years with low suspicion for malignancy, actinomycosis was a likely diagnosis. CT-guided diagnostic paracentesis was performed after bowel decompression was achieved with NG tube. Purulent peritoneal fluid was obtained which was negative for malignancy, yet positive for Actinomyces (). Copper IUD was removed and culture grew Micromonas micros and Actinomyces ().\nOne week after initiation of antibiotic therapy, repeat CT of abdomen and pelvis showed stable to slightly improved fluid collections compared to prior exams. As final laboratory diagnosis was achieved, Vancomycin and Meropenem were discontinued after 8 and 11 days of treatment, respectively.\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin-Sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours, which helped control her leukocytosis. On day five of the Ampicillin-Sulbactam, AST and ALT values were 209 and 148, respectively, and patient was diagnosed with transaminitis secondary to the Ampicillin-Sulbactam. The Ampicillin-Sulbactam was discontinued, which improved the transaminitis, and the patient was started on Penicillin 3 million units IV every 4 hours, which was continued for a total of 4 weeks.\nAfter 3 weeks of in-hospital management, patient was tolerating regular diet with regular bowel movements and improved pain control. Patient was discharged home with close outpatient follow-up arranged. At her outpatient follow-up four weeks later, she was transitioned to Penicillin 500 mg PO four times daily. Patient continued Penicillin orally for 1 year, during which she was gaining the strength and weight back with assistance of nutrition and occupational therapy professionals.\nRepeat CT of abdomen and pelvis 1 year after initiation of treatment demonstrated complete resolution of bowel distention, ascites, and adenopathy; the left adnexal mass had more than 50% size reduction, measuring 3.9 × 3.2 cm ().

He was born to nonconsanguineous parents, the birth weight was 2.8 kg and he had normal early physical and mental milestones. He was able to stand and walk at 10 months, but within next few weeks he was unable to walk and stand even with support. A frontal bossing, potbelly appeared and there was a failure to gain height. He received calcitriol 0.25 μg on alternate days and elemental calcium 1 g /day, but showed no improvement.\nOn examination, he was irritable and blood pressure was 100/65 mmHg. He had no edema or pallor and anterior frontanelle was still open. He had classical features of rickets [] such as frontal bossing, widened epiphysis at wrist, rickety rosary, potbelly and bowlegs. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Anthropometry showed height 73 cm, (5th percentile), weight 9 kg (5th percentle), head circumference 48 cm (between 75 and 90th percentile).\nLaboratory evaluation showed the following: Urine albumin-trace, sugar-nil, microscopy-no sediments; Hemoglobin 12.3 g/dl, Blood urea 21 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.3 mg/ dl, serum sodium 137 mEq/l, serum potassium 3.4 mEq/l, serum chloride 99 mEq/l, serum bicarbonate 22 mEq/l, serum calcium 8.9 mg/dl, serum phosphate 2.0 mg/ dl (normal values for children: 4.5-6.5 mg/ dl), serum alkaline phosphatase 3966 IU/l and serum intact PTH 26.5 pg/ml (normal: 10-54).

She visited the outpatient clinic after 10 d and was transferred to the emergency center because of severe lower left abdominal pain on 2 d before her scheduled admission. She had nausea, vomiting, and non-whirling dizziness. She was diagnosed with colonic cancer perforation with an abscess and was admitted for antibiotic treatment. We ensured that the acute septic condition was stabilized, and the patient underwent operation.\nShe had no co-morbid disease.\nOn digital rectal examination, a circumferential fungating mass with a central ulceration was palpated 8 cm from the anal verge, and it was fixed in the pelvic cavity. In the emergency center, the patient’s body temperature was 38.9 °C. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 110 mmHg and 70 mmHg respectively, pulse rate was 78 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\nLaboratory results were as follows: White blood cell count (23900/µL; 93.9% of neutrophil), hemoglobin (11.6 g/dL), platelet count (416000/µL), C-reactive protein (16.14 mg/dL), lipase (9 IU/L), albumin (3.2 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase (265 IU/L), sodium (132 mEq/L), chloride (93 mEq/L), and prothrombin time percentage (73.2%).\nChest X-ray showed a nodule in the right upper lung field. Besides this, there was no active lesion in the lungs. Colonoscopy revealed a huge submucosal mass-like lesion with focal ulceration located 8 to 15 cm from the anal verge. Abdominopelvic CT showed a poorly marginated mass measuring 7.4 cm × 6.3 cm × 5.5 cm in size located between the rectum and uterus and separated from the uterus by fat tissues. The mass had focal non-enhancing lesions without lymph node enlargement. To rule out the origin of the mass, the patient underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the operation. MRI revealed an exophytic growing mass with a maximum diameter of 7.2 cm at the right lateral wall of the rectum with an internal cystic portion and hemorrhage, multiple lymph node enlargement at the iliac bifurcations, obturator, and presacral areas, and a 2.2-cm-sized multiseptated cystic mass in the fundus of uterus (Figure ). Positron emission tomography-CT revealed a high possibility of a malignant tissue with a hypermetabolic mass (SUVmax = 15.1) and cystic changes in the rectum, and this lesion was considered to directly invade the adjacent uterus. Multifocal FDG uptake (SUVmax = 4.0) was observed in the left common iliac, perirectal area, and presacral area (Figure ).\nThe tumor was a polypoid mass measuring 10 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in size, and it invaded left ovary and salpinx via the serosal membrane (Figure ). No lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion was observed. Microscopically, the tumor was a cellular mass that had a solid growth pattern with few glandular structures and many foci of intratumoral necrosis. Tumor cells had elongated nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures, including atypical ones, were also frequently observed. At the boundary between the tumor and normal tissue, tumor cells were arranged in a palisading pattern, resembling basal cell carcinomas of the skin (Figure ). Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the tumor cells were focally positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, p63, and Pan-CK and were negative for CK20; neuroendocrine markers, such as synaptophysin and CD56; and mesenchymal cell markers, including CD34, CD117, desmin, S100 protein, and α-smooth muscle actin.

This abdominal pain was described as “achy,” 5/10, intermittent, and located in the left lower quadrant without radiation. She denied nausea or vomiting and had no diarrhea or blood in her stools. Review of systems revealed that the patient had symptoms of dysuria for one day and left-sided flank pain along with her abdominal pain. She denied fevers or chills. She stated that, despite taking her prescribed insulin injections, her blood sugars have been persistently elevated above 400 with her personal glucometer. Her past medical history was significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She denied ever having any surgeries. She used regular insulin, Lantus (insulin glargine), and Ibuprofen. Her family history was noncontributory, and she denied alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.\nPhysical exam revealed a temperature of 36.5° C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/81 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and capillary blood glucose of 447 mg/dL. She was awake, alert, and interacting appropriately. Her pupils were equally round and reactive to light. The cardiac exam was normal and lungs were clear with breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness to palpation in the left periumbilical and left lower quadrant. There was no guarding or rebound. Extremities were warm and well-perfused. The neurological exam revealed no deficit.\nThe metabolic panel revealed sodium of 132 mEq/L (normal 135–145), BUN of 45 mg/dL (normal 8–22), Creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (normal 0.5–1.3), glucose of 473 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 8.0. A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/MM3 (normal 4.5–11.0) and a manual differential with 10.10 K/MM3 Neutrophils (normal 0.80–7.70). The hepatic panel was remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 189 U/L (normal 35–115). The urine was visibly clear and non-turbid. Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase and nitrate negative, but revealed large occult blood, glucosuria, protein of 300 mg/DL, and 3–6 WBC/HPF (normal 0–3).\nWhile laboratory studies were pending, the patient received one liter IV normal saline, four mg of morphine sulfate IV for pain, and 10 units of regular insulin. Despite fluid administration and analgesia, the patient continued to have worsening 6/10 abdominal pain. Given the patient’s presentation of undifferentiated abdominal pain without clear etiology and her immunocompromised state, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered. The CT scan revealed significant air in the bladder wall and lumen consistent with EC, severe left hydroureter and hydronephrosis without evidence of stones, and significant left perinephric stranding without gas in the renal parenchyma ().\nA gram of Ceftriaxone and 500 mg of Gentamycin were started empirically along with a repeat fluid bolus and placement of a Foley catheter. While awaiting consultation and admission to the Urology service, the patient complained of increased abdominal pain and was increasingly tender in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic region. Her heart rate was persistently tachycardic (in the 130s), and she developed a fever to 39.4°C. In light of developing urosepsis and the potential for rapid progression to Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Interventional Radiology (IR) was consulted and placed a left nephrostomy tube to relieve the functional obstruction of the urinary tract just eight hours after the patient presented to the ED. After nephrostomy tube placement by IR, the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The urine culture grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and the patient was continued on IV antibiotics. Three days after admission, the nephrostomy tube was removed as the patient was able to void without use of a foley catheter and was able to control her pain.

The saturated oxygen is greater than or equal to 95% and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 1. The patient note does not report a status on 'unilateral leg swelling'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 1. The patient note reports 'hemoptysis' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 1.

No other symptoms were reported.\nOn physical examination, pulse rate was 100 beats/min, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Lung auscultation was normal. Cardiac sounds were normal with no murmurs. He did not have clubbing. His oxygen saturation was lower when supine (platypnea). Rest of physical examination was unremarkable. ABGs analysis revealed hypoxemia (pH: 7.45, pCO2: 36 mmHg, pO2: 68 mmHg, HCO3: 25 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%). Routine laboratory investigations were normal. Hemoglobin was 11.1 g/dL. Liver and renal panels as well as inflammatory markers were within normal limits. The patient was suspected to have meningitis and was admitted to the Special Infections Unit. A brain CT revealed an enlargement of the left temporal horn. Lumbar puncture was performed and results from the cerebrospinal fluid analysis were 300 red blood cells/mm3, 5,800 nuclear cells/mm3, 30% lymphocytes, and 70% polymorphonuclear cells. Glucose was 41 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 34 U/L, and cerebrospinal fluid albumin 108 g/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed normal cell count and low protein levels. In addition, glucose was 101 mg/dL (serum concentration was 115 mg/dL) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Gram stain and culture were negative for bacteria or bacterial and/or viral DNA and/or RNA. Chest radiograph was noticeable for three nodules in the right lung.\nA subsequently post-IV contrast CT revealed numerous (>15) PAVMs in both lungs with the largest located in the right middle lobe and the superior segmental of the right lower lobe. They were perfused by branches of the pulmonary artery and had large draining veins (diameter~20 mm) (Figure ).\nA brain MRI was consistent with the diagnosis of a brain abscess with peripheral edema and hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe (Figure ).\nThe largest one (12 mm) was located beside the interhemispheric fissure and was radiologically similar to those of a cavernous hemangioma. In addition, a more detailed history confirmed episodes of spontaneous nose bleeding and a first-degree relative with HHT (two out of three criteria for the diagnosis of HHT).\nA contrast-enhanced pulmonary and abdominal aorta angiography was performed which confirmed the imaging findings of chest CT.

    "problem": "<Context> A 56-year-old El-Salvadorian male with no past medical history presented to our hospital with new-onset left-sided weakness involving the upper and lower extremities with difficulty speaking of 2 h duration. Upon arrival at the hospital, his vital signs were unremarkable. On physical examination, he scored 9 points on the NIH stroke scale (left facial droop, left upper extremity weakness, left lower extremity weakness, left-sided paresthesia, dysarthria, and extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation). Laboratory investigations showed LDL of 115 mg/dL and a normal hemoglobin A1C. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium showed an acute infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory (shown in Fig. ) along with old cortical infarcts in the left frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes and an old left cerebellar infarct (shown in Fig. ). Brain magnetic resonance arteriogram without contrast showed no large vessel occlusion/stenosis or aneurysmal changes. The patient subsequently received intravenous alteplase and was admitted to the hospital for monitoring and further stroke workup. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with bifascicular block. Carotid duplex was unremarkable. A 2D echocardiogram was obtained and demonstrated borderline reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 50–55%; the apex was not well imaged, and no signs for left ventricular hypertrophy were seen. Repeat echocardiogram with contrast suggested a possible focal apical aneurysm, but the study was suboptimal to assess. Because of the suboptimal apical imaging by echocardiogram, cardiac MRI with gadolinium was obtained and showed near transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the lateral wall with a focal apical aneurysm (shown in Fig. ). Laboratory assessment for thrombophilia was negative, and an implantable loop recorder was placed to assess for occult atrial fibrillation. Upon review of his clinical picture, country of origin, and imaging studies, his risk for CCC became apparent, and Trypanosoma cruzi IgG testing was performed. Both commercial serologic testing and CDC confirmation with ELISA and TESA blot assays confirmed this diagnosis.

Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for hypertension is absent. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.

    "problem": "<Context> The patient was a 30-year-old primipara with a twin pregnancy at 36 weeks. She had an accompanying premature rupture of the membrane and had planned to have a cesarean section. She did not have a past medical history and her height and weight was 164 cm and 69 kg, respectively. The physical examination, blood test, urine analysis, chest x-ray, and EKG were all within normal limits (). Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was planned because the patient wanted regional anesthesia for the twin pregnancy and there were with no special contraindications.\nPreanesthesia medication was not used. EKG monitoring, non-invasive automatic blood pressure measuring, and pulse oximetry were set up after the patient arrived at the surgical theatre. The patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg; heart rate was 90 beats per minute before induction. 3 L of oxygen was provided through nasal prong while observing the patient's vital signs. She was positioned left lateral decubitus for the regional anesthesia using an 18 G modified Tuohy (Espocan®, B. Brown, Germany) needle, and epidural access between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae was attempted. Right after the puncture, bleeding was observed through the needle, and the puncture needle was immediately removed. Compression was attempted for bleeding control. Since there was no observed bleeding or hematoma in the puncture area, a second attempt at puncture was tried between the second and third lumbar vertebrae with a 27 G subarachnoid needle inserted in an 18 G epidural needle after examining the epidural area with the loss of resistance technique. After observing spontaneous flow of CSF fluid, 5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine dextrose was injected, and then, the subarachnoid needle was removed. The subarachnoid needle bevel was toward the cephalic, with a 20 G epidural catheter (Perifix® soft tip, Braun, Germany) located 3 cm from the cephalic. Then, the patient was repositioned to the supine position. There were no difficulties during the procedure, and she did not complain of any dysesthesia, numbness, or pain. After no blood or CSF had been aspirated, a 3 ml test amount of epinephrine (1 : 200,000) was injected through the epidural catheter with a 3-minute observation period. The patient was stable with blood pressure at 130/80 mmHg and heart rate at 95 beats per minute. 10 minutes after intraspinal injection, the level of the sensory block was at the tenth thoracic spinal nerve segment. In order to increase the level of the sensory block, after checking again that no blood had been aspirated, 5 ml of 2% lidocaine mixed with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) was injected repeatedly with a total of 20 ml being injected. After 20 minutes, the level of the sensory block did not change remaining at the tenth thoracic spinal nerve segment. Therefore, it became necessary to switch to general anesthesia. 250 mg of Thiopental and 75 mg of succinylcholine were infused. After observed loss of consciousness and muscle relaxation, intubation was done. While the surgery was proceeding, the anesthesia was maintained using 2 L/min of O2, 2 L/min of N2O, 5 vol% of desflurane, and 4 mg of vecuronium until the babies were delivered. 4 minutes after induction, the baby boy was delivered through cesarean section, and the baby girl was delivered 1 minute after the birth of the boy. The babies weighed 2.4 kg and 2.6 kg with 5-minute-apgar scores of 7 and 8. After the placenta was expelled, 20 units of oxytocin mixed with 100 ml of normal saline were infused, but uterine contraction did not successfully proceed. Bleeding of more than 3,000 ml occurred in the 5 minutes after delivery. 0.2 mg of methylergonovine was injected to advance uterine contraction, but the bleeding continued. Her hemoglobin level dropped to 8.4 mg/dl. Since massive bleeding was not expected before operation, there was no blood prepared. One hour after the operation, 2 units of packed RBCs prepared under emergency conditions were transfused. Crystalloid solution and colloid solution was infused before the transfusion with repeated injections of ephedrine to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg. After the operation, blood pressure was maintained above 90/40 mmHg without an inotropic or vasopressor agent. Total anesthetic time was 2 hours 10 minutes; the operation time was 1 hour 20 minutes. Total bleeding during anesthesia was approximately 4,000 ml; urine amount was approximately 200 ml, and 2 units of packed RBCs were transfused. 1,000 ml crystalloid and 2,000 ml colloid solutions were infused. In the recovery room, the patient received an extra 2 units of packed RBCs and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused.\nAfter arriving at the recovery room, the level of the sensory block was below T12. She was transferred to the ward after 1 hour after partial recovery of sensory and motor function was observed and the epidural catheter was removed. Right after arriving at the ward, a blood test was done; hemoglobin was 10.1 mg/dl with prolonged PT and aPTT each measured at 21.1 sec and 52.3 sec, respectively. Vaginal bleeding continued after arriving at the ward. Intrauterine compression was attempted by foley catheter insertion and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. 4 hours after the operation, PT and aPTT were 19.3 sec and 46.4 sec. Hemoglobin level decreased to 7.1 mg/dl and platelet count decreased to 82,000/mm3. 3 units of packed RBCs and 10 units of platelet concentrate were transfused. The vaginal bleeding continued but decreased.\nAt the ward, the patient complained of abdominal pain and back pain but was able to get some sleep by controlling pain through patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA). Next morning, 10 hours after the operation, the back pain continued, and sensory and motor paralysis on both lower extremities were observed. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done and a compressive mass was found at the posterior of the lumbar vertebrae (). Acute epidural hematoma was diagnosis, and an infusion of high dose steroid therapy was carried out. The patient was transferred to the surgical theatre 4 hours after symptoms developed. An emergency decompression laminectomy was done to get rid of the epidural hematoma at the L2/L3 segment of the lumbar vertebrae. The patient's coagulation process did not work well and more than 1,000 ml of bleeding occurred with 3 units of packed RBCs being transfused. After the operation, motor and sensory function of the lower extremities did not change but the pain in the back had mildly improved. However, 1 day after the hematoma was removed, the back pain had become aggravated. Another emergency MRI was done and the hematoma was found to have occurred again, and the operation was done again. She complained of excessive numbness in her lower extremities but muscle strength gradually recovered. One month after the operation, she was discharged after she was able to walk without any working aid with some restrictions. Five months after the operation, neurological symptoms were totally improved without any sequelae. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He noted the symptoms began one week prior and were associated with dysphagia, decreased oral intake, and intermittent fevers. He denied symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, myalgias, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Vital signs upon admission revealed a temperature of 98.4 degrees F, blood pressure of 135/65 mmHg, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical exam upon admission revealed a comfortable, awake, alert, and oriented patient. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs. The pulmonary exam revealed clear lungs to anterior and posterior auscultation with no wheezes, rales, or diminished breath sounds. Abdominal exam revealed normal bowel sounds, and a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Oral and neck exam was significant for an erythematous and swollen right tonsil and tenderness to palpation of the right anterior neck with associated submandibular and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, respectively. Laboratory findings were significant for a leukocytosis to 16.5 K/UL. A CT scan of the head and neck was obtained and was significant for right peritonsillar edema with tracking along the lateral pharyngeal wall consistent with phlegmon (Figure ).\nAssociated lymphadenopathy included the involvement of the internal jugular chain, posterior triangle, bilateral supraclavicular, and submandibular lymph nodes. The epiglottis was without enlargement. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells were clear. A throat swab was obtained for bacterial culture, and meanwhile, clindamycin was started.

    "Lower Limit": "2",
    "Upper Limit": "2",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0. The patient's temperature is 98.4 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 66.4 = 36.889 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's heart rate is 81.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0. The patient's concentration of white blood cell is 16500.0 count/µL. To convert 16500.0 count/µL of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 which will give 16500.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1000000000.0 µL/m^3 = 16500000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2. The final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.

    "problem": "<Context> An Asian male infant was born by vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation, with a birth weight of 3410 g, to a 34-year-old mother (gravida: 3; parity: 1; preterm: 0; miscarriage: 1; liveborn: 1) with pregnancy notable for fetal diagnosis of left-sided CDH. Maternal obstetrical history was significant for an ectopic pregnancy and an uncomplicated birth of a healthy, term male infant. Family history was significant for a maternal uncle who died at 21 years of age and another maternal uncle and two maternal male cousins who died in early childhood, all due reportedly to adrenal issues. Given prenatal diagnosis and family history, both parents underwent Sema4 expanded carrier screening with no significant findings. Both parents screened negative for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Amniocentesis revealed karyotype as 46,XY.\nPhysical examination at birth was notable for decreased breath sounds on the left side of the chest consistent with CDH, scaphoid abdomen, upslanting palpebral fissure, high-arched palate, smooth philtrum, and mild ankyloglossia. Skin exam was normal with no hyperpigmentation. Testes were descended bilaterally with a normal phallus.\nPreoperative renal ultrasound was significant for mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Echocardiogram on day of life 2 revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. He underwent uncomplicated repair of CDH on day of life 3. He remained hemodynamically stable before, during, and in the immediate postoperative period. He was extubated on day of life 8, successfully transitioned to room air by day of life 10, and reached full oral feeds by day of life 14. On day of life 17, he was noted to have decreased oral feeding and a brief episode of self-resolved bradycardia. A rule-out-sepsis workup was initiated. Soon after, the patient developed a prolonged generalized seizure, unresponsive to intravenous phenobarbital, and required emergent intubation.\nInitial laboratory results were notable for severe hyponatremia (Na+: 111 mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (K+: 9.2 mmol/L), a glucose level of 51 mg/dL, an arterial pH of 7.49, and a bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L (reference range: 25–32 mmol/L) (Figures and ). He was treated with intravenous hypertonic saline, calcium gluconate, furosemide, an insulin infusion, dextrose 12.5% infusion, and albuterol nebulization. He was started on dopamine infusion secondary to systemic hypotension. Given this compilation of symptoms, adrenal insufficiency was suspected and hydrocortisone was initiated.\nOver the next 48 hours, electrolyte derangements resolved. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative, and antibiotics were discontinued. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. Initial video electroencephalogram was significant for epileptiform discharges but no seizures. An extensive endocrine evaluation was conducted. Some initial diagnostic labs were unable to be sent before the patient received hydrocortisone and hypertonic saline. Available labs were notable for low aldosterone (5.4 ng/dL, reference range: 7–99 ng/dL), normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (87 μg/dL, reference range: 32–431 μg/dL), and normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone (159 ng/dL, reference range: <199 ng/dL). The sample for plasma renin was of insufficient quantity. The cortisol level was sent after starting hydrocortisone and thus deemed inconclusive.\nRenal sonogram revealed a normal right adrenal and nonvisualized left adrenal gland. In view of the unconfirmed etiology and unrevealing testing by then, the baby was trialed off hydrocortisone on day of life 22, but hyponatremia and hyperkalemia recurred the following day with Na+ of 116 mmol/L and K+ of 9.9 mmol/L. The repeat cortisol level at this time was normal at 10.1 μg/dL, and renin and aldosterone levels could not be obtained because of insufficient sample. Hydrocortisone was restarted, along with fludrocortisone and sodium chloride (NaCl) supplements. Enteral feeds were restarted with low mineral formula, Similac® PM 60/40. He had an additional episode of electrolyte derangement on day of life 43, which was managed by adjusting the dosage of hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and NaCl supplementation. Prior to discharge at 10 weeks of age, aldosterone remained low (3.8 ng/dL, reference range: 7–99 ng/dL), with normal renin levels (20.5 ng/ml/hr, reference range: 2.4–37 ng/mL/hr) on treatment. Newborn screening and microarray sent during admission were normal. He was subsequently discharged home on hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and NaCl supplements.\nWe considered the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) and requested DNA test of the NR0B1 gene that is associated with AHC. Single gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis of the NR0B1 gene (NM_000475.4) identified a variant of uncertain significance (VUS): c.1142T>C (p.Leu381Pro). This variant has never been reported before and is not present in population databases []. Different missense variants at this codon have been reported in individuals affected with X-linked AHC []. Missense pathogenic variants in NR0B1 and the variant seen in our patient are located in the same protein domain []. These publications suggest that the leucine residue and the structural domain it resides may be critical for the NR0B1 protein (DAX1) function [, ]. The mother was found to carry the same variant, which was absent in the 14-year-old unaffected brother. Therefore, this variant is likely clinically significant and is consistent with a diagnosis of X-linked AHC in our patient.\nAt 15 months of age, the patient is receiving physical and feeding therapy for oropharyngeal dysphagia. He is walking, has words, and is increasing his solid intake. He is currently on physiologic hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and NaCl supplementation. He has not had any electrolyte abnormalities since discharge from the hospital. He is followed every 2-3 months and will be monitored closely during adolescence for pubertal signs, as most children with AHC do not go into spontaneous puberty. </Context> <Question> What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "problem": "<Context> The last patient was a 4-year-old female. Following an uncomplicated pregnancy with no ultrasound abnormalities or polyhydramnios, she was born to a G1P1 mother and nonconsanguineous parents. The patient’s mother had had a history of renal stones and recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to a vesicoureteral reflux. The maternal great uncle had received a renal transplant in his mid-40s, though the reason for the transplant was unknown. There was no other family history of renal disease or hearing loss. The child had a long-standing history of dysmorphic features and spastic dystonic diplegia. Her symptoms were consistent with those found on the Galloway-Mowat syndrome spectrum and included microcephaly, cerebellar atrophy, developmental delay and seizures, and proteinuria, with an absence of infantile nephrotic syndrome. Her dysmorphic features included prominent large ears, frontal bossing, a broad nasal bridge, a high arch palate, and scarce eyebrows. In the past, she had exhibited failure to thrive and developmental delay that had progressed since the age of 8 months. She was followed by the genetics clinic because of her developmental delay and her dysmorphic features, which could not be linked to a particular diagnosis or syndrome. She had no previous episodes of dehydration, polyuria, or polydipsia.\nShe initially presented with status epilepticus and hypomagnesemia at the age of 4. Her anthropomorphic parameters were within normal limits: weight (10.0 kg—below the 3rd percentile), height (94 cm—between the 3rd and 10th percentiles), and head circumference (44.5 cm—below the 3rd percentile). She was placed on valproic acid following her first seizure and experienced significant side effects including lethargy and severe drooling.\nShe had 2 subsequent hypomagnesemia-associated episodes of status epilepticus; her most recent episode had been complicated by an extended spectrum β-lactamase Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. Her lowest magnesium level was 0.31 mmol/L [reference interval 0.65-1.05] (0.75 mg/dL) and her calcium level was normal at 2.31 mmol/L [reference interval 2.15-2.55] (9.24 mg/dL). Her fractional excretion of magnesium was elevated at 26%. There was no evidence of hypercalciuria (calcium to creatinine ratio 0.35 [reference interval < 0.6] mmol/mmol). Aside from transiently low serum potassium, her serum bicarbonate level, urate level, and fractional potassium excretion were normal. Exome sequencing was performed to verify the CNNM2 mutation differential diagnosis, which is associated with hypomagnesemia and impaired brain development. This test was negative and there was no association with any other known magnesium-losing tubulopathies. No abnormalities were noted in the WDR73 gene, which is associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome. A head MRI revealed diffuse cerebral white matter signal abnormalities evocative of demyelination along with progressive atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. The numerous EEGs that were performed while she took her maintenance antiepileptics showed that her epileptic activity ceased when her magnesium levels normalized. Her EEG had a background of δ grade II generalized activity, with suppression of grade I activity in the right hemisphere.\nThe patient’s seizures were difficult to control, requiring phenytoin (15 mg/kg loading dose) and intubation with a midazolam infusion during her episodes of status epilepticus. Her serum magnesium levels normalized after several days of magnesium sulfate infusions (14 mg/kg/h), after which she was switched to oral magnesium oxide (120 mg/kg/d). The addition of amiloride was necessary to maintain stable magnesium levels, and following another episode of status epilepticus, some of the magnesium oxide was replaced with magnesium bisglycinate to reduce diarrhea. If her magnesium levels fall below 0.65 mmol/L, she usually experiences seizures. She is also on enalapril to control her hypertension and proteinuria, which are commonly seen in Galloway-Mowat syndrome. </Context> <Question> Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? </Question>",

    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day. The patient's dose of Codeine is 40 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Codeine. This means that the patient takes 40 mg/dose Codeine * 2 dose/day = 80 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Codeine, multiply the 80 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.15 mme/mg, giving us 12.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Codeine to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 12.0 = 12.0 mme/day. The patient's dose of FentANYL patch is 50 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of FentANYL patch. This means that the patient takes 50 mg/dose FentANYL patch * 1 dose/day = 50 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of FentANYL patch, multiply the 50 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 2.4 mme/mg, giving us 120.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of FentANYL patch to the total mme/day gives us 12.0 + 120.0 = 132.0 mme/day. The patient's dose of Morphine is 10 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Morphine. This means that the patient takes 10 mg/dose Morphine * 2 dose/day = 20 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Morphine, multiply the 20 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 20 mme/day.

Complete blood count results were as follows: leukocyte count, 8290/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL; and platelet count, 545000/mm3. The sedimentation rate was 38 mm/hour. A thoracic ultrasonography revealed septated pleural fluid with a dense content, which reached a depth of up to 30 mm. A thoracic catheter was placed, and intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator was administered three times. Intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin were administered. A thoracic computed tomography was taken, showing multiple lymph nodes having a conglomerated appearance, the largest of which measured 18 mm × 13 mm, in the mediastinal pretracheal, subcarinal, and right hilar regions.

The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender. The patient is 11 years old. The patient's is a Male. The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6. The patient's weight is 30.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 132.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 132.0 mEq. To convert from 132.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 132.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 132.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 132.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 132.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 132.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 30.0 * (132.0/140 - 1) = -1.03 L.

The patient was previously diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treated with the inhaled steroid, fluticasone; 250 μg every 12 h, for approximately 3 years prior to admission. A lumbosacral spine x-ray showed age-related mild to moderate cartilage degeneration (Fig. ).\nSpinal anesthesia was administered by a board certified anesthesiologist of the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologist (TK). With the patient in the right lateral position, lumbar puncture was performed at L3-4 inter-space with a 25-gauge Quincke needle via a midline approach. Although the click of dural puncture was felt, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could not be tapped in two repeated attempts. The spinal needle was checked for deformation or obstruction by tissue and blood clots, but none were observed. A subsequent was made with a 23-gauge needle at L2-3 interspace. After removal of the stylet, backflow of CSF was not detected even after aspiration using a 2.0 ml syringe. After discussion, the anesthesiologist decided to proceed with general anesthesia instead, to which the patient also agreed. Subsequent, anesthesia and surgery proceeded uneventfully. On postoperative day one, the patient complained of moderate intensity headache mainly located in the occipital region, and aggravated by sitting posture. On examination, it was found that except postural headache, there were no associated complaints of vomiting, neck rigidity, or localized signs. It was therefore diagnosed as a case of postdural puncture headache (PDPH). The PDPH was managed conservatively with fluids, bed rest, oral acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and oral caffeine. The patient’s headache gradually subsided by the 4th postoperative day. The patient had no neurological complaints or symptoms throughout his hospitalization and was discharged on postoperative day 6.\nApproximately 2 months after discharge, the patient reported progressive lower back pain associated with left leg weakness and numbness. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an epidural mass located at the posterior aspect of the spinal canal extending from the level of L3 to S1 (Fig. ). The lesion showed increased intensity on T1-weighted images, compatible with fat. The axial image demonstrated an epidural fat compression of the thecal sac (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SEL. A surgical procedure was carried out on the laminectomy from L3 to L5 and the pathology was confirmed as SEL.

    "Upper Limit": "81.2",
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 66.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 100.0 mm Hg = 77.333 mm Hg. Hence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 77.333 mm Hg.",
